Ladies and gents, turn up your sound systems to the sound of Carlos Santana and the G&B, it's The Product of get-away blues from the refugee camp

[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh, Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 1: David McRae]
Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox, there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said see you later
[Pre-Chorus: Santana & Wyclef Jean]
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (East Coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (West Coast)
[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh, Maria, Maria

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 2: David McRae]
I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

[Bridge: Santana & Wyclef Jean]
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula

Maria, you know you're my lover
When the wind blows, I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we're apart
It feels like we're together

I just wanted you to comfort me
When I called you late last night you see
I was falling' into love
Oh yes, I was crashing' into love
Oh of all the words you sang to me
About life, the truth and being' free yea

All the while you were in front of me I never realized

And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it, I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me
[Verse 2]
Just to think you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love
The words you said you sang to me
And you showed me where I wanna be
Yea you sang to me, oh you sang to me

All the while you were in front of me I never realized

3,2000,Faith Hill,Breathe,"[Intro]
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 1]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 2]
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now
[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Being with you gets me that way"
4,2000,Enrique Iglesias,Be With You,"[Verse 1]
Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours, but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast, but it feels so cold
And I'm all alone (All alone)
Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby, just give me a sign

[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep, I'm up all night
Through these tears, I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand can save my life
But don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you somehow
[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down
Come to me now

[Bridge]
I got to be with you somehow
And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now?
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)

[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
Just wanna be with you (Be with you)

Wanna be with you

Just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up, or try again
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?
Tell all the boys, or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off, or would you stay, oh?

6,2000,Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

7,2000,Vertical Horizon,Everything You Want,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return
[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know"

Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent"
9,2000,Macy Gray,I Try,"[Verse 1]
Games, changes and fears
When will they go from here?
When will they stop?
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together, babe
But we're not

[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Verse 2]
I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey!
[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Bridge]
Here is my confession
May I be your possession?
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses, and such
With all my might, I try
But this I can't deny
Deny

[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
(But I'm dreaming of you, babe)
I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning
[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble (Oh!)
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble (Hey, yeah, yeah!)
Though I try to hide it, it's clear (Sick of love)
My world crumbles when you are not near (Love, your love, kisses ends)
Goodbye and I choke (Goodbye and I choke, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not, then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe, you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?

Can you take me higher?

There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

Please don't come around talking about how you changed

Say you wanna change, I won't

You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe
It's totally bonafide, mmm

[Verse 2]
It's not the way you walk
And it ain't the way you talk
It ain't the job you got
That keeps me satisfied

Your love, it feels so good
And that's what takes me high
Higher than I've been before
Your love, it keeps me alive
Thought I should let you know
That your touch, it means so much
When I'm alone at night
It's you I'm always thinking of
Ooh, oh, baby

Ooh, I want you to understand
How I feel, yeah, deep inside
Oh-ho, you make me feel
What I need to feel, yes
In my heart

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby, when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never been this close to anyone, or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams

[Chorus]
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I want to spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby, I'm amazed by you

The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby, you surround me
You touch every place in my heart

Oh, it feels like the first time every time
I want to spend the whole night in your eyes

[Intro: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh uh uh
It's big pimpin' baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We doin' big pimpin' up in NYC
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise
[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T

We be big pimpin' in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
[Verse 4: JAY-Z]
On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' down in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s
We be big pimpin' in P.A.T
It's just that Jigga Man, Pimp C, and B-U-N B"
23,2000,Nelly,(Hot S**t) Country Grammar,"To honor the 25th anniversary of Billboard's Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the tally's top 100 tracks ever

Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture

So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential ""Yo! MTV Raps"" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation

While rap has evolved, there’s no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboard’s Hot Rap Songs chart, we’re counting down the top 100 songs in the tally’s quarter-century history.

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

[Verse 1]
The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die
[Verse 2]
You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here
[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die"
25,2000,Carl Thomas,I Wish,"[Verse 1]
It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it went
Someone had to lose

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
Wish I never, wish I never"
26,2000,Santana Featuring Rob Thomas,Smooth,"[Verse 1]
Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Bridge]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
[Bridge]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Outro]
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
(Gimme your heart, make it real)
Let's don't forget about it (hey)
Let's don't forget about it (no oh no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (no no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)

The walls are closing in on you
It's hard to find relief
And people can be so cold

And you feel like you can't take anymore

With the monsters in your head

Let me be the one you call
If you jump, I'll break your fall
Lift you up and fly away with you into the night
If you need to fall apart

Because there has always been heartache and pain
And when it's over, you'll breathe again
You'll breathe again

30,2000,Chad Brock,Yes!,"She moved into my old apartment
That's how we got this whole thing started
She called and said that I had mail waiting there for me
I told her that I'd come and get it
How could I know in just a minute
That I'd be standing face to face with my own destiny
Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise
She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

So I called the preacher, family, and friends
And nothin's been the same since

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

She said yes"
31,2000,Westlife,Swear It Again,"[Verse 1]
I wanna know
Who ever told you I was letting go
The only joy that I have ever known
Girl, they were lying
Just look around
And all of the people that we used to know
Have just given up, they wanna let it go
But we're still trying

[Pre-Chorus]
So you should know this love we share was never made to die
I'm glad we're on this one-way street just you and I
Just you and I

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again
All over again
[Verse 2]
Some people say
That everything has got its place in time
Even the day must give way to the night
But I'm not buying
'Cause in your eyes
I see a love that burns eternally
And if you see how beautiful you are to me
You'll know I'm not lying

[Pre-Chorus]
Sure there'll be times we wanna say goodbye but even if we try
There are some things in this life won't be denied
Won't be denied

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna say goodbye
'Cause I never wanna see you cry
I swore to you my love would remain
And I swear it all over again and I
I'm never gonna treat you bad
'Cause I never wanna see you sad
I swore to share your joy and your pain
And I swear it all over again

[Bridge]
The more I know of you is the more I know I love you
And the more that I'm sure I want you forever and ever more
And the more that you love me, the more that I know
Oh that I'm never gonna let you go
Gotta let you know that I

That got you think that you Superman, I got the Kryptonite
Should I smack him with my dick or the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? (Hmm), let's add up all the factors
You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You broke, the kid ain't yours and everybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?""
""I love my baby mother, I'll never let her go""
I'm tired of weak-ass niggas whining over puss

Who get it all on the strength of the hands with them, man

You keep walking, 'less you tryna end up red
'Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead

Fake up North type nigga
Get pushed like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brung out
Run up in there, everybody come out, don't nobody burn out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga running his mouth, I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, your ass is about to be missin'
You know who gon' find you? (Who?), some old man fishin'
Grandma wishin' your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

33,2000,Nine Days,Absolutely (Story Of A Girl),"[Chorus 1]
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 1]
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

[Chorus 1]
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles
[Verse 2]
Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
Now how do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Listen, babe

[Verse 1]
Every time I see you, I get a bad vibe
Just thinkin' of someone else in between your thighs
And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me
That's why I say

And when we were together
We never turned our backs on each other
But now that we're separated
We can't stand one another

36,2000,Andy Griggs,She's More,"I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers
So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more"
37,2000,Vitamin C,Graduation (Friends Forever),"[Verse 1]
And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
Keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now cause you don't have another day (Another day)
'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
And I keep thinking of that night in June
I didn't know much of love, but it came too soon (Came too soon)
And there was me and you, and then we got real blue
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

[Chorus]
As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever
[Verse 2]
So if we get the big jobs, and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school?
Still be trying to break every single rule (Every rule)
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with a tan?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
And this is how it feels

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

La, la, la, la...
Yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la...
We will still be friends forever
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there?
Can we make it somehow? (Somehow)
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly, it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (It's not goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

[Chorus]
As we go on (Ooh)
We remember (We remember)
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (We will always be friends)
Friends forever
As we go on (As we go on)
We remember (Yeah)
All the times we (Yeah)
Had together (Ooh)
And as our lives change
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (Hey, yeah)
Friends forever
As we go on (We will always)
We remember (We will always remember)
All the times we
Had together (yeah)
And as our lives change (As our lives change)

39,2000,Clay Walker,The Chain Of Love,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis""
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you
Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you
That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
""Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."""
40,2000,Donell Jones,Where I Wanna Be,"[Verse 1]
I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin' I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time
To be alone

[Hook 1]
But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave
She's crying her heart to me
How could you let this be?
I just need time to see
Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be...

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee...
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...
[Verse 2]
Never did I imagine
That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most
Girl, the love that we share is real
But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like
Without you

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave

See when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave

43,2000,Collin Raye,Couldn't Last A Moment,"I thought it was over
I thought I could move on
But I was wrong
I woke up last night
Calling your name
Feeling the blame baby

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

You've got every right
To turn and walk away
I can't make you stay
I broke your heart
That's the bottom line
I wasted so much precious time, baby
I see with your friend
Wearing a smile again
What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?
Girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment without you

Thought I could quit you but
I still miss your love

What was I thinking?
Thinking I could still walk down the street
Without you by my side
Or make it through one night
Alone, I lied
I said a lot of things
I didn't really mean
How can I make you see
What matters most to me?

I couldn't last a moment without you
Oh girl I should have known it
I couldn't last a moment(moment)
Without you

You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 3]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

[Verse 4]
Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone

Pre chorus:
And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok

Chorus:
But u can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let u go
Son my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away
Pre Chorus:
And before u slammed that door
U said i hate u
But tonightif u could only hear me say

I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I've forgot all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve

Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine

You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so

And I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far

[Verse 1: Sting]
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

Aman aman aman

No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on

59,2000,Son By Four,Purest Of Pain (A Puro Dolor),"Sorry didn't mean to call you but i couldn't fight it
I guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it
And so i surrendered, just to hear your voice

Don't know how many times i said i'm gonna live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something, baby you need to know
That deep inside me, i feel like i'm dying. i have to see you, it's all that i'm asking

(chorus)
Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live
The air that i breathe
Cari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely
And each night i taste the purest of pain

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte. agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuelveme mis fantasias, mis ganas de vivir la vida, devuelveme el aire
Cari?o mio, sin tin yo me siento vacio, las tardes son un laberinto, las noches
Me saben, a puro dolor

Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live

60,2000,Mya Featuring Jadakiss,Best Of Me,"[Intro: Jadakiss, Mýa (Jadakiss)]
Uh, huh
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha
Yo, yo
Woah, put it on me
I can't let (Nah, yeah)
Let him go no (I just wanna do what's best for you)
Can't let you get, oh no (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Mýa]
He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out (Oh no)
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
[Chorus]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me)

[Verse 2: Mýa]
So is he trying to play with my head?
Tellin' me how he could blow my mind
Somethin' 'bout the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hand's up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me, Yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss (Mýa)]
I got so many bags of money that they won't fit in the bank
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'mma make sure both y'all win
Let him keep the place, you move and I'mma pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge
You know, literally, we could go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she ain't wanna get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look (Put it on me)
Channel look, mixed with the Pete Arnell look
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city (Put it on me)
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty, we livin' it up
I put it on your ass if you're givin' it up
And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you call him up later
And tell him you all Jada's
[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you (Oh no)
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside (I can't let you)
Something's dying to see (No)
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me (Baby even though)
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

[Chorus]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Oh yeah, oh...

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me"
61,2000,George Strait,The Best Day,"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel
He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life"
62,2000,Tim McGraw,Some Things Never Change,"[Verse 1]
After all this time I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change

[Verse 2]
When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change

I still love you"

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open

[Verse 2]
Well I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life

With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything

With arms wide open
Wide open
[Guitar Solo: Mark Tremonti]

If I had just one wish only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands
That he can take this life and hold it by the hand
And he can greet the world with arms wide open

[Chorus]
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place I'll show you everything
With arms wide open now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything

70,2000,Splender,I Think God Can Explain,"There's a lot of things I understand
And there's a lot of things that I don't want to know
But you're the only face I recognize
It's so sweet of you to look me in the eyes

It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I'm relieved, I'm relaxed
I'll get over it, yeah

The scent of vaseline in the summertime
The feel of an ice cube melting over time
The world seems bigger than both of us
Yet it seems so small when I begin to cry

It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I'm relieved, I'm relaxed
I'll get over it, yeah
I'm so much better than you guessed
I'm so much bigger than you guessed
I'm so much brighter than you guessed

It's alright, I'm ok
I think God can explain
I believe I'm the same
I get carried away
It's alright, I'm ok

71,2000,Eric Heatherly,Flowers On The Wall,"I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness
But all that thought you've given me is, conscience I guess
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none
While you and your friends are worryinbout me, I'm havin'lots of fun

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time

(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do

It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete
(Chorus)
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn, with a deck of fifty-one
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do
Now don't tell me
I've nothin' to do"
72,2000,Elton John,Someday Out Of The Blue,"[Intro]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

[Verse 1]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon
[Verse 2]
I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me

[Chorus]
Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

[Bridge]
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us
I still believe, I still put faith in us

[Verse 3]
Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

You can catch me in the cherry red one-fifty
Got the Glizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy, going sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin' to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin' bottles up in Sue's Rendevous
Fuck that! Spun the U-ey, lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack, came back in a ""What's that?""
Straight from Paris, checkin' Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nothin' less, ‘cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one; got beef, bust yo' gun
You don't need no one talking 'bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo; Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin' heat, throwin' bolos, it's hard

[Hook: Donnell Jones]
And it's so hard, yeah
Niggas wanna be like Pun
But they don't bust they guns
And it's so hard
Niggas wanna fuck my wife
Nggas wanna take my life

Rollin' with the Squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars, strip bars in Miami
Almost came home with the Grammy
Next year, bringing home three for the family
Watch me, you can catch it live on the Hitachi
Poppin' shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that! Liberace, fo'-X Versace, somebody stop me!
Never that! SKEE-YU! Where my niggas at?
Uptown, uptown, you know you feelin' that
Cash rule, hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me, One More Chance
Take a glance and I'm off with yours
With both hands take off my drawers
And jerk me like the Source Awards
I love hip-hop, I ain't even probably the best lyricist alive
Terror Squad, nigga, stop sleepin'!

And if you just hatin', just walk on by
All you haters just walk on by
See, me and Big Pun be rollin'

Better just walk on by
While we role back and talk for a while
And to the Boricuas, stay up, stay up, stay up!
And to all my homies, you gotta know what's up!"

Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On top out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper
Look good enough to be taken shopping
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping
[Chorus: Ginuwine & Nas]
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice (yeah)
Now let's say you owe me something
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl
Shorty, say what's your price (uh huh)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again

[Bridge: Ginuwine]
I put the shackles on your feet (you owe me)
I think you owe me some (you owe me)
The shackles on your feet (you owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (you owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

[Verse 3: Nas]
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night (End of the night, babe)
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion
[Outro: Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
(Say what's your price, baby)
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something (oh)
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up
(You owe Ginuwine)
You can hold my ice
(You owe Timbaland)
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe, owe, owe, owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh"
82,2000,Phil Vassar,Carlene,"I was lousy at math, failed historian
Carlene was the valedictorian
I was the quarter back in the back of classes
She was the whiz kid in horned rim glasses

It's been a long time since I've been around
Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car
She said, ""I bet you don't remember, I guess it's been forever.""
It took a second to put it all together and I said

Ooh la la la la la

Girl you glitter like hollywood
Good god carlene
You sure are lookin good

She said hop in let's go for a spin
Tell me whatcha been doing boy and where you been
I said I write songs, you probably didn't know, but I
Finally got a couple out on country radio
She said, ""What a switch, ain't life funny, I've got a PHD
Now I'm modeling for money.""
Imagine little miss 4.0 just smiling for the camera on the cover of Vogue
I said you've come a long way since graduation
Let me say without hesitation
You've surpassed everyone's expectations

Screenplay by Quentin Tarantino

When you are tired of relationships, try a romance.

INT. BAR √ NIGHT

A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.

CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older
lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,
you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.

CLARENCE
In ""Jailhouse Rock"" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck
about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and
leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big
he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and
he's singing, ""Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care"". Now, they got
him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this
horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him
wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,
big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd
watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most
women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my
life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.
Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY
I'd fuck Elvis.

CLARENCE
Really?

LUCY
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

CLARENCE
I don't blame you.
(they laugh)
So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests,
isn't it?

Lucy laughs.

CLARENCE
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?

LUCY
How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
LUCY
What are we gonna see?

CLARENCE
A Donny Chiba triple feature. ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the
Streetfighter"", and ""Sister Streetfighter"".

LUCY
Who's Sonny Chiba?

CLARENCE
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

LUCY
(not believing this)
You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?

CLARENCE
(holding up three fingers)
Three kung fu movies.

Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

LUCY
(laughing)
I don't think so, not my cup of tea.
INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots
and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained
black.

On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of
cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the
suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. ""Bewitched"" is
playing.

At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and
FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic
bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't
know it listen to him.

DREXL
Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.

FLOYD
Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.

DREXL
That's bullshit.

BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl
and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in
two greasy brown-paper bags.

FLOYD
Naw man, that's some serious shit.

DREXL
Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

BIG D
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
DREXL
Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.
BIG D
Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.
DREXL
I heard that.
FLOYD
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
BIG D
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every
motherfuckin' thang.

DREXL
Preach on, Big D.

FLOYD
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy √ I would never eat any pussy √ but,
if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be
ashamed as a motherfucker.

BIG D
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass
things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin'
niggers' dicks.

DREXL
Heard that.

Drexl and Big D bump fists.

FLOYD
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.
(he takes a hit off of a joint)
There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their
pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with
white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit √

DREXL
√ Because it's good!

FLOYD
Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because
you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for
every nigger in the world everywhere.

BIG D
Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to
express our gratitude √

Drexl and Big D bust up.

FLOYD
Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got
pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to
do a bunch of fucked-up shit.

BIG D
So you do eat pussy!

FLOYD
Naw naw!

BIG D
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
(to Drexl)
He eats it.

DREXL
Damn skippy. He like it, too.

BIG D
(mock English accent)
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.

FLOYD
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!

DREXL
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch √ you're with
Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my
dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't
suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what
do you say?

FLOYD
I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!""

BIG D
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne
County so fast √

DREXL
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.

FLOYD
I'd say fuck it!

Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd
sitting all alone.

Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching ""Bewitched"".

FLOYD
(yelling after them)
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!

BIG D
(not even looking)
Take that shit somewhere else.

DRXL
(marching back)
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

FLOYD
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.

DREXL
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,
kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,
you'd aim to please.

BIG D
(glued on TV)
I'm hip.

DREXL
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,
toss me that shotgun.

Without turning away from ""Bewitched"" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to
Drexl.

DREXL
(to Floyd)
All right, check this out.
(referring to shotgun)
Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.

Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.

Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.

Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.

The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.

Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.

Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.

Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front
door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.

EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR √ MORNING

A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a
backdrop. The song ""Little Bitty Tear"" is heard a capella.

INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR √ MORNING

CLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently
to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In
between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a
security guard uniform.

EXT. TRAILER PARK √ MORNING

Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see
something that stops him short.

CLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front
of his trailer.

CLOSEUP √ CLIFF

Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.

BACK TO:

CLIFF'S POV

Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face
through the driver's side window.

CLARENCE
Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ MORNING

All three enter the trailer home.

CLIFF
Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if
I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected
to see this morning.

Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.

CLARENCE
Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'
on thirst, you got anything to drink?

He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.

CLIFF
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.

CLARENCE
(rumaging around the fridge)
Anything stronger?
(pause)
Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

CLIFF
I can, but I don't.

CLARENCE
(closing the fridge)
That's about all I ever eat.

Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.

CLIFF
(to Girl)
I'm sorry... I'm his father.

YOUNG GIRL
(sticking her hand out)
That's OK, I'm his wife.
(shaking his hand vigorously)
Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.

She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's
where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.

Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit
magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.

CLARENCE
Oh yeah, we got married.
(referring to the magnets)
You still have these.
(to Alabama)
This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.
I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a
sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.
(to Cliff)
Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.

He hands her some money and his car keys.

CLARENCE
Go to the liquor store √
(to Cliff)
Where is there a liquor store around here?

CLIFF
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get
cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if
not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,
since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a
foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?

ALABAMA
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-
Dongs.

CLARENCE
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.
(to Cliff)
What do you think would taste good?

CLIFF
I'm really not very √

CLARENCE
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a
while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,
definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.
(to Cliff)
Where's a good chicken place around here?

CLIFF
I really don't know.

CLARENCE
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?
(to Alabama)
Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.

He gives her some more money.

CLARENCE
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.

ALABAMA
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.

She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.

CLARENCE
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is
she a four alarm fire, or what?

CLIFF
She seems very nice.

CLARENCE
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only
word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in
love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's
written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we
gotta talk √

CLIFF
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how
much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and
through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a
sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn
bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.
Now, when did you get married?

CLARENCE
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.

BLACK TITLE CARD: ""HOLLYWOOD""

INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER √ DAY

FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their
hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting
director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip
board in hand.

RAVENCROFT
Dick Ritchie?

Dick pops up from the pack.

DICK
I'm me... I mean, that's me.

RAVENCROFT
Step inside.

INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE √ DAY

She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several
posters advertising ""The Return of T.J. Hooker"" hang on the wall.

Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.

RAVENCROFT
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and
Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for
the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's
hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.
(she picks a up a copy of the script)
Whenever you're ready.

DICK
(reading and miming driving)
Where'd you come from?

RAVENCROFT
(reading from the script lifelessly)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK
(reading from script)
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

She puts her script down, and smiles at him.

RAVENCROFT
That was very good.

DICK
Thank you.

RAVENCROFT
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?

DICK
Sure. No problem.

RAVENCROFT
Could we try it now?

DICK
Absolutely.

Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.

DICK
Where'd he come from?

RAVENCROFT
(monotone, as before)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

Ravencroft puts her script down.

RAVENCROFT
Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.

Dick smiles.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ DAY

Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what
Clarence has told him.

CLARENCE
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel
free.

CLIFF
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a
joke about this √
(raising his voice)
√ I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!

Cliff pauses and collects himself.

CLIFF
What do you want from me?

CLARENCE
What?

CLIFF
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in
some way. What do you need from me? You need money?

CLARENCE
Do you still have friends on the force?

CLIFF
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

CLARENCE
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit
about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for
sure what's goin' on.
(pause)
Daddy?

CLIFF
What makes you think I could do that?

CLARENCE
You were a cop.

CLIFF
What makes you think I would do that?

CLARENCE
I'm your son.

CLIFF
You got it all worked out, don't you?

CLARENCE
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to
make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced
you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a
year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"",
""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you
were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!
Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad
parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm
basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.
And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.

ALABAMA
The forager's back.

CLARENCE
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.

ALABAMA
I didn't get any chicken.

CLARENCE
How come?

ALABAMA
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ BEDROOM √ DAY

Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od
the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are
horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all
the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's
talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.

We see both inside the conversation.

CLIFF
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

WILSON
What about him?

CLIFF
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it
might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible
for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.

WILSON
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?

CLIFF
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in
for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while
I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?

WILSON
McTeague.

CLIFF
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?

WILSON
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?

CLIFF
You and Robin moved?

WILSON
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got
myself a new place √ mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the
bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place.
I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAILER HOME √ DAY

Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing
herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.

CLIFF
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

CLARENCE
Do tell. Why drug related?

CLIFF
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.

CLARENCE
No shit?

CLIFF
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
mean anything to you?

CLARENCE
Nope.

CLIFF
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.

CLARENCE
Who is he?

CLIFF
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,
Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did
the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.

CLARENCE
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops
aren't looking for me?

CLIFF
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou
had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.

Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.

CLIFF
I got some money I can give you √

CLARENCE
Keep it.

CLIFF
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and
Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.

CLARENCE
We do make a cute couple, don't we?

CLIFF
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about.
Quit fuckin' around.
(pause)
I love you son.

They hug each other,

Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.

CLARENCE
This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but
you can get a hold of me through him.

Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.

CLARENCE
Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,

Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff
and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's
bubbling like a Fresca.

ALABAMA
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.

CLARENCE
(mock anger)
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?

ALABAMA
Oh, hush up.

The two get into the Mustang.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.

Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.

CLIFF
Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.

ALABAMA
Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.

Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends
we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time
when we will all be together again.

Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.

As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.

CLIFF
The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat
and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.

The phone rings, Dick answers.

DICK
Hi, Dick here.

INT. HOTEL SUITE √ LAS VEGAS √ SUNSET

Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window
overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.

Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.

CLARENCE
(big bopper voice)
Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!

Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation.

DICK
(unsure)
Clarence?

CLARENCE
You got it.

DICK
It's great to hear from you.

CLARENCE
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.

DICK
You comin' to L.A.? When?

CLARENCE
Tomorrow.

DICK
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?

Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-
shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.

CLARENCE
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,
I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
I'm married man.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm
not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.
Wanna say hi to my better half?

Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.

ALABAMA
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.

DICK
Hello, Alabama.

ALABAMA
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were
his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.

Clarence start dictating to her what to say.

CLARENCE
Tell him we gotta go.

ALABAMA
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.

DICK
What?

CLARENCE
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.

ALABAMA
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.

DICK
Wait a minute √

CLARENCE
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.

ALABAMA
Don't eat anything.

DICK
Alabama, could you tell Clar √

CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.

ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?

DICK
What letter?

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
What letter?

CLARENCE
The letter I sent.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
The letter he sent.

DICK
Clarence sent a letter?

CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?

ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?

DICK
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Yes.

CLARENCE
Has he looked through it yet?

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Ya looked through it?

DICK
Not yet.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Nope.

CLARENCE
Tell him to look through it.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Get it.

DICK
Let me speak to Clarence.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
He wants to speak with you.

CLARENCE
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all.
Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems
are over.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter
explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to
know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.

DICK
Money problems?

CLARENCE
Now tell him goodbye.

ALABAMA
Bye-bye.

CLARENCE
Now hang up.

She hangs up the phone.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick hears the click on the other end.

DICK
Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?

Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks
up the day's mail. He goes through it.

BILL: Southern California Gas Company.

BILL: Group W.

BILL: Fossenkemp Photography.

BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.

LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.

EXT. TRAILER √ DAY

A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in
front of it in the shape of a planet.

A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly
less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a
fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.

INT. TRAILER √ DAY

He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to
his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.

GUN CARRIER (DARIO)
Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.

Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,
standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),
and TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).

Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid
mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.

Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario
and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.

COCCOTTI
(to Frankie)
Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.

In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.

Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his
hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

COCCOTTI
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

CLIFF
I give up. Who are you?

COCCOTTI
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell
the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly
personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is
Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man
your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard
of us before. Am I correct?

CLIFF
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

COCCOTTI
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question
you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,
at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.
(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)
Want a Chesterfield?

CLIFF
No.

COCCOTTI
(as he lights up)
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful
this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his
brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road
with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a
choice.

CLIFF
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence √

Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with
his fist.

COCCOTTI
Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that
pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any
kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna
get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in
front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?

Cliff's defeated.

CLIFF
I've seen him.

COCCOTTI
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance
you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore
your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't
just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do
some business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room
blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.

CLIFF
What are you talkin' about?

COCCOTTI
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it
outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,
left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the
commode filled in all the blanks.

CLIFF
I don't believe you.

COCCOTTI
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that
I believe you. Where did they go?

CLIFF
On their honeymoon.

COCCOTTI
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they
go?

CLIFF
They didn't tell me.

Coccotti looks at him.

CLIFF
Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me
he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could
borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a
check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me
God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never
thought to ask.

Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,
quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then
whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal
on the wound. Cliff screams.

Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.

Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in
the car.

Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm
in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.

COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old
man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from
growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has
seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to
hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna
show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know
where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away
from.

The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.

CLIFF
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?

COCCOTTI
Sure.

Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.

CLIFF
Got a match?

Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.

CLIFF
Oh, don't bother. I got one.
(he lights the cigarette)
So you're a Sicilian, huh?

COCCOTTI
(intensly)
Uh-huh.

CLIFF
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find
that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians
were spawned by niggers.

All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic
Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what
he's hearing.

COCCOTTI
Come again?

CLIFF
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you
don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago
the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,
Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,
once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did
so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for
ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it
absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,
Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's
written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-
grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a
fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?

Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,
grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets
through Cliff's head.

He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his
feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,
and turns to his men.

COCCOTTI
I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity
in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this
comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me
where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this
fucked-up family for good.

Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was
all about.

Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic
banana magnet that says: ""Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and
address)"".

LENNY
Boss, get ready to get happy.

TITLE CARD: ""CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.""

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ MORNING

Dick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His
room-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.

The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the
bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles
standing in his doorway.

Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing ""Hello My Baby"" like the frog
in the old Chuck Jones cartoon.

CLARENCE/ALABAMA
Hello my baby,
Hello my honey,
Hello my ragtime gal √

DICK
Hi guys.

Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she
breaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick
and into his apartment.

CLARENCE
Wow. Neat place.

INT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND √ DAY

The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the
ultimate masterpiece hot-dog.

EXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND √ PATIO √ DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on
chili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.

ALABAMA
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid
before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,
crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and
my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow
zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus
appears, and the bus-driver says, ""Get her in here."". He forgot all about his
route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice
guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,
his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da
been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was
from. And, so there you go.

CLARENCE
And here we are.

DICK
That's a pretty amazing story.

CLARENCE
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?

DICK
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.

CLARENCE
You goin' out?

DICK
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my
acting class.

CLARENCE
Good for you.

DICK
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head
bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional
instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a
really good reading for ""T.J. Hooker"" the other day.

ALABAMA
You're gonna be on ""T.J. Hooker""?

DICK
Knock wood.

He knocks the table and then looks at it.

DICK
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.

CLARENCE
Did you meet Captain Kirk?

DICK
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.

ALABAMA
(finishing her hot-dog)
That was so good I am gonna have another.

DICK
You can't have just one.

Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.

DICK
How much of that letter was on the up and up?

CLARENCE
Every word of it.

Dick sees where Clarence's attention is.

DICK
You're really in love, aren't you?

CLARENCE
For the very first time in my life.
(pause)
Do you know what that's like?

Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.

DICK
(regretfully)
No, I don't
(he looks at Alabama)
How did you two meet?

Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.

CLARENCE
Do you remember The Lyric?

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

Sonny Chiba, as ""Streetfighter"" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists
and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.

Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on
popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

A cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the
triple feature: ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the Streetfighter"" and ""Sister
Streetfighter"". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.

A BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.

ALABAMA
One please.

BOX OFFICE GIRL
Ninety-nine cents.

ALABAMA
Which one is on now?

BOX OFFICE GIRL
""Return of the Streetfighter"". It's been on about forty-five minutes.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ LOBBY √ NIGHT

Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A
YOUNG USHER takes care of her.

ALABAMA
Can I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of
Goobers.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-
comers.

Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick
scan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the
front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats
just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.

Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He
turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.

When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine
bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.

ALABAMA
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

CLARENCE
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

ALABAMA
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.

CLARENCE
(picking popcorn out of his hair)
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.

ALABAMA
(picking popcorn out of his hair)
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You
could have been a real dick.

Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.

Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into
the movie.

They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and
taps Clarence on the shoulder.

ALABAMA
Excuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling
me in on what I missed?

Jumping on this opportunity.

CLARENCE
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.

ALABAMA
The oriental.

CLARENCE
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired
to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into
the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while
keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a
number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the
window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.

ALABAMA
Want some Goobers?

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot.

ALABAMA
I thought Sonny was the good guy.

CLARENCE
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be
bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.

They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.

TIME CUT:

On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.
THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.

The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.
They're both applauding.

ALABAMA
Great movie. Action-packed!

CLARENCE
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

ALABAMA
Sonny kicks ass.

CLARENCE
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the ""Streetfighter"". It
was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the
R.

ALABAMA
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.

CLARENCE
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?

ALABAMA
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.

CLARENCE
Is that your real name? Really?

ALABAMA
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.

She shows Clarence her driver's license.

CLARENCE
Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker
there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.
(announcer voice)
She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She
carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,
and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the
background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and
Alabama break up laughing.

CLARENCE
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

ALABAMA
I took a cab.

CLARENCE
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?

ALABAMA
Sure. Why not?

CLARENCE
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.

ALABAMA
What time is it?

CLARENCE
'Bout twelve.

ALABAMA
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?

CLARENCE
No. Not particularly.
(pause)
How come?

ALABAMA
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get
some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after
you've seen a good movie?

CLARENCE
I love to get pie after a movie.

ALABAMA
Would you like to get some pie?

CLARENCE
I'd love some pie.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT √ NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about
12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.
Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.

CLARENCE
Well, enough about the King. How about you?

ALABAMA
How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE
Tell me about yourself.

ALABAMA
There's nothing to tell.

CLARENCE
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?

ALABAMA
What do you want to know?

CLARENCE
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your
favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you
like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's
the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.

ALABAMA
Ask me them again. One by one.

CLARENCE
What do you do?

ALABAMA
I don't remember.

CLARENCE
Where are you from.

ALABAMA
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

CLARENCE
What's your favorite color?

ALABAMA
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.

CLARENCE
What's your favorite movie star?

ALABAMA
Burt Reynolds.

CLARENCE
Would you like a bite of my pie?

ALABAMA
Yes, I would.

Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.

CLARENCE
Like it?

ALABAMA
Very much. Now, where were we?

CLARENCE
What kinda music do you like?

ALABAMA
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like ""He's a Rebel"".

CLARENCE
What are your turn-ons?

ALABAMA
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like
Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

CLARENCE
Turn-offs?

ALABAMA
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only
thing that comes to mind are Persians.

CLARENCE
Do you have a fella?

She looks at Clarence and smiles.

ALABAMA
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

CLARENCE
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of
town alone?

ALABAMA
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a
form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or
where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even
know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a
Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they
told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on
me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For
some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told
him to stop and I got out.

CLARENCE
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

ALABAMA
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure
couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.

Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until
it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.

A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

ALABAMA
Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?
(eats her last piece of pie)
Where to next?

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE √ NIGHT

It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a
comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-
cool.

ALABAMA
Wow. What a swell place to work.

CLARENCE
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,
play music.

ALABAMA
How long have you worked here?

CLARENCE
Almost four years.

ALABAMA
That's a long time.

CLARENCE
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what
I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most
of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

ALABAMA
Do you get paid a lot?

CLARENCE
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow
some money if you need it. Wanna see what ""Spiderman"" number one
looks like?

ALABAMA
You bet. How much is that worth?

Clarence gets a box off the shelf.

CLARENCE
Four hundred bucks.

ALABAMA
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.

CLARENCE
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" Lunch
boxes. ""Green Hornet"" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are
main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.

She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.

ALABAMA
What's that?

CLARENCE
That's a ""Rookies"" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.
They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors
in ""The Black Hole""? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid
playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.

He pulls a plastic-cased ""Spiderman"" comic form the box.

CLARENCE
""Spiderman"", number one. The one that started it all.

Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

ALABAMA
God, Spiderman looks different.

CLARENCE
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.
Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just
disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold
on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.

He pulls out another comic.

CLARENCE
""Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos"". One of the coolest series known
to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about
four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.
(he opens one up)
Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at
this one.

We see the ""Sgt. Fury"" panels.

CLARENCE
Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on
a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a
ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain
and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't
that cool?

She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.

CLARENCE
Alabama, I'd like you to have this.

Clarence hands her the ""Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos"" comic book
that he loves so much.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,
anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.

ALABAMA
What a cool room!

She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.

Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.
Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.

ALABAMA
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you
then?

CLARENCE
Five.

She turns the page.

ALABAMA
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

CLARENCE
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

LATER √ LIVING ROOM

Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's
""Piece of My Heart"".

CLARENCE
You know when you sat behind me?

ALABAMA
At the movies?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she
doesn't want me bothering her.

ALABAMA
What would make you think that?

CLARENCE
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

ALABAMA
You're not stupid. Just wrong.

They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the
song.

ALABAMA
I love Janis.

CLARENCE
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.

ALABAMA
She OD'd, didn't she?

CLARENCE
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too
much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what
she took.

ALABAMA
You mean she got a bad batch?

CLARENCE
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the
happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't
trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her
to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she
couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.
So, she said no. And the guy says, ""Look, I really love you, and I wanna
prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what
happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it."" So she did,
and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her
a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

ALABAMA
So he really loved her?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh.

They kiss.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ DAY

It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks
around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a
robe and investigates.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ LIVING ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair
crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.

CLARENCE
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?

ALABAMA
You didn't do nothing.

CLARENCE
Did you hurt yourself?
(he takes her foot)
Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?

ALABAMA
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the
theater. I was paid to be there.

CLARENCE
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.
Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.

ALABAMA
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.

Pause.

CLARENCE
You're a whore?

ALABAMA
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.
(pause)
I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that
comic book place.

CLARENCE
""Heroes For Sale""?

ALABAMA
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

CLARENCE
Who?

ALABAMA
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into
you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was
gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I
was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich
millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.

CLARENCE
That dazzling imagination.

ALABAMA
It's over on the TV. All it says is: ""Dear Clarence."" I couldn't write
anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to
ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that
much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, ""Alabama, come clean, Let him
know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to
Drexl and fuck yourself.""

CLARENCE
Who and what is a Drexl?

ALABAMA
My pimp.

CLARENCE
You have a pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
A real live pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
Is he black?

ALABAMA
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.

CLARENCE
Is he nice?

ALABAMA
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty
decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with
Arlene the other day.

CLARENCE
What did he do to Arlene?

ALABAMA
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.

CLARENCE
This motherfucker sounds charming!

Clarence is on his feet, furious.

CLARENCE
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much
longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How
the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first
place?

ALABAMA
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an
agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They
have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-
collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five
hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry
beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in ""Dressed to Kill"". And when I was
ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says
he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's
gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or
wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the
ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last
night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it
was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a
second date.

CLARENCE
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.
Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went
together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,
you wanna marry me?

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Will you be my wife?

When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.

ALABAMA
Yes.

CLARENCE
(a little surprised)
You will?

ALABAMA
You better not be fucking teasing me.

CLARENCE
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.

They seal it with a kiss.

LATER √ THAT NIGHT

CLOSEUP √ Alabama's wedding ring.

The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie
they're watching is ""The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the
Flying Guillotine"". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks
down to admre the ring on her hand.

CLARENCE
Did ya ever see ""The Chinese Professionals""?

ALABAMA
I don't believe so.

CLARENCE
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the
Incredible One-Armed Boxer.

We hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:

TV ANNOUNCER
(off)
We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... ""The Incredible One-Armed Boxer
vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine"", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after
these important messages...

Clarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.
We see commercials playing.

He turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.

He smiles and turns back to the TV.

More commercials.

Dolly close on Clarence's face

FLASH ON:

Alabama, right after he proposed.

ALABAMA
You better not be fucking teasing me.

FLASH ON:

In a cute, all-night wedding chapel. Clarence dressed in a rented tuxedo and
Alabama in a rented white wedding gown.

ALABAMA
I do.

CLARENCE
Thank you.

FLASH ON:

Clarence and Alabama, dressed in tux and gown, doing a lover's waltz on a
ballroom dance floor.

FLASH ON:

Clarence and Alabama in a taxi cab.

CLARENCE
Hello, Mrs. Worley.

ALABAMA
How do you do, Mr. Worley?

CLARENCE
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.

ALABAMA
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you
seen your lovely wife today?

CLARENCE
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.

ALABAMA
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?

Moving on top of her.

CLARENCE
Not for me.

He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.

ALABAMA
(playfully)
No no no no no no no no no...

CLARENCE
(playfully)
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...

FLASH ON:

A big mean-looking BLACK MAN in pimp's clothes.

PIMP
Bitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.

Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to
a potential customer.

PIMP
I'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine. This girl's a freak! You can fuck
'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth. Rough stuff, too. She's a freak for it.
Jus' try not to fuck 'er up for life.

FLASH ON:

Pimp beating Alabama.

PIMP
You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn!

FLASH ON:

Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp.

PIMP
Hang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit.

BACK TO:

TV showing kung fu film.

BACK TO:

Clarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes.

Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled
by his sudden movement.

ALABAMA
(yelling after him)
Where you goin', honey?

CLARENCE
(off)
I just gotta get somethin'.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BATHROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep
polluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.

FAMILIAR VOICE
(off)
Well? Can you live with it?

Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.

CLARENCE
What?

ELVIS
Can you live with it?

CLARENCE
Live with what?

ELVIS
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?
And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
You wanna get unhaunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

CLARENCE
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.

ELVIS
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

CLARENCE
You'd really do that?

ELVIS
He don't got no right to live.

CLARENCE
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to
kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.

ELVIS
I don't blame you.

CLARENCE
If I thought I could get away with it √

ELVIS
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya
think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find
who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole
wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught
at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

Clarence looks at Elvis.

ELVIS
Clarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ NIGHT

CLOSEUP √ A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his
heavy athletic sock.

INT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT √ LIVING ROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence returns.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart, write down your former address.

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Write down Drexl's address.

ALABAMA
Why?

CLARENCE
So I can go over there and pick up your things.

ALABAMA
(really scared)
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.

He kneels down before her and holds her hand.

CLARENCE
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.
He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses
absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it
would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?

ALABAMA
You don't know him √

CLARENCE
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I
need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down
the address.

TITLE CARD: ""CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT""

EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET √ NIGHT

It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack
dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his
neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis
Presley gyration.

CLARENCE
(in Elvis voice)
Yeah... Yeah...

He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.

INT. DARK BUILDING √ NIGHT

He's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.

A YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has
really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.

YOUNG BLACK MAN
You want somethin'?

CLARENCE
Drexl?

YOUNG BLACK MAN
Naw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?

CLARENCE
I gotta talk to Drexl.

MARTY
Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him?

CLARENCE
It's about Alabama.

A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our
friend, Drexl Spivey.

DREXL
Where the fuck is that bitch?

CLARENCE
She's with me.

DREXL
Who the fuck are you?

CLARENCE
I'm her husband.

DREXL
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.

INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM √ NIGHT

Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation
they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the
confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.

DREXL
(to Marty)
What was I sayin'?

MARTY
Rock whores.

DREXL
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They
got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.
They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.

Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You know what I'm talkin' about.

Drexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the
apartment.

DREXL
(to Marty)
These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get
the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.

Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-
out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.

DREXL
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with
Cherry Seven-Up.

MARTY
Pussy love pink rocks.

This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he
expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,
demanding Drexl's attention.

DREXL
(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We
got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.

CLARENCE
No thanks.

DREXL
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down
here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to
be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've
already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly
where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some
dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to
myself, ""This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the
world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad
motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my
Chinese, watch my TV."" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV
there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,
and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I
know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.

CLARENCE
I'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.
I'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's ""The
Mack"" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by
Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama
Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In
that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener
pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.
I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that
envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more, not one penny more.

You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full
alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.
Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

DREXL
It's empty.

Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, ""That's right, asshole.""

Silence.

DREXL
Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we
got here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?
Mr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't
got no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand √

Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at
Clarence, catching him of guard.

Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting
him in a tight choke hold.

Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.
We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl
takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.

All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold
records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.

Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.

Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.

Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about
it.

DREXL
Ya wanna fuck with me?
(hits Clarence)
Ya wanna fuck with me?
(hits Clarence)
I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!

He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.

Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs
his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and
starts twisting.

Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip
aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of
his head.

Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's
thumb.

Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and
busting his nose.

Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets
up on his knees.

Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are
going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping
them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other
because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.

Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of
LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to
his feet.

Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.

Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up
into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.

Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.

Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.

DREXL
(to Marty)
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?

MARTY
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk
in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'
smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be
crazy.
(to Marty)
I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.
(laughing)
He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?

MARTY
(laughing)
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a
nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.

CLARENCE
(hurting)
Wannabee nigger...

DREXl
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.

Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.

Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.

Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.

Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.

DREXL
Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost
like a nigger name.
(to Clarence)
Hey, dummy.

He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.

DREXL
Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I
just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're
some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you
are, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,
apartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same
address. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.

He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.

DREXL
(to Marty)
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.
(to Clarence)
You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her
suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's
done it before. But I want you as a audience.
(hollering to Marty)
Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?

MARTY
(off)
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.

DREXL
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there
lately.

While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock
and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's
standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger
and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.

Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.

MARTY
(off)
What's happening?

Marty steps into the room.

Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.

Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other
Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to
be terrified.

Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his
balls and his dick.

Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.

CLARENCE
Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!

She doesn't move.

CLARENCE
You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!

The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the
bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.

Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like
a pillbug.

CLOSEUP √ Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.

Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.

CLARENCE
(to Drexl)
Open you eyes, laughing boy.

He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.

CLARENCE
Open you eyes!

He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.

CLARENCE
You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?

He fires.

CLOSEUP √ The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When
it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ NIGHT

The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and
runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:

CLARENCE
I killed him.

She stops short.

CLARENCE
I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.

Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on
the couch.

Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He
heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.

CLARENCE
Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of
everythin'.

He stops and looks at here.

CLARENCE
I am so hungry.

He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.

ALABAMA
(in a daze)
Was it him or you?

CLARENCE
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there
I said to myself, ""If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it."" I could.
So I did.

ALABAMA
Is this a joke?

CLARENCE
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.

CLARENCE
Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.

She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on
her, yelling:

CLARENCE
Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it
had been me? Do you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?

She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.

ALABAMA
I think what you did was...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
I think what you did...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
... was so romantic.

Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.
Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.

CLARENCE
I gotta get outta these clothes.

He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.

ALABAMA
(comically)
Clean clothes. There is a god,

Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.

ALABAMA
Clarence. Those aren't my clothes.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where
Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CALRENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.

CLOSEUP √ The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of
cocaine!

Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.

Alabama's watching the cable TV.

DICK
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

ALABAMA
This is great, we got cable.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Bama, you got your blade?

Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife
with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the
corkscrew and opens the wine.

He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a
little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.

DICK
This shit can't be real.

CLARENCE
It'll get ya high.

He tosses the knife.

CLARENCE
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

ALABAMA
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.

DICK
It's fuckin' real!
(to Clarence)
It's fuckin' real!

CLARENCE
I certainly hope so.

DICK
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!

CLARENCE
I know.

DICK
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?

CLARENCE
Tell me.

DICK
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!

He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.

DICK
This is Drexl's coke?

CLARENCE
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he
wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama
are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,
you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?

DICK
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.

Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.

CLARENCE
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the
set.

DICK
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know
those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot
to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit
at a time √

CLARENCE
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.

DICK
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?

CLARENCE
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred
thousand. How difficult can that be?

DICK
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat
cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two
hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,
more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could
possibly help you.

CLARENCE
Is he big league?

DICK
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very
powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could
be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.

CLARENCE
What'd'ya tell 'em?

DICK
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and
what wasn't.

CLARENCE
What's this acting class guy's name?

DICK
Elliot.

CLARENCE
Elliot what?

DICK
Elliot Blitzer.

CLARENCE
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the
getting to know you stuff.

DICK
Where?

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
The zoo.

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
The zoo.
(pause)
What are you waiting for?

DICK
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?

CLARENCE
What's to think about?

DICK
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're
married. You killed a guy.

CLARENCE
Two guys.

DICK
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,
Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean
shit.

CLARENCE
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a
fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he
deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit
badge or somethin'.

Dick rests his head in his hands.

CLARENCE
Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need
you to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,
and get your friend to the phone.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth.

Clarence, Alabama, Dick and ELLIOT BLITZER are walking through the zoo.
One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry
boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and
Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.

ELLIOT
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're
unloading √

CLARENCE
Want an animal cracker?

ELLIOT
Yeah, OK.

He takes one.

CLARENCE
Leave the gorillas.

ELLIOT
√ that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars √

CLARENCE
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

DICK
(trying to chill him out)
Clarence...

ELLIOT
Where did you get it?

CLARENCE
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high
enough so you can't see it from the street.

ELLIOT
(forcing a laugh)
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

CLARENCE
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind
of a paste √

ELLIOT
(turning to Dick)
Look, Dick, I don't √

CLARENCE
(laughing)
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you
but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're
good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of
good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

ELLIOT
What department?

CLARENCE
What do you think, eightball?

ELLIOT
The police department?

CLARENCE
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob
questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the
evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with
a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he
could trust.

ELLIOT
He trusts you?

CLARENCE
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So,
I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get
fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you
didn't hear nothin'.

ELLIOT
Sure. I didn't hear anything.

Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when
Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion.
Alabama is forever blowing bubbles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ SNACK BAR √ DAY

We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting
around a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks.
Alabama is still blowing bubbles.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice-cream?

Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean.

ELLIOT
What?

CLARENCE
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice-cream?

ELLIOT
(with conviction)
No. No, you don't.

CLARENCE
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?

DICK
Clarence...

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
Let me handle this.

ELLIOT
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys,
and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're
dependable. And, they're safe.

CLARENCE
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what
the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your
time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's
interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe
fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he
can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's
best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not
puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But,
don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some
guts.

Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement.

INT. PORSCHE √ MOVING √ MULHOLLAND DRIVE √ DAY

Movie producer, LEE DONOWITZ, is driving his Porsche through the winding
Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone
rings, he answers.

LEE
Hello.
(pause)
Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough
of you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always
call me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

Elliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence.
Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles.

ELLIOT
(on phone)
I'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what
I'm talking about, Lee?

BACK TO:

LEE

Store-fronts whiz by in the background.

LEE
Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT
Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you.

BACK TO:

LEE

In the 7th street tunnel. Lee'svoice echoes.

LEE
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT
You said if I didn't get you on the √

Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand.

CLARENCE
(into phone)
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet.

EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.

VIRGIL
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?

FLOYD
Naw, he ain't home right now.

VIRGIL
Do you live here?

FLOYD
Yeah, I live here.

VIRGIL
Sorta room-mates?

FLOYD
Exactly room-mates.

VIRGIL
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours
from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be
travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they
stayin' here?

FLOYD
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're
stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.

VIRGIL
How do you know? You been there?

FLOYD
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda
easy to remember.

VIRGIL
You're right. It is.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ PAYPHONE √ DAY

Clarence is still on the phone with Lee.

CLARENCE
Lee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open ""Doctor Zhivago"" in
L.A. And I want you to distribute it.

BACK TO:

LEE

Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

LEE
I don't know, Clarence, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pretty big movie.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a
lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a
movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.

BACK TO:

LEE

He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.

LEE
I'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all
about. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.
Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end
helps me on many levels.

Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.

LEE
(continuing)
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of
distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna
accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a
risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,
then go straight to cable. This is ""Doctor Zhivago"". This'll be packin' 'em
in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to
work with anybody's movie but mine.

BACK TO:

LEE

Speeding down a benchside road.

LEE
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to ""Doctor Zhivago"" are
in arbitration?

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a
courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on
the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're
in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have
to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.

Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
He wants to talk ya.

ELLIOT
(into phone)
Mr. Donowitz?
(pause)
I told you, through Dick.
(pause)
He's in my acting class.
(pause)
About a year.
(pause)
Yeah, he's good.
(pause)
They grew up together.
(pause)
Sure thing.

Elliot hangs up the phone.

ELLIOT
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants
everybody there.
(pointing to Clarence)
He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do
business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a
sample bag.

CLARENCE
No problems on both counts.

He offers Elliot the animal crackers.

CLARENCE
Have a cookie.

Elliot takes one.

ELLIOT
Thanks.

He puts it in the mouth.

CLARENCE
That wasn't a gorilla, was it?

EXT. HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama
hops out. Clarence stays in.

ALABAMA
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do
my part OK?

CLARENCE
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

ALABAMA
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.

CLARENCE
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.
I'm gonna go grab dinner.

ALABAMA
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm
gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated
movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.

They kiss.

CLARENCE
We now return to ""Bullit"" already in progress.

He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her
little walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she
turns to them.

ALABAMA
Thank you.

She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CALRENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with
a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Step inside and shut the door.

She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Lady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.

VIRGIL
Step away from the door, move into the bathroom.

She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.

VIRGIL
OK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming
back.

ALABAMA
I think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,
but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but
maybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al
Lylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.

Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL
You're cute.

Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square
in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.

CLARENCE
(singing)
""Land of stardust, land of glamour,
Vistavision and Cinema,
Everything about it is a must,
To get to Hollywood, or bust...""

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste
of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil
standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again
to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.

VIRGIL
Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-
degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.
Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get
on your feet, Fruitloop.

Alabama wobbily complies.

VIRGIL
Where's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?

Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to
die, because this man is going to kill her.

ALABAMA
Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.

Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.
The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours
gasping for air that's just not there.

Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.
He takes a long, deep drag.

VIRGIL
Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND √ DAY

Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.

CLARENCE
Woah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest
hamburger you guys got?

The IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:

IRANIAN GUY
That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.

CLARENCE
Well, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two
large Diet Cokes.
(looking at a menu at the wall)
And I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself
against the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.

VIRGIL
You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?
Dream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is
gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my
fuckin' coke?

She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her
head slams into the left side of the wall.

VIRGIL
Where's Clarence?!

Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.
Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her
lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.

VIRGIL
When's Clarence getting back?

She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the
middle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL
You gotta lot of heart, kid.

He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.

Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of
""Newsweek"" with Elvis on the cover.

CLARENCE
That's a great issue.

The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.

CUSTOMER
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.

CLARENCE
Have you read the story on Elvis?

CUSTOMER
No. Not yet.

CLARENCE
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I
look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I
ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever
wrong.

CUSTOMER
That good, huh?

He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the
Elvis article.

CLARENCE
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the
whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew
up with him, the artists he inspired √ Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and
the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the
creeps.

CUSTOMER
I can see what you mean.

CLARENCE
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every
branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.

Clarence and the Customer laugh.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's
crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the
cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.

VIRGIL
Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the
Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles
Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you
green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the
bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the
second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.
You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you
completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the
point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.

He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the
bed, and the black suitcase is right there.

Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the
black case and almost goes snow blind.

VIRGIL
Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.
One less thing I gotta worry about.

Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.

She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.

VIRGIL
OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth √

Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-
man smiles.

VIRGIL
Kid, you got a lotta heart.

He moves toward her.

Alabama's hands are shaking.

VIRGIL
Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only
do that for people I like.

He moves close.

Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.
Buttons fly everywhere.

VIRGIL
Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it.
(giggling)
You don't have anything to lose.

CLOSEUP √ Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.
Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women
that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many
women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt
only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into ""I'll
take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do"" seething hatred.

Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then
drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.

CLOSEUP √ VIRGIL'S FACE

Talk about bloodcurling yells.

Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running
down his face.

While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter
that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,
so it doesn't kill him.

Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.

VIRGIL
OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.

Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it
and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the
nose, breaking it.

Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to
it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,
sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.

Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.
Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but
not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.

VIRGIL
What's so fuckin' funny?!!

ALABAMA
(laughing)
You look so ridiculous.

She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off
the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.

VIRGIL
Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you
laughing now?

Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and
squeezes it out in her hand.

Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.

Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his
eyes.

VIRGIL
Oh Jesus!

She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.

VIRGIL
Oh Mary, help me!

The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's
clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a
Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming
toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks
her into the toilet.

Ahe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the
toilet tank.

Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama
brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet
lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires
anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.

The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.

Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net
hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his
gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,
which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.

He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending
water spraying.

Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama
down, and runs out of the bathroom.

Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off
laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.

Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45
automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.

He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.

Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-
running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.

He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and
sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.

Alabama snatches the shotgun.

Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.

The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second
hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.

Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.

Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been
functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of
Saint Francis of Assisi.

ALABAMA
Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not
so much seek to be consoled as to console;
to be understood as to understand;
to be loved as to love;
for it is in giving that we receive,
it is pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born
to eternal life.

Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,
only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.

CLARENCE
Honey?

She continues. He puts his gun away.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,

She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She
lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.

Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his
shoulder.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

Everybody is outside their rooms wathcing as Clarence walks through the pool
area with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.

EXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's
muttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other
strokes Alabama's hair.

CLARENCE
Sleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than
this. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.

EXT. MOTEL 6 √ NIGHT

A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.

INT. MOTEL 6 √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ NIGHT

Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed.

INT. NOWHERE

Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a
headshot.

CLARENCE
I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the
shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that
the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that
much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.
But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured
with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to √
that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my
hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that
lady again.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS √ NIGHT

A wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance
we hear the roar of a car engine.

EXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE √ NIGHT

Vaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick
corners, pushing it to the edge.

INT. MOVING PORSCHE √ NIGHT

Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is
sitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue
light flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.

ELLIOT
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,
driving like this!
(he pulls over)
Kandi, you gotta help me.

KANDI
What can I do?

He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.

ELLIOT
You gotta hold this for me.

KANDI
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.

ELLIOT
(frantically)
Just put it in your purse.

KANDI
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

ELLIOT
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.

KANDI
No way, Jose.

ELLIOT
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.

KANDI
I'm not wearing a bra.

ELLIOT
(pleading)
Put it in your pants.

KANDI
No.

ELLIOT
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.

KANDI
Read my lips.

She mouths the word ""no"".

ELLIOT
After all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!

She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine
completely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing
beam. Tears fill his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION √ INTERROGATION ROOM √ DAY

Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually
dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.
They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one
is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.

NICHOLSON
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine √

DIMES
Not a tiny little vial √

NICHOLSON
But a fuckin' baggie.

DIMES
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.

NICHOLSON
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now
we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time √

DIMES
You're no longer an extra √

NICHOLSON
Or a bit player √

DIMES
Or a supporting actor √

NICHOLSON
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man
show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience √

DIMES
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy
who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll
have so much experience to draw on √

NICHOLSON
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get
married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because
you'll know what it's like to be a woman.

DIMES
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right
anymore √

NICHOLSON
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.

Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission
accomplished.

INT. POLICE STATION √ CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE √ DAY

CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends
about seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-
nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain.

KRINKLE
Nicholson! Dimes! Het in here!

The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.

NICHOLSON
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin'
into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him
from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form
the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it
was all over √

DIMES
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and
if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole
department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta
come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion √

KRINKLE
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened,
what's going on, and what are you talking about?

DIMES
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for
speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they
bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.

NICHOLSON
Nicholson and I.

DIMES
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in
Denmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're
sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.

NICHOLSON
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.

DIMES
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you
ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT √ DAY

Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. FOUR WISE-GUY HOODS, one older, the
other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.

COCCOTTI
√ And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick
Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never
shows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole
and what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)
You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?

COCCOTTI
It's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But
after that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)
What happened?

OLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)
Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he
served three.

COCCOTTI
Anybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him
personally, he's OK.

BACK TO:

KRINKLE'S OFFICE

NICHOLSON
It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a
million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for
a year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo √

DIMES
Suspect's words √

NICHOLSON
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his
boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

DIMES
He produced ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"".

KRINKLE
That Vietnam movie?

NICHOLSON
Uh-huh.

KRINKLE
That was a good fuckin' movie.

DIMES
Sure was.

KRINKLE
Do you believe him?

NICHOLSON
I believe he believes him.

DIMES
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny
granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.

NICHOLSON
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.

KRINKLE
He'll wear a wire?

DIMES
We talked him into it.

KRINKLE
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.

NICHOLSON
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire
department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the
twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.

DIMES
Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.
And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.

BACK TO:

INT. RESTAURANT √ DAY

YOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)
Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch
off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.

LENNY
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.
(to Marvin)
Do you know Nick Cardella?

MARVIN
No.

LENNY
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?

MARVIN
I didn't mean √

LENNY
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth
before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you
can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.

COCCOTTI
Children, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and
her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find
that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.
So you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who
this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.

TITLE CARD: ""THE BIG DAY""

EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY √ SUNRISE

Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.
As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of
the road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and
enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the LAX Airport runways, where
planes are taking off and landing. A plane takes off, and they stop and watch.

CLARENCE
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.

ALABAMA
Really?

CLARENCE
With a vengeance, I hated them.

ALABAMA
How come?

CLARENCE
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be
surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I
couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough
enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to
an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin'
out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to
do most, but couldn't.

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips.
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

Another plane takes off.

CLARENCE
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new
outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes
out there, and go anywhere we ant.

ALABAMA
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where
we can really start from scatch.

CLARENCE
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in
other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off
to, my little turtledove?

ALABAMA
Cancoon.

CLARENCE
Why Cancoon?

ALABAMA
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. ""Clarence and Alabama Go
to Cancoon"". Don't 'cha think?

CLARENCE
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.

They kiss.

CLARENCE
Don't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve
it.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal.
Floyd lays on the couch watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses because
of the black eye she has.

CLARENCE
(to Floyd)
You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire?

FLOYD
I've partied there twice. Yeah, I'm sure.

DICK
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.
(to Clarence)
Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.

CLARENCE
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.
(pointing to Alabama)
You got yours?

She holds up the suitcase. The phone rings. The three pile out the door. Floyd
picks up the phone.

FLOYD
Hello?

He puts his hand over the receiver.

FLOYD
Dick, it's for you. You here?

DICK
No. I left.

He starts to close the door then opens it again.

DICK
I'll take it.
(he takes the receiver)
Hello.
(pause)
Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out the √
(pause)
Really?
(pause)
I don't believe it.
(pause)
She really said that?
(pause)
I'll be by first thing.
(pause)
No, thank you for sending me out.
(pause)
Bye-bye.

He hangs up and looks to Clarence.

DICK
(stunned)
I got the part on ""T.J. Hooker"".

CLARENCE
No shit? Dick, that's great!

Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles.

DICK
(still stunned)
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and
Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for
seven o'clock in the morning.

CLARENCE
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.

Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go.

DICK
Clarence.

CLARENCE
Yeah?

DICK
Um, nothing, let's go?

They exit.

EXT. LAX AIRPORT √ HOTEL √ DAY

We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape.

INT. LAX AIRPORT √ HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is sitting on a bed.

Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun. He goes over to Lenny and gives
him some shells.

Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun.

The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a
couple of .45 automatics in his hands.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ COP S' HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Nicholson and Dimes and FOUR DETECTIVES from internal affairs are in a
room on the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire on Elliot.

NICHOLSON
OK, say something.

ELLIOT
(talking loud into the wire)
Hello! Hello! Hello! How now brown cow!

DIMES
Just talk regular.

ELLIOT
(normal tone)
""But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief √""

NICHOLSON
Are you gettin' this shit?

DETECTIVE BY TAPE MACHINE
Clear as a bell.

Nicholson, Dime, and the head IA Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot.

DIMES
Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall.

ELLIOT
And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in.

NICHOLSON
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta
put your boss in jail.

DIMES
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an
important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.

NICHOLSON
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.

WURLITZER
And this fellow Clarence?

ELLIOT
Yeah, Clarence.

WURLITZER
You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this.

ELLIOT
I'll try.

DIMES
You do more than try.

NICHOLSON
You do.

DIMES
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route.

DICK
You got that playing basketball?

ALABAMA
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled
the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.

They stop at a red light. Clarence looks at Alabama.

CLARENCE
Red light means love, baby.

Ha and Alabama start kissing.

INT. MOVING CADILLAC √ DAY

Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE PARKING LOT √ DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang. Dick takes the
suitcase.

CLARENCE
I'll take that. Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking.

Clarence takes out his .38. Dick reacts. They walk and talk.

DICK
What the fuck did you bring that for.

CLARENCE
In case.

DICK
In case of what?

CLARENCE
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?

DICK
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp √

CLARENCE
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week
has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a
gun and not to have it.

Pause. Clarence stops walking.

CLARENCE
Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.
What say we forget the whole thing.

Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.

DICK
Do you really mean it?

CLARENCE
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think
about it. How 'bout you, Bama?

ALABAMA
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.

CLARENCE
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't
want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up
there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's
waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the
downside.

DICK
Now's a helluva time to play ""what if"".

CLARENCE
This is our last chance to play ""what if"". I want to do it. I'm just scared of
getting caught.

ALABAMA
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.

CLARENCE
That rhymes.

He kisses her.

DICK
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta
here.

CLARENCE
Yeah, let's just get outta here.

The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two
climb in. Clarence hops back out.

CLARENCE
I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.
I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in
there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,
he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man
who can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let
the chips fall where they may.

Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and
Alabama exchange looks and follow.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ LOBBY √ DAY

Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself.

ELLIOT
(singing)
There's a man who leads a life of danger,
To everyone he meets
he stays a stranger.
Be careful what you say,
you'll give yourself away...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ COPS' HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape
machine. Coming from the machine:

ELLIOT'S VOICE
(off)
... odds are you won't live
to see tomorrow,
secret agent man,
secret agent man....

Nicholson looks at Dimes.

NICHOLSON
Why, all of the sudden, have I got a bad feeling?

BACK TO:

LOBBY

Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase. He spots Elliot and
goes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself,
quietly:

ELLIOT
Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.

Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.

ELLIOT
Where's everybody else?

CLARENCE
They'll be along.

Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot.

ELLIOT
Hi, Dick.

DICK
How you doin', Elliot?

CLARENCE
Well, I guess it's about that time.

ELLIOT
I guess so. Follow me.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ELEVATOR √ DAY

The four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the
car to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing. They are all silent.

CLARENCE
Elliot.

ELLIOT
Yeah?

CLARENCE
Get on your knees.

Not sure he heard him right.

ELLIOT
What?

Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his .38.

CLARENCE
I said get on your fuckin' knees.

Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react.

CLARENCE
Shut up, both of you, I know what I'm doin'.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Pandemonium.

DIMES
He knows.

NICHOLSON
How the fuck could he know?

DIMES
He saw the wire.

NICHOLSON
How's he supposed to see the wire?

DIMES
He knows something's up.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts the .38 against Elliot's forehead.

CLARENCE
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?

No answer.

CLARENCE
Don't you?

ELLIOT
(petrified)
No.

CLARENCE
(yelling)
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest
motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a
doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

DIMES
We gotta get him outta there.

NICHOLSON
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE
Say it, goddamn it!

ELLIOT
You are the dumbest person in the world.

CLARENCE
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.

ELLIOT
No. No you're not.

CLARENCE
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.

BACK TO:

COPS

NICHOLSON
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the
show must go on.

DIMES
This guy's gonna kill him.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE
Stand up.

Elliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.

CLARENCE
Like Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell
me what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If
anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the
first one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit
making me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
He's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.

DIMES
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.

NICHOLSON
You're am actor, so act, motherfucker.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Elliot still hasn't answered.

CLARENCE
OK.

With the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the
gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what
he's gonna do.

Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the
other end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.

ELLIOT
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come
and get me cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be.
And I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come
and get me. Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but
I just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything
would be alright.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a ""well, that's that""
expression an their faces.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.

CLARENCE
Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal. I just hadda make sure you're all right. I'm
sure. I really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, I'm just as
scared as you. Friends?

Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand. Dick and Alabama are
relieved.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Floyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw
him.

There is a knock from the door.

FLOYD
(not turning away from TV)
It's open.

The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The
door slams shut. All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd.

FLOYD
Yes.

LENNY
Are you Dick Ritchie?

FLOYD
No.

LENNY
Do you know a Clarence Worley?

FLOYD
Yes.

LENNY
Do you know where we can find him?

FLOYD
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

LENNY
Where's that?

FLOYD
Well, you go down Beechwood...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

The door opens and reveals an EXTREMELY MUSCULAR GUY with an Uzi
strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty.

MONTY
Hi, Elliot. Are these your friends?

ELLIOT
You could say that. Everybody, this is Monty.

MONTY
C'mon in. Lee's in the can. He'll be out in a quick.

They all move into the room, it is very luxurious.

ANOTHER INCREDIBLY MUSCULAR GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he
too has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down.

MONTY
Sorry, nothin personal.

He starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away.

CLARENCE
No need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre.

Boris gets up from the couch.

BORIS
What compelled you to bring that along?

CLARENCE
The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire
weaponry to a business meeting.

BORIS
I'll take that.

CLARENCE
You'll have to.

The toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz
emerges.

LEE
They're here. Who's who?

ELLIOT
Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and
Alabama.

BORIS
(pointing at Clarence)
This guy's packin'.

LEE
Really?

CLARENCE
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these ""Soldier of
Fortune"" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident
that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll
put the gun on the table.

LEE
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you
be nice and get coffee for everybody.

They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee,
and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.

CLARENCE
Oh, Mr. Donowitz √

LEE
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.

CLARENCE
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"" is one
of my favorite movies. After ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it's the best
Vietnam movie ever.

LEE
Thank you very much, Clarence.

CLARENCE
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. ""Sophie's
Choice"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Gandhi"". All that
stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

LEE
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

CLARENCE
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are
unwatchable movies from unreadable books.

Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills
everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.

LEE
Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more
than I do, but I wouldn't count on it.

Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.

CLARENCE
They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.
And do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like
movies. ""Mad Max"", that's a movie. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"",
that's a movie. ""Rio Bravo"", that's a movie. ""Rumble Fish"", that's a
fuckin' movie. And, ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"", that's a movie. It was
the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the ""The Deer
Hunter"".

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They're all listening to this.

DIMES
What's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the ""New
Yorker""?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE
My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw ""Coming
Home in a Body Bag"" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film
they'd ever seen.

LEE
You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it
makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you
my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you
have for me.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
Thank God.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Clarence puts the suitcase on the table.

CLARENCE
Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit.

BACK TO:

LOBBY

The four Wise-guys are at the desk.

LENNY
(quietly to the others)
What was the Jew-boy's name?

MARVIN
Donowitz, he said.

FRONT-DESK GUY
How can I help you, Gentlemen?

LENNY
Yeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.

CLARENCE
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot
more.

LEE
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.

CLARENCE
Me too, Boris.

Boris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.
All eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this
cup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.

LEE
(stirring loudly)
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?

CLARENCE
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

Both are cool as cucumbers.

LEE
I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris
make anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in
there.

ALABAMA
No thank you.

DICK
No. But thanks.

CLARENCE
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that
made me a little sick.

LEE
Where'd you go?

CLARENCE
A Norms in Van Nuys.

LEE
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.

Lee continues looking at the merchandise.

Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin
over to Clarence. It says: ""You're so cool"" with a tiny heart drawn on the
bottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.
She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.

Lee looks up.

LEE
OK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal
that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the
level.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.

DIMES
Convince him.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE
Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I
don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with
professionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,
and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a
helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug
dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all
of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and
you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like
you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,
only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I
can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a
couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money
to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred
thousand is the world.

LEE
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.

CLARENCE
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.
(to Elliot)
Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on
you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.
(to Lee)
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.

LEE
Why does he trust you?

CLARENCE
We grew up together.

LEE
If you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?

CLARENCE
I bullshitted him.

Lee starts laughing.

LEE
That's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other
room and get the money.

Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks.

DIMES & NICHOLSON
Bingo!

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

The four Wise-guys are coming up.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

LEE
(pointing to Alabama)
What's your part in this?

ALABAMA
I'm his wife.

LEE
(referring to Dick)
How 'bout you?

DICK
I know Elliot.

LEE
And Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend
work in?

Dick and Alabama panic.

CLARENCE
(without missing a beat)
Carson County Sheriffs.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

The internal affairs officers high five.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.

LEE
Wanna count your money?

CLARENCE
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They all stand.

DIMES
OK, boys. Let's go get 'em.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ LEE'S HOTEL ROOM √ BATHROOM √
DAY

Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he
starts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet
and starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.

ELVIS
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.

CLARENCE
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.

ELVIS
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.

CLARENCE
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.

ELVIS
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: ""I'll take that gun"", ""You'll
have to"".

CLARENCE
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came
from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,
that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Everything's just as it was.

Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with
guns drawn.

DIMES & NICHOLSON
Police! Freeze, you're all under arrest!

Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.

NICHOLSON
You two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.

MONTY
Fuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.

LEE
Monty, what are you talking about? So what they say.

DIMES
This is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!

BORIS
This is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!
Now get on the floor!

DICK
What the fuck am I doing here?

LEE
Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!

MONTY
So they're cops. Who gives a shit?

BORIS
Lee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.

DIMES
OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't
want it, and you don't want it.

LEE
We don't want it.

The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,
who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.

Half of the cops spin around.

WURLITZER
Freeze!

LENNY
Who are you guys?

WURLITZER
Police.

DARIO
(to Lenny)
Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops?

BACK TO:

BATHROOM

Clarence and Elvis.

CLARENCE
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?

ELVIS
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

CLARENCE
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

ELVIS
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as
kissin' his ass.

CLARENCE
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"".

ELVIS
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and
he can see that.

Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.

ELVIS
I like ya, Clarence. Always have.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with
shotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns
in the middle.

Dick's ready to pass out.

Alabama's so scared she pees on herself.

For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.

ELLIOT
Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes.

Dimes looks at Elliot.

ELLIOT
This has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just
settle it by yourselves?

DIMES
Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!

LEE
(to Elliot)
How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,
you fuckin' little piece of shit!

ELLIOT
Lee, understand, I didn't want to √

NICHOLSON
Shut the fuck up!

LEE
Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty
years cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you
SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the
heart!

Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and
flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,

Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.

Alabama screams.

Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.

DIMES
(screaming)
Cody!!!

Nicholson flies backwards.

Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks
back and forth then on the floor.

Clarence opens the bathroom door.

Dimes hits the ground firing.

A shot catches Clarence in the forehead.

Alabama screams.

Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the
bathroom sink, smashing the mirror.

It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either
hits the ground or runs for cover.

Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.

Boris dives into the kitchen area.

Monty tips the table over.

Marvin dives behind the sofa.

Dario runs out of the door and down the hall.

With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA
Officers are shot right away.

Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.

Elliot gets it from both sides.

Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the
bathroom.

Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.

Alabama continues crawling.

Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast
hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.

The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.

As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over
the apartment.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ DAY

Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.

BACK TO:

GUNFIGHT

Alabama crawling.

The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.
Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.
White powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.

Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.

An IA Officer goes after him.

Lenny makes a break for it.

Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.

Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.

ALABAMA
Sweety?

Clarence's face is awash with blood.

CLARENCE
I... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...

He dies.

Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ HALLWAY √ DAY

Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.

He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ANOTHER HALLWAY

The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes
around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the
same corner.

IA OFFICER
(aiming gun)
Freeze!

Dick does.

DICK
I'm unarmed!

IA OFFICER
Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!

He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,
sending him to the wall.

DICK
Oh shit.

He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the
corner and runs down the hall.

Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.

Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.

DICK
Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm
sorry.

Two elevator doors on either side of them open.

Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:

LENNY
Lotsa luck.

Lenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors
close.

BACK TO:

HOTEL ROOM

The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each
other down.

Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned
down in the kitchen.

In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get
his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of
times.

ALABAMA
Wake up, goddamn it!

Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the
grip of a dead Wise-guy.

Boris peeks around the wall to fire.

Dimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.

BORIS
(off)
I'm shot! Stop!

DIMES
Throw out your gun, asshole!

The Uzi's tossed out.

Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.

DIMES
(to Marvin)
OK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down
on the floor or die like all you friends.

The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ELEVATOR √ DAY

Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the
fourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.

HALLWAY

He starts trying the room doors for an open one.

DICK
Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up
again. Please, just let me get to ""T.J. Hooker"" on Monday.

STEWARDESS'S ROOM √ DAY

Dick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout
to a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't
hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.

LEE'S ROOM

Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen
floor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.

DIMES
Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.

Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.

Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.

Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying
over him.

Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer.

DIMES
Everything's under control here.

WURLITZER
Sorry about Nicholson.

DIMES
Me too.

WURLITZER
I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.

DIMES
You do that.

Wurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.

LOBBY

Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.

A COP yells out.

COP
You! Stop!

Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush
forward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.

LENNY
Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!

LEE'S ROOM

Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the
floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.
Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She
reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her
hand and remembers Clarence saying:

CLARENCE
(off)
She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She
carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,
and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.

Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.

Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She
fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.

She sees Boris on the kitchen floor.

ALABAMA
Bye-bye, Boris. Good luck.

BORIS
You too, cutie.

She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and
walks out the door.

HALLWAY

The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.

Alabama comes around the corner.

WURLITZER
Hey, you!

Alabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the
doors close.

LOBBY

Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS
are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.

LENNY
I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to
take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!
(pause)
Small bills!

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ PARKING LOT √ DAY

Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives
away.

INT. MUSTANG √ MOVING √ DAY

Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be
funny. She's muttering to herself.

ALABAMA
I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked
away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred
percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I
should laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy
like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're
a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?
Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got
me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.
Goose egg. Nil. Donut.

The song ""Little Arrows"" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks
down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.
She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on
the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.

She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view
mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens
on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads
it: ""You're so cool"".

She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She
looks around for, and finally finds, the ""Sgt. Fury"" comic book Clarence bought
her.

And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away
from the Mustang forever.

Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like all we do is fight
Every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again
Do it over, can we straighten it out
Can we work it out, cuz...

I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you

I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you

How can this be (that it's not workin out)
That it's not workin out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me that we don't talk no more
It's not supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes, but gotta carry on

87,2000,Yankee Grey,Another Nine Minutes,"6:30 in the morning
I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes
I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late

(Another nine minutes) Don't worry about the clock

The way they truly feel
I would die for you gladly

91,2000,Martina McBride,Love's The Only House,"[Verse 1]
I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way
All I could say was

[Chorus]
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house
Big enough for all the pain

[Verse 2]
He was walking by the other day and I said
Hey baby, how you've been
Yeah I got me a little girl now and she's 4 years old
And she's got her daddy's little grin
And you only wanted what you can't have
And baby you can't have me now
I gave my heart to another
Yeah I'm a mother and he's a father and we're a family and we got each other
And I found out the hard way that
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

[Verse 4]
Somewhere 'cross the parking lot some bands playing out of tune
City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day
Don Juan left got sick of trying
No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money
I said hey I'll cover you honey
Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace
So come on down to my house
Don't you know that

92,2000,Pearl Jam,Nothing As It Seems,"[Verse 1]
Don't feel like home
Ease a little out
And all these words alone is nothing like your poem
Putting in and putting in
Don't feel like methadone
A scratching voice all alone is nothing like your baritone

[Chorus]
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

[Verse 2]
One uninvited chromosome
A blanket like the ozone

[Chorus]
It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes
[Verse 3]
Saving up a sunny day
Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding?
Rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

[Chorus]
It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

[Chorus]
And all that he frees
A little bittersweet
It's home
It's nothing as it seems
The little that you see it's home"

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
[Chorus]
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

[Verse 4]
Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...
[Chorus]
Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl
Hey

Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there

Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned

Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
""I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there""
[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's

Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Verse 2: Nelly]
Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon
[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?

I know something you don't know
And I've got something to tell ya

But now the same motherfuckers asking me for dough
And I'm yelling: ""I can't help ya""
""But Nelly can we get tickets to the next show?""
Hell no (what's witchyou?!) you for real?!

But yo, it's all good, Range Rover all wood
Do me like you should, fuck me good, suck me good
We be them stud niggas, ""wishing you was"" niggas
Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking
Honey in the club, me in the Benz
Icy grip, telling me to leave with you and your friends
So if shorty wanna... knock, we knocking to this
And if shorty wanna... rock, we rocking to this
And if shorty wanna... pop, we popping the Crist'
Shorty wanna see the ice, then I ice the wrist
City talk, Nelly listen; Nelly talk, city listen
When I fuck fly bitches; when I walk pay attention

108,2001,Dido,Thank You,"[Verse 1]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Verse 2]
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad

[Chorus]
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
[Verse 3]
Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

[Chorus]
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life
And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life

111,2001,Train,Drops Of Jupiter (Tell Me),"[Verse 1]
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
Hey, hey-yeah

[Chorus]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

[Bridge]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

[Breakdown]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself?

Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

And did you fall from a shooting star?
Fall from a shooting star?

112,2001,City High,What Would You Do?,"[Verse 1: Robby]
Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers tryna work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

[Chorus: Claudette & Robby]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Mmm

[Verse 2: Ryan Toby]
Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die
She said, ""[Nigga], I know about pain 'cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more [shit] that you can't even relate to""

What would you do if your son was at home (Oh)
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor (Woahh, woah)
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money (Yeah, woah)
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life
Mmm (Yeah)

Yo, wait, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, stop the record, yo
Stop the record
You should you ain't gonna be going out
Like this man

Hold up!

Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
(What would you do?)
'Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
(Come on, what would you do?)
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
(What would you do?)
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby, you can do it

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor (Crying all alone, yeah)
'Cause he's hungry?

Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

They wanna bank up, crank up, makes me dizzy
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

[Verse 2: Eve]
Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind
[Verse 3: Eve]
Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year

Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play (Just play my song)
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

[Chorus]
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn it on
DJ, just play that song
'Cause I wanna be dancing (DJ) all night long
Play my, play my, play my, play my
Play my favorite song (Uh)

[Verse 2]
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up 'cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong (Can't be wrong)
I get chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops, better press rewind (Play that shit again)
Let me hear it one more time
[Chorus]
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long (You know this song)
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up, and turn it on (One more time)
Play, come on, DJ, play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ, just play that song)
'Cause I wanna be dancing all night long

[Bridge]
I just wanna dance, is that a crime?
Alright then
Ooh, uh
Oh (Alright)

Play, come on play that song (Now, Mr. DJ)
Play it all night long (I've asked you three times already)

Sometimes I feel the fear of uncertainty stinging clear
And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's driven me before
And it seems to have a vague, haunting mass appeal
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that I should be the one behind the wheel

[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Verse 2]
So if I decide to waiver my chance
To be one of the hive
Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?
Oh
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's driven me before
And it seems to be the way, that everyone else gets around
But lately I'm
Beginning to find that when I drive myself, my light is found
[Chorus]
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Would you choose water over wine?
Hold the wheel and drive

Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
With open arms and open eyes, yeah
Whatever tomorrow brings I’ll be there
I’ll be there

How can I be so damn demanding?

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion
And I can't get enough

[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery
Why I surrender
Girl, you got everything
[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl, the list goes on and on and on

That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me (Something for me)
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive
The way you talk, the way you tease

In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 2]
To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice
[Verse 3]
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice

Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love"
126,2001,Tim McGraw,Grown Men Don't Cry,"[Verse 1]
I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

[Chorus]
But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

[Verse 2]
Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

[Chorus]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry
[Verse 3]
I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

[Chorus x2]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry"
127,2001,Lee Ann Womack,I Hope You Dance,"[Verse 1]
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

[Verse 2]
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 3]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

[Verse 4]
Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[Chorus]
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

[Bridge:]
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance
I hope you dance
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

Girl: Peace!

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So If you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

See I

What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before

""Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think""

130,2001,Madonna,What It Feels Like For A Girl,"[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

[Outro: Madonna]
For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?"

You know
I don't know what it is (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But everything about you is so irresistible

[Verse 1]
Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire (With desire)
I know that I'm supposed to make him wait
Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire
I know I meant to say no

Don't you think I'm trying to tell my heart what's right?
That I should really say goodnight
But I just can't stop myself from falling (Falling)
Maybe I'll tell him that I feel the same
(That I don't wanna) That I don't wanna play no game (No)
'Cause when I feel his arms wrapped around me
I know I meant to say no (I meant to say no)

What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See, Jacob's and frost your wrist up

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

Since we met, it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry

'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours

If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby

He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

[Chorus 1]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

[Verse 2]
She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes
[Chorus 2]
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

Take a look around

Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Verse 2]
Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your Presence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions
[Chorus]
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Bridge]
At first you didn't mean that much to me, no
But now I know you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you, yeah
And everything that I do, I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true

[Chorus]
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

She stole your heart
Only did it because she could
Chewed you up and spat you out
That girl never was no good (no good)
Baby I will never do that
I'll love you faithfully

Making you a wreck
Making you follow me

She and I are nothing alike
You're confusing day with night
That was then, this is now
You wanna trust me, but you don't know how

Set you down, can't you see
That was her (that was her)
And baby this is me (this is me)

139,2001,Travis Tritt,It's A Great Day To Be Alive,"[Verse 1]
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright
[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

[Verse 2]
And it's been awhile since I could say that I wasn't addicted and
It's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

[Bridge]
Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
[Verse 3]
And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her

When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I love my life, I love my wife, a bad time to prevail
It overwhelmed me, I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martin, let's get the party
Cracking right here, fuck V.I.P. 
Knowing my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she just surprised that we
Been together for this long and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

From what I recall, we was little niggas
Cuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches
Livin' life so free, that we ain't fearin' the
Ills of the world and the heat of drug dealin'
You and I then made a killin', and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why
All my good niggas gotta die?
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

Wash away your tears, my love
You ain't gotta cry no more, my love
I put it on everything that I love
That my pain is my love
[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
And I want this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear, 'cause a nigga died happily
My mama warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me, tears in her eyes
And they be saying shit like, ""I don't want me baby to die""
Brought so much pain to her life, gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
Ooh, you cry, then I cry, then we cry
When he cries, I cry, together, together
When I cry, then you cry, then we'll cry together
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, baby
'Cause when Ja cries, Mo cries, we'll cry together
If he cry, then I'll cry, then we'll cry together, yeah

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

I feel stupid
But I know it won't last for long
And I've been guessing
And I could have been guessing wrong
You don't know me now
I kinda thought that you should some how
Does that whole mad season got you down?

[Verse 2]
Well I feel stupid
But it's something that comes and goes
And I've been changing
I think it's funny how no one knows
We don't talk about
The little things that we do without
When that whole mad season comes around

[Pre-Chorus]
So, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?
It seems to me you'll come around

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season
[Verse 3]
I feel stupid
But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know I still turn you on
You've grown colder now
Torn apart, angry, turned around
What that whole mad season knock you down?

[Pre-Chorus]
So are you gonna stand there, are you gonna help me out?
We need to be together now

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season

[Bridge]
And now I'm crying, isn't that what you want?
And I'm trying to live my life on my own, but I won't, no
At times I do believe I am strong
So someone tell me why, why, why
Do I, I, I
Feel stupid
And I come undone
Well I come undone
[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken

[Chorus]
Well I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, I'm a child and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come, oh, I come undone, in this mad season

[Outro]
In this mad season
It's been a mad season
Been a mad season"
151,2001,George Strait,If You Can Do Anything Else,"[Verse 1]
Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Verse 2]
There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here
[Bridge]
This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Outro]
Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Oh, baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else)"
152,2001,Aerosmith,Jaded,"[Verse 1]
Hey, j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

[Verse 2]
Hey j-j-jaded, in all it's misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you
[Verse 3]
Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Hey, j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby, please
When I'm shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
I'ma talking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
(Baby)
Jaded
(Baby)
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you"
153,2001,Montgomery Gentry,She Couldn't Change Me,"Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be
Yeah, she changed her mind when she couldn't change me"

Was it the pull of the moon now baby
That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy

I've never felt the Earth move honey
Until you shook my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on

Do you mind if I tell the truth for a second, yall?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I deserve..
To wonder who's calling so damn late
For you to say I'm tripping, just a homie from upstate
(said it's just a homie)
Don't he know its one o' clock in the mornin'
You say baby its cool (baby its cool)
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say he's comin' into town (later on this evenin')
You was just wondering if you and him can hang out
I don't like it, but I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool cause I know it's true

[Hook (x2)]
Maybe I deserve..
For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve..
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve..
For you to do all the things I did to you
Maybe I deserve..
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Maybe I deserve..
[Verse 2]
Maybe I deserve..
For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you ""who the hell you tryna impress?""
(""Who the hell you tryna impress?"")
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothin'
I know its somethin'
(maybe, just maybe)
Maybe I deserve..
To sit at home and wonder where you are
Is he kissin' you, touchin' you, holdin' you, what?
To take a drink to help ease my mind
I wanna be mad (wanna be)
After all those times (after all those times)

For me to ask you ""where you've been?""
(""Where the hell you've been?"")
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say ""I better stop trippin'""
Maybe I deserve..
To grab your neck until you let me know
Maybe I deserve..
For you to run cryin', cryin' out the door
Maybe I deserve..
To grab my coat, and chase you down the street
Maybe I deserve..
To say its not you, it's my own insecurities
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say ""yes I cheated on you""
(""Yes I cheated on you"")
Maybe I deserve..
And I won't care cause after all I put you through

[Outro]
Maybe I deserve-serve...yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
Maybe I deserve..
To even be, lied to sometimes..
Maybe, maybe you should go cheat on me too"

And when you go, go, go, go
I know, it never ends, never ends

[Chorus]
All the things that I used to say

159,2001,O-Town,All Or Nothing,"[Verse 1]
I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

[Verse 2]
There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing

[Bridge]
'Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

[Chorus]
Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all
Or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

160,2001,Toya,I Do!!,"[Verse 1:]
He was a six foot stallion
Said a storybook thug
He was the kind
That made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop pulpitating
Every time he came near
He has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin
He was plaided
And his head was cornrows
He has his wrists bling-blinging
And his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go

[Chorus x2:]
I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out playa
Balling out of control

[Verse 2:]
Me and my crew started grooving
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show
I shook my hips
Took a dip
Roll my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance wit me
I felt fingertips on the small of my back
So I had to react like I was playing hard to get
And told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you
Fa 'sho
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge x2:]
Watch me
Drop, drop
Shake it
For the fellas who know
Watch me pop
Pop my hips
As I dip and roll
Watch me stop
Stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowing all the papi's want me
But all I want is you

When your heart is all alone every second
Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue

[Chorus]
But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you
The way I love you

When it's late, the sun hangs low
By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

So let's put aside our foolish pride
And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own

Oh, oh
Won't get me back, no

So now you wanna talk
Say let's do it just once more for luck
Like old times make up
Better yet, just forget
Better get over yourself
Stay in touch

About love (tell me baby)
Until then wake up
Better yet, better get
Better get over yourself

Get over yourself, goodbye

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes ""you'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh (Oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Hit 'em up style)
Get your hands on his cash and (Oh yeah)
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Oh-oh-oh)
Hey ladies (Hey ladies, hey ladies, hey ladies, yeah)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh no, oh no, yeah, oh oh oh
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Hit 'em up, yeah)
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild (Buck wild)
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Oh)
Get your hands on his cash and (Da da dum, da da dum)
Oh, when you go then everything goes (Everything goes)
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up"

Better move, 'cause we've arrived

You gotta do much better

Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

166,2001,Brad Paisley,Two People Fell In Love,"[Verse 1]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[Chorus]
There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love
[Verse 2]
Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[Chorus]

[Tag]
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

[Outro]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon"

Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us

Everybody believed we would never be
Look at us up above, we are so in love
Everyday in your arms, baby, can't go wrong
We are strong, look at us now

A bird up in the sky, our love will not deny
We'll make it baby, look at us now

In all you ever do, I know you will be true
Look at us baby, look at us now
The story of our kind is one to never die
We'll make it baby, look at us now
Baby look at us"
168,2001,Craig David,Fill Me In,"[Intro]
I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

[Chorus]
""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
169,2001,2Pac,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time"
170,2001,Mark McGuinn,Mrs. Steven Rudy,"I get up on Sunday, about eight-fifteen
Just to get the paper that I never read
'Cause I know she'll be there barely in her robe
Sittin' on her front porch paintin' on her toes
Her husband's always on the road

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Sometimes Mrs. Rudy calls cryin' late at night
'Cause her and Mr. Ugly have had another fight
We talk a while, and I hear her smile
When she says thank you, I tell her that she's welcome
Like any friend would do
I only wish she knew

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you
Imagination, infatuation
I'm what she deserves
I wonder if she thinks about me
The way I think about her

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you

And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Oh Mrs. Rudy
That wedding ring is as ugly to me
As your husband is to you

Did you sleep on the wrong side, I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious, what's the latest?
Speak your heart, don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted (Yeah), don't misuse it
What's your problem, let's resolve it
We can solve it, what's the causes?
It's official, you got issues
I got issues (Um, well you got issues), but I know I miss you

Who should be hurt, will we remain? Oh, I
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I wanna know, where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I wanna know, were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know I wouldn't have put on my clothes
(I wanna know) Where'd you go instead?
It was four in the morning when you crept back in the bed
I wanna know, what was in your head?
Or what was in my head, am I supposed to change?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Oh, who should be hurt, who should be blamed?
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Who should be hurt, who should be ashamed?
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Oh, who should be hurt and will we remain?
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion

Who should be hurt and who should be blamed?

You'll let me know, you'll let me know

[Verse 3: Timbaland]
Girl, holla
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season
Maybe the month, maybe you're bleeding
Now tell me what's the reason?
Snoop video? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying, cut the coughing, cut the wheezing, girl
Quit the blaming, cut the naming, cut the sneaking, girl
I think you need some prayer, better call a deacon, girl
So get your act right or else we won't be speaking, girl
So what's it gonna be?
Freaky-freaky, me and you?
Or is it gonna be, who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow, ooh"
172,2001,Jessica Andrews,Who I Am,"If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
And when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine
Cause nothing changes who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I'm a saint
And I'm a sinner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young
But I am able

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter

Someday you'll see things my way
'Cause you never know, no, you never know

175,2001,Faith Evans Featuring Carl Thomas,Can't Believe,"[Verse 1]
[Carl Thomas]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes, I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more
(Never imagined...)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (so emotional)

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases no more, no more
[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

[Bridge: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes, you did)
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness (unhappiness)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
(no more baby, baby, please)
I'm emotional (you threw it all away)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
(just a faded picture, faded picture) (gotta leave you, baby)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (baby, could you hear me, oh)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (never imagined, oh)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

[Outro: Carl Thomas]
Yes, I'm looking at the front door, baby, whoa
So, so, so very emotional
Baby, I'm emotional"

Mmm, mmm, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows, I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 2]
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah (Haha)
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see (Yeah)

[Verse 3]
Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?
My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now don't be offended, this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself (Go on and love yourself, go on and love yourself)
‘Cause everything's gonna be alright
[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Yeah)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 4]
Uh, keep your fancy drinks, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All I need is my guitar
Keep your Cristal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own
What God gave me is just fine (Oh)

[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be

I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)

178,2001,Dave Matthews Band,The Space Between,"[Verse 1]
You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you, for me
No corner you could squeeze me?
But I got all the time for you, love

[Hook]
The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Verse 2]
But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

[Hook 2]
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain
[Breakdown]
Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

[Hook 3]
The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mind
Is a space we'll fill with time
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain
The space between
The space between"
179,2001,"Three The... G. Dep, P. Diddy & Black Rob",Let's Get It,"[Round 1: Charlie Clips]
How the fuck is my swag off, fag sauce?
When you called Rich Dolarz handsome twice?
And was the only one who knew he played football his the pads off
That means you'll go to a Lions game in a Viking helmet
Wearing Jacksonville Jag draws and buy Old Navy shirts
And call Calicoe over like, ""Rip the tags off.""
You the 4th dirtiest nigga in battling, {points to Calicoe}
You 3rd
But got the nerve to tell niggas they swag off
And it's been 5 battles straight and you have yet to take that hat off
Now either Blind Fury is your barber, he zipped you and took the back off
Or you have a hairline that'll make Lebron happy but piss Smack off
You know what, fuck the jokes, I ain't got time for all the extra kidding
So I don't wanna hear how you been hard
Which one of y'all niggas got his SIM card?
Cause his texts/Tec's is missing, not mine
I got Mobs, throw that extra clip in
You'll get Roc'd cause I let my K-Shine without Rex permission
Aye Mook! He wanna be a Ruff Ryder
Y'all should let this bitch take Eve's spot
Knock his wig off, he'll get the same scalp Jada' and Styles P got
I show up in Detroit with a gun that's big enough to take Sheek's spot
So when it's shooting you better tell everybody in the D-Block
Before I kill you with more lines like that, it's some real shit I gotta address
X-Factor, the new old nigga, I'm sorry y'all but I'm not all that impressed
Cause in order to be a champion you gotta defeat a champion
Be ready to give and take a beat down
And under no circumstance do you get scared
And demand to go under three rounds
Smack and Beasley called your phone, am I lying?
And you was like, ""I mean, I mean, I mean
I'm not fearing shit, a fat bitch bungee cord snapped on Richie
So I'm not scared and shit
But it's just, it's Charlie Clips we're talking about
And I need a whole lot of time to prepare and shit.""
You bitch ass nigga, you gotta be ready to give and take that contact
Smack and Beasley should have a meeting and then jump you
Cause going 3 rounds was in our contract
But you begged to go one
And then you asked if I can only rap for five minutes
My reply, ""Five minutes? Suck my dick! I rap until I'm finished!""
They paid $100 per ticket, plus tax, everybody in here gotta be hating you
But this ain't the first time you did some sucka shit X
I been seen the fake in you
DNA said let's battle, you said ""no""
Then when 2 weeks left you said, ""I'm taking you.""
You made your 3 rounds, yeah, and you accepted the challenge
I see the snake in you
DNA only had two weeks to prepare
You had a whole month, he was flaming you
Cause you had to get the priorities theme
From Quest McCody to even make it debatable
You know how many niggas wanna battle me?
How many niggas dream of killing Clips?
I give you the fucking opportunity
And you ask for one round, you fucking idiot!
So for the fans that wanted you to kill me in three
And was hoping to see your stock rise
You subconsciously stabbed them in the back
And for that, you will never be top five
Now back to these bars...ain't you a reverend or some shit?
So what you know about throwing that chrome on styling?
Or your moms buying Idaho potatoes
But you using them to put your chrome on silent
No sound it's just...I let that chrome off smiling
Cause when it ring he'll get the Tec's/text but never know it, like his phone on silent
This is what you wanted nigga? You wanted me to be disrespectful
Put my dick in your niece fish tank, dump the water on your nephew
I Tsu Surf lock pick the door, like ""errrr"" show your family what that Tec do
Send 'em all in the sky for cheap, my hammer Jet Blue
Little message for you Detroit niggas that wanna get Clips
Scope on, one eye open, but it ain't Slick Rick
I don't wanna hear how y'all go in y'all Arsonal
To grab Shotgun's until they click click
Cause the only nigga that went to Arsonal for that Shotgun was Trick Trick
Arsonal and Shotgun would probably knock you the fuck out
So I don't wanna hear how you grip the Glock
You bird ass nigga
Since you a chicken I'd rather kill you using a chicken's pot
Like you better roll if you don't pay me, I throw that Idaho on that .380
Them shots steam, send you to Heaven with hot wings
Cause I mash potatoes for the gravy
We feeling on your chicken's breasts but you in love with that old whore
And you be snacking on her box but you don't know she a cold slaw
You ain't nothing but an old chicken that Smack threw in some new grease
Against a new beast that come with that biscuit, I'm like a two piece
If I catch you in that drop, I throw that biscuit to your top
You get your memory five
Since you riding like John F, it's only right I get Kennedy fried
You mentioning me in your blogs and your battles
It's like you can't go a day without me
So I called Ms. Cleo and she told me
""Every ting you plan to say about me.""
He gon' be like, ""I blame bloah again and soak him up like Shamwow again
And make him suffer, how you plan to get a deal? You fat motherfucker
You wore salmon pink against Ave Verb?"" but I'm still good in the gutter
See I'm a hustler
So I wore salmon to let you know I was good with the butter
He gon' be like, ""You ain't got no haircut in your blogs
How you expect to get your chicks wet?
We always see you in Harlem, but never see you with the Dipset
You got the image of a plumber
That's the only way you giving bitches pipe
And in ya battle with Verb you got more dislikes than likes.""
Now that's true, I do got more dislikes than likes, but that ain't shit to me
My 2nd battle, got paid more than you and 10 other niggas that night, I made history
You know how I'm that nigga?
Cause in your last two battles you had to mention me
You almost lost to Surf convincingly
So I made you battle DNA and Rich Dolarz just to get to me
Little nigga, how you expect to hold it down when you gon' correct me
And tell me how Street Fighter 1 ain't never had a bonus round?
It don't have a bonus round, see I be saucy when I say things
So if I fuck up a Street Fighter line
It must make you think that I play games
But if you do wanna play games, let's just make sure it's all action
A UFC type of game where it's kicking or all capping
We can throw the gloves on, play Fight Night with all jabbing
Cause if I throw a bullet you'll need a Raven's defense on All Madden
You might wanna hit Clips cause these offense lines get you mad as hell
But if I grip that hit stick, your helmet fly, you get a shit bag as well
If I bare/bear arms, you better turn Devon Hester running fast as hell
Or get this red circle in your head like Hines Ward in Madden 12
I am not a Game Boy
And you blacker than a PSP, you never seen cash
Your flow 16 bit, mine 32 that's why it seem fast
Catch 'em while he sleep, PlayStation 3 on the way that beam flash
Head shot, let his brains rest in his pillow, now that's a Dreamcast
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Say it again? I said...
I'm the controller, I leave squares like you so dead
So if X plan to try angles/triangles like Verb
He'll get an L 2/too and have to battle O-Red
Speaking of my nigga O-Red, ""manama, malala, manamama
Mala malama, manamma, manama, malama, manamma
Mama, manamama!""
Now my niggas behind me is like ""What the fuck was my man saying?""
My bad it's only two niggas that can speak this language
I'ma hit y'all with my translation...I said
Lil' nigga you better get low as possible before I let that mag hit you
ICU, your monitor on but your shit showing mad scribble
Your soul leaving your body, cause that's what happens when a mag hit you
So you brain dead, don't even know you travelling
You Lebron when he crab dribble
Now I done murdered you bar for bar and exposed you
The crowd was applauding me nigga, but it's something I forgot to do
Not the translation, I did the Lebron shit, now I remember
I gotta address your priorities, nigga
Two weeks ago I put you in my top 5 and like that I was in disbelief
And had to take you right out of my top five
Cause I found out that he a fucking thief
Remember when he told DNA ""You basic
Get a face lift when that 8 spit
Cause it'll blast and put DNA in a bag like a rape kid""
Now at that time I was like ""Woooo!"" cause that line was certainly fresh
But I realized you stole that from Dizaster
Cause he said he told Swave Sevah
""I'll put DNA in a box like a paternity test""
DNA, paternity test, rape kid, we all watch Law & Order SVU
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being black stealing punchlines from an Arab
That makes you a lame my nigga
Next time you wanna steal bars get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny
I'm trying to help you with your...priorities, nigga!
Or how 'bout when he told Rich Dolarz, ""I run up in ya state property
Properly, you ain't hot as me cause when it flash
It'll put Rich Dolarz in a bag like a bank robbery,"" right?
Now when I heard that I was like, ""woooh!"" cause that line was crazy then
I realized you stole that from DNA cause he battled Rich and said
""My shotgun will take Dolarz out like an ATM""
Dolarz, ATM, bank robbery, we all seen Set It Off
That shit is the same my nigga
So for you being 40, stealing lines from a 20 year old
That just makes you a lame my nigga
The next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
I'm not trying to be funny, I'm trying to help you with your priorities nigga
You fucking thief, you should end up dead in an alley like Raheem
Since you don't know how to keep it real
How do you ever expect to be Bishop if all you know a steal
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go rap it
Just cause a nigga bar cold don't mean you should go and jack it/jacket
So the next time you wanna steal bars, just get some authority nigga
And I really freestyled those last 4 lines but I hoped they helped you with your priorities nigga
Now this priority right here is some real shit that I gotta address
I thought you was a great father, but the way you treat your son is a mess
Remember when you wrote on Twitter how you be getting drunk
And be getting saucy off the dark
And you got so drunk that you lost your little son in the park?
Or what about when you battled Amzilla
And you said how you crazy and something wrong
And how you'll punch your son in the face if he stare at you for too long
You look like you get drunk
Beat you son and then leave him with the neighbors
Since you whipping your son ass, I""m whipping my son ass
But doing your son ass a favor
So the next time I hear you fucking with him
Or you raise your hand to fucking hit him
I'ma take a flight to Detroit
Pistol whip you and have ACS come and get him
So the next time you wanna beat him
You call me to get the authority nigga
Cause he's not yours no more, now he's my priority nigga
I hope you got a whole new scheme when you go to battle me nigga
Cause the priority shit is worn out now, it's time for reality nigga
If you battled Nemesis when DNA had a tooth
Then that means that was awhile ago
You been under Miles and Marv Won for years
And out of nowhere came Calicoe, you trying to be top 5 in battling
You not even top three in your own city
If they redid Bad Boy in Detroit, he'll be Biggie you'll be an old Diddy
You had your chance to be Biggie, then Miles took on T-Rex
You lost to Nemesis then got demoted to G-Dep
That nigga Miles got destroyed by Loaded Lux
We all seen the expression on you and your boss face
So you did have your chance to be Biggie cause that night you lost Faith
So I hope you go to do you thing when you go battle me nigga
Cause if you lose tonight, JC will be over you by tomorrow
And that's reality nigga
You said Rich Dolarz got on a stanky Yankee
I can't believe this is the same cat
In two blogs and three battles I caught you wearing the same hat
Type in QP versus B Magic he got on a black and purple Coogi sweater
Looking aight, so I was like, ""Yo my nigga getting his change better.""
Then I typed in ""X-Factor Summer Madness recap""
And the dirty nigga had on the same sweater
Now for all my hustlers in the trap
Y'all know wearing the same clothes twice ain't no thing
But they zoomed in on his sneakers and his Air Max had no strings
You wore the same sneakers, the same hat and the same stanky Coogi
But I know you don't know no better
Smack, lend him $250, buy a metro card, go to 14th and Main
Tell 'em I sent you and put you in a Polo sweater
Go burn that fucking Coogi the next time you come and battle me nigga
Cause now they all know you dirty and that's reality nigga
I'm glad you talking to me while I'm rapping
So now I go this lil' tune that I'm hearing the same
About how you ate Shooney the Rapper's ass
From out of Queen Of The Ring
You know what's funny? That's not even a joke, that shit is real fact
You ate a bitch that got more bars than you, that shit is real wack
I'm a freak myself, but under no circumstance do I feel that
A man's tongue should hang in the same hood that [?] and Scott chill at
So I know you gon' click and spray
You probably got a rhyme for every different day
I mean you eat ass, I'm pretty sure you got some shit to say
I thought this nigga here
You know what I fucked up, I forgot my damn line
Sike! You must be out your damn mind!
What do I look like choking?
Tell this nigga that's not cool
Get in a battle and go, ""I fuck with the boy Surf"" nigga I am not you
So the next time you go choke when you battle me nigga
Bizarre will never co-sign you again and that's reality nigga
Now I want you to get on Twitter right, tell 'em how you killed me
Tell a lie to those folks
But you know what's gon' hurt you?
When they watch this whole battle
And realize I ain't ever crack a nose joke
Time, nigga! Sike! I lied nigga!
Listen', don't worry 'bout why I ain't do three
Why you keep talking while I'm rapping?
They wouldn't call you if they wanted to see they father rap
My bars is crazy I make Detroit niggas have heart attacks
Now I said sike, I lied nigga, your nose look like a field goal's good
That shit is ""this"" wide nigga
It look like you could take a deep breath and smell what's outside nigga
If ya nose is that big, how could you tell your niggas, ""Good looking?""
Hold on see y'all niggas keep talking while I'm rapping
In the hood I learned to slaughter this work
He the first nigga that go on Phat Farm Nautica shirt
Get Calicoe? I mean y'all told me that awhile ago
Math said you ate Ms. Hustle pussy on her period
Nah, I'm just joke, I'm just joking...I mean serious
Now I'm to the hood where my troops control the block
Cause I just fat bitch bungee cord
Cut that shit short I got a Superbowl to watch
[Round 1: X-Factor]
I swear I'ma put an end to this bitch
And he lied on 90% of that shit, and you know that right
Ya fags off swag sauce
You got a fat back, skinny legs with man breast that sag off
With no bitch so Charlie Clips gotta rub a stick to blast off
X-Factor versus DNA, shit, my bad, I mean Charlie Clips
But I already off DNA using Charlie clip
Since we all know DNA be on Charlie clip
I give you a different way of looking at it
See I run up on Charlie like, ""What's popping?"" Charlie Clip
Up that 4-5th and snatch that ratchet off of Charlie hip
Smack the shit out Charlie's lip, probably knock the tooth out him
He spit it out, now we see DNA in Charlie Clips
But that's only the half of it, now it's blood all over that ratchet
So again, you'll see DNA on Charlie Clip
I'm a motherfucking veteran, varsity, Letterman
He all talk, Letterman, Verb, who let him in?
I'm on every fucking top 5 list to every men
On a list with the veterans, all niggas you're not better than
Mook, Rex, Lux, Miles, Math, Solomon, all niggas that's ahead of him
Fat gut chump, I give a fuck cause NY rank him like he so live
You got 2 battles on camera, I had that in '05
Now add that there, imaginary deal with Cam'
Fam' what? Chuck Philly so major?
But you know me, fuck is you? I'm doing the favor
NYC all I ask is y'all give a nigga props
And if he say some shit that's hot and it's hot, then let it rock
But if he say some shit that's not hot and y'all gas it and give it props
The cameras never lie, so the fans gon' see it's not
Now I""m not battling Charlie Clips because I think this nigga nice
It's cause the fans got him hype and to me you just aight
But I had a talk with my conscience in public, fuck it
We was deep in, I'm reasoning with these mahfuckas
Cars riding by, beeping, but see the talk I had with my conscience
My conscience spoke a lil' knowledge
That reasonable me said he was nice
But the arrogant side said he was garbage
Reasonable me: ""X I ain't gon' lie, that boy Charlie Clips is nice
And if you take that nigga light, he'll probably put an end to your night
And you done came too far to be on top of this battle shit
To battle Clips and not let that whole 'matic clip spit at average Clips
I said, ""You right"" but before I could get a word out
The asshole tapped me and said, ""X can I please have my words now?""
He said, ""Man that nigga trash, that nigga butt, that nigga ass
He couldn't see you if you lived in a crib in Time Square and it was glass
You did legendary shit, killed DNA and bodied Rich
Priorities nigga, that's a hit, how many round he had? Six
And see three of which he battled a nigga that was sick
But Tay took a two year break so he swung back and he didn't hit
The other three in which he battled a nigga that had some shit
But Verb didn't just battle Clips
But like 3,000 fans that was riding this nigga's dick
I said, ""Shit, y'all both right, and take sides is kind of hard to
So I'll take advice from both and show niggas I'm impartial
I""ll give 'em bars like I'm 'bout to go 30 rounds with Marshall
But still feel you don't deserve these small bars that I've [?] you
Now bars I got 'em often, he been doing a lot of barking
He must be high so it's only right he's taking an L for talking
Jump in that 40 it's hearse day
Your trunk that's where your skirt and your purse stay
That .38 Special, a retard two years before his 40th birthday
Clips is on that walk of fame, putting in a lot of hard work
But be careful what you say out your mouth spitting them bars jerk
Cause if it's beef and my niggas peep you in that car first
They Dial us (Dallas) we come with them cal' boy (Cowboys)
For thinking we candy I'll leave that Star burst
I bet you 10 times outta 10 under your left titty stink
And since you've waken, you've eaten 5 guys about 5 times
Wendy's fries and a Big Mac
I'm off the hip, two cans when I blow
So if that's first one miss you
Your kids will die from the cig' off the 2nd hand smoke
Uh oh, I'm back on my shit again
Clips done took that bait like a fisherman
Reel 'em in, what's on my waist mean black can sing, Aunt Vivian
You see Uncle Phil, I'm Fresh and the Prince of Michigan
I told my killer Jeffrey I'll give you/U K's, now send him 10
Hit him from this waist to his neck
You button then I'll bend ya men (Benjamin)
You're not a man in my eyes, your vagina trying to play hard
When that 4 on me, no sorority but I'll cap a/Kappa
I'll ride through Harlem comfortable with them guys with me
Charlie's nowhere in sight unless the bakery's giving pies for free
But if you do see me, be easy giving that eye to me
Because 16 from that Charger will bust, no Ryan Leaf
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built so why would I waste a round?
I say Conceited slow that down
I take the pound, run up on him, lay him down, face the ground
I figure he ain't built (belt) so why would I waste/waist a round/around
You a fat nigga bugging, who ain't seen below his waist since a kid
The first time he saw his toes he thought they was chicken nuggets
Fat nigga start spazzing, damn near had a heart attack
Cause he couldn't grab 'em
I got bars, I got jokes, my stage presence is a gift
I control that crowd beautifully
I planned your eulogy for the fifth
He tried to run and was open so I blew one through his shit
And told the judge, ""You aren't supposed to put bullets into clips""
Start a show and I'll get to clapping
Tonight it all ends, I'm 'bout to silence this nigga, Charlie Chaplin
Leave that whip smoking til it's rolling, it'll look like the Marley's passing
Run up on it, break the glass, clap half his back in
Til his lap catches his abdomen and that whip slip and hit, crash and bend
You the type to get mangled with them bars
Fuck around and wanna tangle (tango)
Well I'll send you Dancing With The Stars
In that court singing, get carried/Carey'd when that Cannon go off
Then I squirt until it earth, my seed planted in her jaws
I be going HAM, up dumping, squeezing that pump
Clips be going HAM, add bacon, cheese...
No remorse I'll even slump his lil' cunt
Let that fif' swisher, sheesh I had to be blunt
From what I heard you be begging bitches to get off in they vagina
But I also heard bitches is never on your tip cause it's tiny
Just ask your whore, she love when slam her raw
She told me when my Thing get rocked it's what I'm Fantastic 4/for
Fuck this battling shit, you'll think that chrome was his clone
The way I'll have Charlie battling Clips
I'm usually mild mannered but act in this damn place
I'll slap this man face til his jaw snap like blacks after a handshake
I won't even put the heater to him
Niggas start yapping to the coppers cause they'll be locked up
Before the choppers get to squeezing through him
Now I gotta skip town, a couple pounds I bet C'll do him
Cause soon as I touchdown TD, Jakes, he'll be preaching to 'em
I tried to listen to his album, Calicoe was like, ""Why fam'?""
I'ma keep it a buck and a half, it's trash, I ain't gon' lie fam'
I said, ""Fuck it"" I even tried to listen to it fried then
I played 2 and 5, damn near committed suicide
I couldn't feel/fill this high
I got that Shotty in, I'll let that Shotty spin
And let his wig hold the whole clip like a Bobby pen
My bottom bitch thick as a steak, boy stop that
You saucy cause your A1 bitch couldn't top that
I'm at my girls house watching battles
I said, ""Come here baby, this 'bout to be some shit.""
She said, ""Ohh, Fatman Scoop?!""
I said, ""No, that's Charlie Clips""
But anyway, that nigga there can spit
Halfway in his third against Aye Verb
That's when I witnessed some shit
Now it was on some gay shit but he said Verb be on some gay shit
And right after Verb say some gay shit, he licks his lips
Now that's when I seen some gay shit
But you said Verb lick his lips every time he say some gay shit
And right in the middle of you talking 'bout all that gayness
Charlie Clips turned around and licked his lips
As y'all see I'm getting bored with this nigga
But y'all know I wasn't gonna end it without addressing at least one of your priorities nigga
Against Tay Roc - 200, against Verb - about 305
Nigga, that's growth at a rapid rate
Easy on the cheeseburgers and chili cheese steaks
These your niggas right?
Y'all down to ride? Righter there letting that .380 fly
Who gon' be down to right with helping this mahfucka stay alive?
No that's real shit, I'm being honest, that' my word A
You got no kids, you're not married, I know you want that in your old age
But at the rate that you're going you'll probably die in your sleep by 38
High blood pressure by 31, diabetes by 33, congestive heart failure by 36
I'm saying you my mans and I'm just worried Clips
But you been in the gym, I can tell you trying to get back
Pull ups for your delts, couple dips for your las
I'm backing you 100%, that's all I gotta say scrap
But just remember just because you're ate fat you don't have to stay that
Now soon you gon' walk in that spot and see cones with the ice cream
Freshly baked German chocolate cake topped with the icing
Now for you that's probably high torture my nigga
But before you go make a slice and take a bite
Think life and how got to live a lot more of it my nigga
Now I'm not saying this to be funny
Or try to wipe the floor with this nigga
But I feel like this is real life and Clips it's priorities nigga
When that mac buck duck you lil' fat gut fuck
As y'all see I just spazzed on this nigga and y'all niggas know
I just fat bitch bungee cord snapped on this nigga"
180,2001,Jamie O'Neal,When I Think About Angels,"[Verse 1:]
Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Verse 2:]
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction
[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you
Ohhh, ohh, ohhhh
When I think about you, baby
Yeah, yeah
I think about you"

Leave your name and your number at the motherfucking beep
If this one of my hoes, two-way me

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke

Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on
[Master P]
Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got
But they call me Bill Clinton for all the head I got

190,2001,Depeche Mode,Dream On,"[Intro: Dave Gahan]
Can you feel a little love?

[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
As your boney fingers close around me
Long and spindly, death becomes me
Heaven, can you see what I see?
Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given, mmh

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching
[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?
Dream on, dream on

[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it's well-rehearsed
It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given

Can you feel a little love?
Dream on, dream on
Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?

You're here, I'm pleased, I really dig your company

What a king's supposed to be; baby, I feel free
Come on and go with me

Share our situation, temptation, education, relaxation
Elevation, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background, it ain't squeaky clean, shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all a sinner
But you put your good foot down and make your soul the winner
I respect that; man, you're so phat; and you're all that,plus supreme
Then you're humble; man, I'm numb with your feeling
I can feel everything that you bring

Or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent

193,2001,Blake Shelton,Austin,"[Verse 1]
She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then
[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you"

Doin' my thing on a Friday night

That's when everybody stopped dancing
And I couldn't stop myself staring
Yeah I couldn't breathe, no I couldn't believe my eyes

Five inch heals, watch how I move
Watch how I shake it to the beat, how I do

But I gotta hold back, I'm a lady
Well who knows maybe I could be your baby

195,2001,Cyndi Thomson,What I Really Meant To Say,"(Cyndi Thomson/Chris Waters/Tommy Lee James)

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know
What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say
That's what I really meant to say"

197,2001,Vertical Horizon,Best I Ever Had (Grey Sky Morning),"So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back

What's love?

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, uh, uh
Woo! Yeah, slow down, baby
Let you know from the gate I don't go down lady
I wanna chick with thick hips that licks her lips
She can be the office type or like to strip
Girl, you get me aroused how you look in my eye
But you talk too much, man, you're ruinin' my high
Don't wanna lose the feelin' cause, the roof is chillin
It's on fire and you lookin good for the gettin'
I'ma, rider, whether in a hoodie or a linen
A provider; you should see the jewelry on my women
And I'm, livin' it up, the Squad stay fillin the truck
With chicks that's willin' to triz with us, uh
You say you gotta man and you're in love
But what's love gotta do with a little menage?
After the par-tay, me and you
Could just slide for a few and she could come too
That's love!
[Chorus: Ashanti & (Ja Rule)]
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it, babe)
What's love? It's about us, it's about trust, babe

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh - yeah.. yo, uh, yo
Mami I know you got issues; you gotta man
But you need to understand that you got somethin' with you
Ass is fat, frame is little
Tattoo on your chest with his name in the middle, uh
I'm not a hater, I just crush a lot
And the way you shake your booty, I don't want you to stop
You need to come a little closer... (Come a little closer)
And let me put you, under my arms like a Don is supposed ta
Please believe, you leave with me
We be freakin' all night like we was on E
You need to trust the God and jump in the car
For a little hard eight at the Taj Mahal
What's love?

[Chorus: Ashanti & (Ja Rule)]
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it, babe)
What's love? It's about us, it's about trust, babe

What's love?
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Yeah, uh, yo
Yo I stroll in the club with my hat down
Michael Jack style, hot steppin', who the mack now?
Not my fault cause they love the kid
Might be the chain or the whip, I don't know what it is
We just party and bullshit; c'mon mami
Put your body in motion, you got a nigga open
You came here with the heart to cheat
So you need to sing the song with me
All my ladies come on

[Bridge: Ashanti & (Fat Joe)]
When I look in your eyes, there's no stoppin' me
I want the Don Joey Crack on top of me (Uh-huh)
Don't want your stacks just break my back (Yeah)
Gonna cut you no slack, cause I'm on it like that (Uh, woo, uh)
Come on (Yeah yeah, y'all)
And put it all (Yeah yeah, y'all) on me (Put it on ya, girl)
On me (I'ma put it on ya, girl)

[Chorus: Ashanti & (Ja Rule)]
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it, babe)

What's love? It should be about us, it should be about trust, babe
What's love? (Got to do, got to do with it, babe)

What's love?"
203,2002,Eminem,Without Me,"[Intro: Obie Trice]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
[Outro: Eminem]
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Hum dei dei la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la
Kids!"
204,2002,Nelly,Hot In Herre,"[Intro: Nelly]
It's hot in, so hot in here
So hot in... (Ah)
Oh!

[Refrain: Nelly]
Want a little bit of (Uh, uh), and a little bit of (Uh, uh)
Just a little bit of, just a little bit of
Just a little bit of, just a little bit of

[Verse 1: Nelly]
I was like, good gracious, ass is bodacious (Uh)

And I feel like touchin' you, uh, uh
And can't nobody stop the juice

[Chorus: Nelly & Dani Stevenson]
It's gettin' hot in here (So hot)

Why you at the bar if you ain't poppin' the bottles? (C'mon)
What good is all the fame if you ain't fuckin' the models?
I see you drivin' sports cars, ain't hittin' the throttle
And I'll be down to do a hundred, top down and goggles
Got off the freeway, exit 106, and parked it
Ash tray, flip gate, time to spark it
Gucci collar for dollar, got out and walked it
I spit game 'cause, baby, I can't talk it
Warm (Uh), sweatin' (Uh), it's hot up in this joint
Vokal tanktop on at this point
You wit' a winner so, baby, you can't lose
I got secrets can't leave Cancun
So take it off like you're home alone
You know, dance in front your mirror while you're on the phone
Checkin' your reflection and tellin' your best friend

You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream
[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

[Verse 3: Truth Hurts]
Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin
My ups, my downs, my high and my lows
From head to toe, he makes me glow
He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Rakim]
Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted
You OG'd and you OD: addicted"

And you needed someone to show you the way
So I took your hand and we figured out that
When the tide comes, I'd take you away

There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

Oh yes
(Uh, this for you, girl)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Nas]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be okay (I need to be okay)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)
So now it's time for me to make that move (Uh, check it)

[Verse 4: Nas & (Jennifer Lopz)]
Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright"

Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed

You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other

Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling
[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
Whoa-oh-oh
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve

Who will be there to take my place?

To light the shadows on your face

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low

To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

Pushed as far as I can go
For all this

This essay examines spaces within hip-hop culture where hip-hop feminist thought and activism might make significant interventions. It offers an exploratory examination of hip-hop feminism in an effort to map out an agenda for the twenty-first century. The essay is not concerned with hard-and-fast answers to the combination of feminism and hip-hop but rather with what hip-hop feminism might add to current conversations surrounding race, class, gender, and sexuality. By examining the conscious/commercial rap dichotomy, the discussions surrounding video models, lyrics by rapper Jean Grae, and the work of contemporary women authors, this essay opens the door for further dialogue about women, rap, and hip-hop feminismI know I’m on the right path
To who I’m gonna be at last
So don’t rush me
I know I’m wrong and right
At the same time both, I’m the dark and light
And they say life means everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
So don’t rush me Don’t rush me

    -Jean Grae, “Don’t Rush Me”

Trying to capture the voice of all that is young black female was impossible. My goal, instead, was to tell my truth as best I could from my vantage point on the spectrum. And then get you to talk about it. This book by its lonesome won’t give you the truth. Truth is what happens when your cumulative voices fill in the breaks, provide the remixes, and rework the chorus

    -Joan Morgan, When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks it Down[79]
The epigraphs from rapper Jean Grae and hip-hop feminist Joan Morgan hint at the varieties and contradictions embedded in hip-hop feminism.1 The third-wave feminist leanings, along with black feminist and womanist agendas, make for a study in shifts and unevenness. The third wave represents the generation of feminists that hip-hop feminism is a part of. This generation of feminists is best represented theoretically in anthologies such as Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation (Findlen 1995), To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism (Walker 1995), The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism (Labaton and Martin 2004), Colonize This! Young Women of Color on Today’s Feminism (Hernandez and Rehman 2002), and Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century (Dicker and Piepmeier 2003). The black feminist and womanist agendas are agendas that hip-hop feminists, the majority of whom are black women, share with their foremothers who saw their struggles with gender oppression as intimately connected to their struggles with race and class oppressions. They were women whose agendas kept firmly in sight the survival of the entire people. A hip-hop state of mind—one that freely samples, mixes, and remixes—influences the theoretical underpinnings of hip-hop feminism as well as the activism of hip-hop feminists. This essay highlights some of the ways hip-hop feminist agendas have taken shape while always keeping in mind, as the epigraphs from Jean Grae and Joan Morgan show, there won’t be just one truth but multiple ones. In fact, sometimes the contradictions that make for the “wrong and right . . . dark and light” of it will help feminists to better do what Joan Morgan suggests feminism needs to do—be “brave enough to fuck with the grays” (1999, 59). This essay is an exploratory essay that seeks to examine the various articulations of hip-hop feminist expressions as a way to provide a starting point and possible template for a hip-hop feminist agenda

Women have been representing in hip-hop culture ever since the mid 1970s, when the culture got its start in the South Bronx, and they represent still. They have been and still are B-girls, women breakers, graffiti artists, deejays, and emcees. Today, we can add to the mix women writing and thinking about the culture who call themselves hip-hop feminists. I take the stance that hip-hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands beyond rap music. Hip-hop has been defined by many as a way of life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, deejaying, break dancing, rap music, and the oft-forgotten fifth element, knowledge. [80] It has recently expanded to include genres such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also expanded enough to include its own brand of feminism. The writing of third-wave black feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, Shani Jamilla, dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards is expanding black feminist theory and black women’s intellectual traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who loved hip-hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist and womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative nonfiction. But what exactly is a hip-hop feminist? And what does hip-hop feminism do? I maintain that although we now have a relatively clear idea of what constitutes a hip-hop feminist, we are less certain about what a hip-hop feminist agenda should be

Hip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender exploitation in hip-hop. From the Feminism and Hip-Hop Conference at the University of Chicago in 2005 to the B-Girl Be conferences in Minneapolis and countless symposiums and smaller conferences on the status of women in hip-hop to the list serves and Yahoo groups devoted to women, feminism, and hip-hop, there appears to be a surge in women and men thinking and talking about gender issues in hip-hop and combining that talk with action. From the publication of several key essays and Joan Morgan’s pivotal book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost in the 1990s to the Spelman women who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly to Essence Magazine’s “Take Back the Music” campaign, we can begin to see the ways this movement’s knowledge-building and consciousness-raising have taken shape. It might be too soon to talk about the impact that the movement has had, but it is not too soon to think about some of the key concerns and agendas that the movement seems to be taking up. I aim to flesh some of this out by building on some of the work that I did in my book Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere (2004) and by examining a few areas where women have used hip-hop to claim a public voice. I want to look at the spaces where hip-hop feminism can make interventions as starting points for a possible feminist agenda in hip-hop. However, they will not all be feminist spaces or even have outright feminists messages. Instead, they are spaces where hip-hop feminists, activists, and thinkers can possibly evoke change

Krista Ratcliffe (2006) writes about giving her students a feminist literacy through which to read society. Elaine Richardson carefully details the ways in which the young women who listen to and love hip-hop process the images and have thoughtful and critical conversations about the culture and the music when she examines female hip-hop literacies in her book Hiphop Literacies (2006). [81] And it has me thinking seriously about what a hip-hop feminist literacy would allow us to do and why we need one. Thinking of recent controversies such as Don Imus calling the Rutgers women’s basketball team “nappy-headed hoes” and Michael Richards’s meltdown in which he boldly and blatantly brandished the n-word at black men he thought were hecklers and the quick way just about everyone quickly made a move to blame hip-hop has me seriously considering what a worldwide hip-hop feminist literacy could give us in these situations. Would we continue to have conversations that blame rappers for white racist men doing what white racist men do all day every day? Or would we instead be able to really look at the nuances of the situation and see, for example, that while there was some racism underlying Imus’s statement, the sexism and underlying homophobia were palpable. And like racism, the sexism and homophobia predates hiphop in Imus’s politics and certainly in this country that deals with both on a regular. But even as we had these conversations and teased out these issues with our hip-hop feminist lens, we would still be able to critique hip-hop for its sexism and homophobia as well. We just wouldn’t blame hip-hop when people old enough to know better show their true colors, colors they have been showing all along. The fact is that young women who listen to rap music and participate in hip-hop culture already have critiques of sexism and misogyny. They have things to say about the culture and the world around them if we are prepared to listen. This essay is therefore an attempt at understanding what they might offer the larger society the next time we have such public pedagogical moments as those offered by Imus and Richards

So, Shorty’s a Feminist?
Several black and third-wave feminists have started to approach the tenuous relationship between rap music/hip-hop culture and feminism in their writing. They offer a variety of different feminist perspectives on rap, rappers, and women. Some condemn the sexism in rap and encourage others to do the same. Others offer complicated analyses that critique the larger societal issues that contribute to rap’s sexism, production, and consumption. Some offer third-wave feminist critiques that question how one can be a child of the hip-hop generation, love the music, and still critique and actively speak out against the sexism. They all offer examples of how feminists have begun to deal with, think about, and write about rap music and hip-hop culture

Most hip-hop feminists believe that some of the needs of the hip-hop generation require new strategies and different voices. They have a strong [82] relationship to the “self,” and they connect their personal narratives with theoretical underpinnings and critique. They hold themselves and their peers responsible for effecting change in the present and future by encouraging people to recognize and combat their own complicity. In terms of rap music and hip-hop culture, they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word “bitch” or “ho” to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For example, they also want to begin to complicate understandings of women’s complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. And as Joan Morgan reminds us, “the focus of Black feminists has got to change. We can’t afford to keep expending energy on banal discussion of sexism in rap when sexism is only part of a huge set of problems” (1999, 76). They are concerned with and spend a lot of time writing about black women’s relationships with black men. They want to encourage a dialogue between black men and women, men rappers and women

A hip-hop feminist is more than just someone who likes to listen to rap music and feels conflicted about it. A hip-hop feminist is someone who is immersed in hip-hop culture and experiences hip-hop as a way of life. Hip-hop as a culture, in turn, influences his or her worldview or approach to life. In fact, one of the reasons why Elaine Richardson, Aisha Durham, Rachel Raimist, and I decided to edit Home Girls Make Some Noise: A Hip-Hop Feminism Anthology (2007) was because we wanted to think about hip-hop feminism beyond the conflicted, “I’m a feminist and I love hip-hop, woe-is-me” standpoint. We wanted to create a space to talk across disciplines through activism, the arts, and academia to better understand the very important and vital work going on in this area. Hip-hop feminists are working as community activists. They are working for reproductive justice. And they are trying to think about ways to combat the growing prison-industrial complex in relation to women of color and the equally astounding HIV/AIDS rates. And they are also still very much concerned with representations of women of color in rap music videos and the harm that these images can do. So, I want to move now to one area that hip-hop feminism continues to grapple with: the video vixen

Shorty Wants to be a Star: Video Vixens Representing Women of Color?

In her groundbreaking book, Prophets of the Hood, Imani Perry notes the following about the recent trends in hip-hop music videos: “It seemed to happen suddenly. Every time one turned on BET (Black Entertainment [83] Television) or MTV, one encountered a disturbing music video: Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits, or scantily clad in some other fashion. Video after video proved the same, each one more objectifying than the former. Some took place in strip clubs, some at the pool, at the beach, or in hotel rooms, but the recurrent theme was dozens of half-naked women” (2004, 175). With the release of Karrine Steffans’s tell-all memoir, Confessions of a Video Vixen (2005), the topic of women, music videos, and objectification is once again on everyone’s minds. But even more so, the questions surrounding objectification have become complicated in important ways. No longer can we make claims about what is happening to the women in the videos without complicating the discussion by adding their voices. Although Steffans says that she wrote the book as a cautionary tale for little girls who want to grow up and be video girls, the book reads more like a how-to with just enough name-dropping and gossip to fill inquiring minds. In fact, with the release of It’s No Secret by Carmen Bryan, rapper Nas’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, it seems as if some marketing person in the publishing industry figured out a way to capitalize on mixing the current Zane-inspired erotica fervor with hip-hop glitterati in order to cater to a gossip-obsessed culture and recent trends in reality programming. These kinds of books appeal to a variety of people because of the way they play into the genres listed above. However, what does come across clearly as one reads the Steffans’s memoir and Bryan’s tell-all are the ways in which some women have chosen to buy into the sexism and misogyny that limits the roles that women can play in hip-hop culture

The issues of representation and objectification in hip-hop offer many variables that all must be considered if we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the topic. The ways in which the men artists and male and female video directors objectify the women in their lyrics and videos is one aspect. The ways in which the women video models and hip-hop artists choose to objectify themselves in a quest to make money and earn a living is another. And the way these images straddle the very thin line between validation of black women bodies and objectification is yet another aspect. The truth of the matter is that we are now in a(n) historical moment where the bodies of women of color flood popular culture in ways that they never have before. As hip-hop culture expands and dominates mainstream popular culture, the hip-hop video becomes more than just a music video. The impact of these videos on women of color is vast. Hip-hop music videos are spreading representations of U.S. women of color around the globe. [84]

I have written elsewhere that hip-hop culture did not spring up full grown on its own and that it builds on other legacies that exist in the culture and the community that we are not always willing to own (see Pough 2001). Others have noted that hip-hop does not exist in a social-cultural vacuum, that as a part of the larger culture it takes on elements of the larger culture as well (see Potter 1995; Rose 1994). So when we look at the hip-hop centerfolds that exist in Source Magazine and XXL, with their monthly “Dime Piece” and “Eye Candy” sections, we cannot discuss them in isolation and certainly not without at least mentioning the long-running Jet Magazine “Beauty of the Week.” And when we talk about the ways in which hip-hop videos are similar to pornography, we cannot have the conversation without looking at the ways in which pornography has infiltrated the larger culture as well. Can you say “girls gone wild”?

None of this is meant to take away from the damage that these pornographic images of women of color in hip-hop do. What I do want to look at, however, are the ways in which these tropes impact our thoughts about women of color and how they in turn impact the lives of young women. The words of women like Zulaika Jumaralli (2005) who claim “Music Videos Broke My Spirit” come to mind as I think about the power of these videos and the impact that they have. I think of women like the black women students at Duke, who, outraged by the recent alleged gang rape of a black woman by white members of the university lacrosse team, loudly proclaim, that they are “not your video ho.” In an article written by Fiona Morgan (2006), these students share stories of being expected to be sexually available and inappropriately propositioned by white men on campus just because of their race. One student says, “As a black female, you go to a party. You’re expected to dance. You’re expected to be sexually provocative. You are expected to want to be touched, to be grabbed, to be fondled.” Another student adds, “As if they’re reenacting a rap video or something. As if we’re their video ho, basically. We can’t just be regular students here. We can’t just go to a party and enjoy ourselves” (F. Morgan 2006). As much as we try to move away from allowing negative images to impact our lives, there are real implications that we need to contend with. Add to this the multiple stories of black women who have traveled to other parts of the world only to be approached as if they are a video vixen by the men in the countries they are visiting, and we can see how far these attitudes about women of color extend

I also think about the hip-hop feminist warriors who are bringing wreck in the public sphere by talking back—women like the Spelman women, who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video [85] “Tip Drill,” only to have that attempt at dialogue stilted and to receive criticism themselves for being elitist college women looking down their noses at the women who are making an honest living in the video and the poor artist who only wants to share his art with the world. While I offer the statements above in a tongue-in-cheek manner, several interviews in which Nelly spoke about his “ordeal” painted the Spelman women in this way. I am also informed by hip-hop feminist writers like Karen R. Good, who, fed-up with the whole images, representation, and objectification debates, offers her own treatise:But as of late, many of hip-hop’s children have been playing the cheapest trick: depending on undulating female, colored bodies to entice weak minds and compensate for weak rhymes. Or our bodies are used for verbal target practice. I am way past anger. Shock went the way of “Bitches Ain’t Shit.” Don’t feel like being sad. I just wonder about the worth of a black girl. You know, like the difference between what happens when little white girls go missing and little black girls go missing. Or get raped. Pissed on. That type of shit. . . . That said, not one more lecture. I put my hands up. Man, if you want to swipe a credit card down the crack of a woman’s behind, or Miss, if you want to let yo ass be the machine, fine. To each his own. The culprit is not hip-hop, which is undergoing a beautiful evolution, by the way (hear Mos Def’s “The Rape Over”), it’s our reliance on the baser nature as opposed to the higher mind. Hip-hop is the thinker’s form. (2005, 29–30)As I think about the video vixen and her relationship to a hip-hop feminist agenda, I do so keeping the fervor and the sentiment of these very different responses to the images in mind. As the black women students at Duke remind us, the images have the power to hurt. As the negative backlash to the Spelman women shows us, when we speak out or try to initiate a dialogue, we open ourselves up for criticism. And as Karen Good reminds us, the images are not the sum and total of hip-hop and certainly not what is representative of the culture, which is in constant evolution. But they do exist and we do need to interrogate them. And when we do, we need to add to the mix the voices, stories, and reasons these women give for participating in the objectification. Only then will we get a more nuanced and complicated discussion of the video vixen

By adding their voices, we indeed get a discussion that highlights the gray areas that Joan Morgan writes about. These women see the videos as their entry into the world of stardom. They are aspiring actresses, models, singers, and even rappers themselves. They gladly pose in the magazines and preen in the videos, and the best and brightest of them are paid very well [86] to do so. Some even make up to $3,000 a day.2 These are not necessarily the poor, victimized women of old. Some of them have a critique of the business, and they recognize their role in a society in which sex sells. Video girl Tawny, interviewed by Jeanne Amber for Essence Magazine, notes: “If video girls are being exploited, then every female artist who is out there being sexy should be blamed too. To me, it’s all bull——” (Amber 2005, 165). Former video model, BET host, and entrepreneur Melyssa Ford notes of her own career and decisions:I’m the highest-paid video girl to date. I’ve endured all the snide comments and ignorant remarks from people who presume to know me because I’m on their television screens and in the pages of their magazines. But I’m not the promiscuous twit I’m often mistaken for. I am a business-woman who has used videos to launch a multimedia career. My product is me. Besides being the lead girl in hip-hop and R&B videos, I am a sex columnist for a men’s magazine. I star in my own DVD. I’ve hosted television shows, and I’ve produced my own calendar, which I sell on the internet. My job is to sell fantasy and perfection. When the cameras go on, I detach myself and play the sexy vixen who will turn a nigga out. (quoted in Byrd and Solomon 2005, 219–20)The fact is, these women are making decisions—decisions informed by a variety of variables—to be in these videos, to pose for these magazines. While I do not pretend that their decision-making takes away from the systems of oppression surrounding them that make not making the decision to objectify themselves difficult, I do not want to ignore the agency, real or imagined, that these women have. How does their agency complicate our discussions of objectification? I don’t pretend to have the answer to this, and I don’t even want to suggest that there is one cut-and-dry answer. But I do know that as feminists, we can no longer have these conversations without including their voices and their stories. And when we add their voices and stories to the mix, they bring with them those dark and light, wrong and right mixtures that Jean Grae raps about and the subtle shades of gray that Joan Morgan writes about

The video vixen’s agency is important, and the work of visual artist Ayanah Moor adds layers to this conversation by thinking about the ways these women may be exhibiting agency even as they participate in the demeaning videos. Her collection of video shots, “STILL,” is one example of the way Moor uses her art to complicate the discussion. The text that goes along with the montage of video stills represented in the collection states: [87]STILL Images of women surrounding male rap stars in music videos is as common as the jewel encrusted subject matter of today’s rap lyrics. Females are seen in packs hovering around male rap stars, playing the part of enthusiastic cheerleader or die-hard groupie. Rap music videos sell not only hiphop culture, but also the very image of its women. They serve as eye candy designed to satisfy an assumed male video audience, affirming critiques of the culture as hyper masculine and misogynist. STILL is a series of photographs from contemporary rap music videos. These artworks invite a second look at the hip-hop video vixen, displaying an interest in moments unintended by music video narratives. Some stills reveal agency rather than victimization, while others provide reminders of the narrow representations of women in hip-hop. (Moor 2006)Moor’s “STILL,” the hip-hop feminist discussions surrounding video models, and the video models voices and stories show, I hope, what a rich space the issues of video images and representation can be if we think about issues of agency in more complicated ways. Combining these might allow us to better interrogate the following questions. For example, what does it mean that hip-hop has the capability to make a woman a pseudosuperstar, sought after by magazines and video directors based on solely on how she looks? And how does this further complicate our understandings of how black women respond to things like the ideal beauty image? Does the influx of other kinds of beauty—meaning black and women of color—into the mainstream disrupt the norm? Does it simply add yet another impossible ideal for women to yearn for that now makes women of color, particularly black women, vulnerable in ways that they haven’t been in the past? All of these questions are complicated and warrant far more space than this cursory look at possible hip-hop feminist agendas allows. But they are spaces in which hip-hop feminism can make meaningful interventions. I will now move to another space in which there are possibilities for a hip-hop feminist agenda by examining female emcee Jean Grae

Shorty Got Love for the Game: Jean Grae,Hip-Hop, Feminism, and change (Or ... Simply... I wish she were a feminist...)

What would happen if we had feminist emcees moving millions toward a critique of gender that motivated them toward change? Why haven’t we had any women emcees with this kind of feminist agenda? What would happen if we could harness the power that rap music has to make people dance and make them work toward change in women’s lives? When studying [88] feminism in relation to hip-hop, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most women emcees are not checking for the F word. They won’t claim it. Won’t label themselves with it. Will not touch it. This is not to say that there are no feminist women rappers. However, the fact remains that as much as we champion and claim certain women rappers for their lyrics, their outreach activities, their “positive” messages, or their “prowoman” messages, very few women rappers will go on record saying that they are feminist
Taking a page from black feminist theorist Patricia Hill Collins, who in her essay “What’s in a Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond” (1999) ultimately comes to the conclusion that quibbling over what we call ourselves is less important than the work we do to evoke change, I posit that while we cannot in good conscience place the label of “feminist”—hip-hop, thirdwave, black feminist, or womanist—on most contemporary women rappers, we can—as feminist scholars and activists—use the music they produce and the issues they raise to begin to enact change. In this regard, rising hip-hop artist Jean Grae becomes an interesting case study for hip-hop feminism even if she denounces feminism for herself: “I’m not a feminist by any means, I just want people to enjoy the music” (Thomas 2004). In much of her music to date—her two CDs, Attack of the Attacking Things: The Dirty Mixes and This Week, as well as her EP, The Bootleg of the Bootleg—we can easily see the concerns of hip-hop feminists put to music

Grae’s two albums and EP have garnered critical acclaim, and just about every review I have read noted her stellar lyrics and vocal delivery but bemoaned the production and the lack of killer beats. What comes across in most interviews is the fact that she is going to make music and have a career on her own terms. We won’t see her taking off her clothes to sell records. But she is quick to stop interviewers who want to label her the Anti–Lil’ Kim, Anti–Foxy Brown, or Anti-Trina. She does not have a problem with her fellow women rappers. She has a problem with an industry that won’t allow a fullness of black womanhood to be represented. She notes: “You know what, that’s not me. That’s not how I live. And that’s not how I do. But there are females that do. I think it’s messed up that there is not an opportunity for someone who is not doing that to have an equal chance. And that is the problem. It’s like there has to be some choice . . . have some other shit. Balance it all out. Apparently for some odd reason, that is not allowed” (Bloom 2004). She knows what she is willing to do and she knows what she has to offer: “I want to break the formula, and make history for myself. I want people to know I’m a skilled writer and lyricist that isn’t afraid to be honest. I’m stubborn. I refuse to change myself [89] for a machine” (Dyer 2004). I have to admit, when it comes to hip-hop, I am all about the lyrics. The beat is important, yes—couldn’t be a true hip-hop head and not acknowledge that. But the beat is not going to make me buy the record. In fact, I’m much more excited when the beat takes me back to the essence, the simple boom bap. So, the reviews that bemoaned the lack of cutting-edge production and beats on Jean Grae’s CDs didn’t faze me. Her lyrics blew me away. Her lyrics, style, and delivery are like one part Jigga, two parts Nas, a healthy dose of gender consciousness, race consciousness, and, lo and behold, a pinch of a global awareness for good measure

On her first album, Attack of the Attacking Things, Jean Grae critiques the sexism in hip-hop. In the song “Knock” she raps, “Ask me bastard if I’m signed / I rhyme sick / but niggas is quick to turn they back on spitters with clits / Hit em with this, and ridiculous phrase flow that exit my lips / Hey yo, I mean my face, though / they still want chicks with tits and ass out / my respect is worth more than your advance cash-out.” In the song “What Would I Do?” she raps: “I’m Jean Grae, honorable team player for years / Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes / For sho’ it’s crunch time / I’m the one they sent to piss your label off / they won’t fuck with me unless I’m parading and taking it off.” She is very conscious of the sexism in the music industry and the exploitation of women in particular. And her lyrics and her interviews show that she is raging against that machine

Perhaps what is most worthy of mention is the way that the song “What Would I Do?” aims to inspire change. The chorus asks: “What, what, what would I do? / If like my people said, I left it to you. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I didn’t try a verse, if I didn’t rhyme. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I just hated and did nothing to change it” The chorus makes the listeners question themselves as well. For all of us complaining about the status of hip-hop, what are we doing to change it? Listening to Attack of the Attacking Things is almost like reading Joan Morgan’s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Although the outright feminist agenda is missing from Jean Grae’s album, the themes that come out in Morgan’s book about the need for change and the vulnerability of wanting to be loved are all there

Perhaps the most poignant representation of a hip-hop feminist state of mind and potential agenda comes across in the song “P.S.” from Grae’s latest CD, This Week. The song is a series of e-mails, which are basically apologies to people she has wronged in the past, a friend she betrayed, a lover she [90] cheated on, and herself. The song calls to mind the hip-hop feminist need to question our complicity in our oppression. She questions it and owns it. In the last verse she raps:Dear Jean
I see you’re doing big things
Congratulations, hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? LOL
You even seem content
I notice that you’re more focused
Drinking less as well
Anyways it’s been too many months having henny days
I think it’s plenty brave, plus you get your pennies saved up
And say what?!? Second album?
Whatever happened to the thought of ending rapping?
Still living in Manhattan?
Sidetracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I’ve acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you’re a big girl now
You’ve fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO Space Smiley Face dot dot dot
Comma Much Love, youThe fact that the speaker in this rap is writing this particular e-mail to her “self” is telling; it brings to mind many questions about how young black women internalize the negative influences bombarding them. Hip-hop feminist writings have dealt with some of these issues. What has been criticized as a self-absorption and an excessive focus on the individual in most hiphop feminist writings is really a genuine concern and a search for meaning, particularly what it means to be a young woman in often dangerous urban environments; what it means to be a woman who participates in and loves a culture that doesn’t always love you; and how you deal with it when some of the hatred aimed at you becomes internalized and affects how you treat others and how you feel about yourself. Jean Grae’s “P.S.” is all of those hip-hop feminist questions and issues put to music. And in a world where young black women grapple with so many images that objectify and sexualize them, such artistry is needed. I move now to a discussion of one of the most [91] problematic images that young women who listen to contemporary hip-hop face: the ride-or-die chick
Shorty Wanna Ride? Ride or Die Chicks and Real Black GirlsBut got a women that ain’t afraid
To tuck the toast in the escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade
But only for the Rule ’cause that’s my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don’t care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c’mon, follow me, and bust back at police
Conceal ya heat
-- Ja Rule, “Down Ass Bitch”Shorty, you ridin’ with me?
Stic tell ’em bought them RBGs
I like ’em real trill
Gold in the grill
Cold as Pam Grier swoll in the rear
Hard, smart, strong in the heart
Sexy thong when we alone in the dark
Dark skin, red bone, slim in the waist
Them legs so long
Queen earth, jean skirt, head wrapped up
Pimping them converse
And she down for the dirt
For better or for worse
Got my gun in her purse
In case a nigga get searched
She got a mind like Assata
A body like Trina
A heart like my momma
Nigga tell me have you seen her?
-- Dead Prez, “Real Black Girl (Revolutionary Love)”Finding a way to combine feminism and hip-hop in politically meaningful ways is one of the premier goals of hip-hop feminism. This is not easy work. The negative lyrics of most contemporary hip-hop are enough to make even the most die-hard hip-hop feminist contemplate giving up the music and the culture. Articles by dream hampton (2001) and Eisa Nefertari Ulen and Tara Roberts (2000) both speak volumes about the frustration of being a hip-hop head who is also a feminist. [92]

The fastest-growing prison population statistically in this country is black women. They are going to jail largely because of their relationships with men who are involved with criminal activities. They are going to jail for things like smuggling drugs; they are women like Kemba Smith, who simply fell in love with the wrong man and was too afraid to leave. As Smith recounts, “At age 24, without so much as a parking ticket on my record, I was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison—without parole. Technically, I was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, but I contend that I went to jail for dating a drug dealer.” She was finally pardoned as a last minute act of President Clinton, but she still feels that justice was not served. She notes, “You’d think I’d have been doing cartwheels when I was released. Truthfully, my feelings were in conflict. It was tough to leave behind the incredible women I met in prison—especially since many of them were victims of the same laws that put me away” (Booth 2001, 86). The incarceration rate for black women continues to grow because of the messages young women are getting from the videos. Messages from contemporary rap lyrics about being a “down ass chick” are everywhere, and they are not just coming from men. Women rappers also rap about the illegal things they would do for their men

In my book (Pough 2004), I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop, the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man, a girl that the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” call to mind. I urged black feminists in particular to look at these representations as a threat to young black womanhood and to find ways to have conversations with young women and reach out to them before we lose an entire generation. The situation was and still is that dire for me. However, I’d like to complicate things just a little by thinking about what I see as another version, albeit a revolutionary version, of the down ass chick. The recent revolutionary but gangsta messages from rap group Dead Prez have also included some interesting messages for what they call Real Black Girls—girls who are “down for the dirt, / for better or for worse, / got my gun in a purse / in case a nigga get searched.”

Given the hip-hop feminist fondness for all things ’70s and revolutionary, it is easy to see how a RBG (Real Black Girl/Revolutionary but Gangsta) image is more appealing than a Down Ass Chick. The reggae beat of the song and the reggae chant of the first stanza calls to mind those Black Panther sisters we see in all the footage of that time but never hear about. Or the revolutionary sisters who are still in prison as political prisoners for their acts against the establishment but whose names we have yet to learn, let alone start a Free (fill in the blank) Movement for. [93]

Now, I’m not going to argue that down ass chicks and real black girls are problematic for the same reasons. That’s not the point of the comparison. The point of the comparison is to look at the ways in which a mentality of being down for whatever—even when that whatever is revolution—can add to the growing black women prison rate. The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial, negative, and therefore bad, and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious, underground, revolutionary, and therefore good. The point isn’t to single out Dead Prez, because they do build on a legacy of the Black Power Movement that had its own gender issues to work out. Even though one would hope that in the twenty-first century conscious rappers would not be replicating those dated and retrograde ideas in such problematic ways. And even though I have no problem with the concept of doing what we have to do for the revolution, per se, I have to ask, if we are talking about a revolution, then what is my role in it, brother? Is a woman’s role in the revolution still pussy power and prone and now I have to conceal your weapon to boot? All of that aside, my point in using Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girl’s (Revolutionary Love)” as an example is simply to say that if we are pushing hip-hop feminism forward as a movement concerned with creating change in the culture and eventually change in the world, we cannot be one-sided with our critiques. Everyone gets called out if they need to be called out. Thinking about “Real Black Girls” as a derivative of the “Down Ass Chick” is one area that we could exam that would allow us to break apart some of the false dichotomies between conscious and commercial hip-hop

In her novel Picture Me Rollin’ (2005), Black Artemis tells the tale of a young woman who has been released from jail on a mandatory gun possession charge. The protagonist, Esperanza, was dating a street entrepreneur who dabbled in armed robbery when she got caught in the getaway vehicle with a gun that he gave her. She was the only one out of the crew to serve time, mainly as a lesson because she refused to testify—to snitch—against the guys. When the novel opens, Esperanza is being released from jail, and throughout the novel she grapples with several things. The first is “Thug Life,” an obsession with rapper 2Pac Shakur that is so delusional she thinks that the rapper is still alive and chilling in Cuba with Assata Shakur. The second is her newfound knowledge of women of color feminism, thanks to her older sister’s community college course books. And the third is her old life as a drug dealer and generic ride-or-die chick for her drug dealer boyfriend Jesus. Esperanza [94] tries throughout the novel to make a better life for herself, and Black Artemis does an excellent job of showing another side—a female side—of growing up in the urban environments and landscapes made famous by hip-hop

The character Esperanza offers some insight that we all need to consider as we grapple with and complicate the down ass chick. In the prologue to the novel, Esperanza is getting ready to be released from prison and is having a talk with fellow prisoner and roommate Isoke, a political prisoner jailed for her activity with the Black Liberation movement. Isoke is trying to get Esperanza to move beyond an embrace of 2Pac’s “Thug Life” in order to join the larger struggle. Isoke also works in the prison library, so she has given Esperanza a lot of things to read. At this point, however, if it isn’t related to 2Pac, Esperanza is not really interested in reading it. When Isoke flat-out asks her if she is going to be a thug or a revolutionary the older political prisoner lectures to Esperanza: “Because I’m afraid that brother 2Pac was wrong. Thug Life is not the new Black Power. It makes no sense to rage against the machine without purpose or principle. You cannot be both a gangsta and a soldier, Esperanza, so you must choose.” In response to this, Esperanza sighs and thinks “neither ’cause either way I’ll end up back in this muthafucka or dead.” When Esperanza speaks, she responds, “All I know is that I am never coming back here” (Artemis 2005, 2). Esperanza’s words bring the connection between the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” and Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girls” home in powerful ways. We can see that when it comes down to it, there really isn’t that much difference between the oppression and the limitations placed on women; that patriarchy in criminal circles is not better or worse than patriarchy in revolutionary circles; that patriarchy in gangsta rap is no worse or better than patriarchy in conscious rap

What the novel and the lyrics highlight to me is a real need for hip-hop feminism to be engaged with all aspects of black girls’ lives—we don’t want to be accused of being irrelevant to young black women in the ways that some of us have categorized academic black feminism. It makes no sense to pick and choose images and the artists who create the images and lyrics by deeming some negative and some positive, all the while creating false dichotomies. The issues and the artists are much more complicated than these simplistic readings allow. Rappers like 2Pac Shakur, Dead Prez, Common, Mos Def, and others are nothing if not complicated and sometimes conflicted young men. A cursory look at their work shows us that. Hip-hop feminism needs to be bolder in its critiques, even if it means calling out the so-called good guys every once and a while. [95]

Shorty Wrote this Book Yo!: Hip-hop and Feminism, Is it Fiction?

In her 2001 novel, The Haunting of Hip-Hop, author, lecturer, and scholar Bertice Berry tells the chilling tale of a Harlem brownstone haunted by souls tortured due to U.S. racism and oppression. One of the souls, a former enslaved African, has a message for the hip-hop generation: “We gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it’s being used to send the wrong message” (Berry 2001). The novel tells the story of rap producer Harry “Freedom” Hudson and his lawyer Ava Vercher

If Freedom represents hip-hop in the novel, then Ava represents the consciousness that echoes in hip-hop’s ear and tries to keep it on a righteous path. Ava Vercher is a new-age Afrocentric womanist with uplift tendencies. Freedom is a producer who makes two kinds of music: one is the kind of commercial music record companies want and the other is “music that no major record label would ever release because it was filled with the messages of love he longed for and the revolution he dreamed of starting” (Berry 2001, 16). You see that the ghost of the enslaved African has been haunting Freedom ever since he was a child, and he hopes to influence Freedom to do the right thing with the drum before it is too late

I’ve found the most compelling representations of hip-hop feminist representations in hip-hop literature. This is not to say that we should discount the music or the nonfiction writings of hip-hop feminists but simply to offer other spaces within hip-hop culture in which people are trying to imagine a better way. I closed Check It While I Wreck It with the call for us all to imagine a better way to use the culture of hip-hop to enact change. I believe that some women writers of popular fiction have begun to do just that

In the “Reader’s Guide: A Conversation with Black Artemis” at the end of her first novel Explicit Content, Black Artemis defines hip-hop fiction as fiction “about hip-hop as a subculture, as something that gives people voice and their lives meaning.” For her, “hip-hop is a form of cultural power and whether that power is a force for progress or destruction depends on how people use it, whether you use it on the street or in the studio, for fun or for profit, to build or destroy” (2004, 338). Of the recent trend to call urban fiction hip-hop fiction, she notes:I think that street life should be referred to as street life fiction, period, and that the term “hip-hop fiction” should be reserved for novels that are about hip-hop. Eventually, there’ll be some works that can be referred to as both, but something that has nothing to do with hip-hop subculture should not [96] be referred to as hip-hop fiction, especially if it perpetuates the myth that hip-hop is all about violence, drugs, misogyny, etc. These phenomena are not the sum total of hip-hop, and hip-hop is not the only subculture in which those elements exist so it is wrong to treat them as if they are one and the same. (2004, 339)Her distinction has caused me to rethink many of my earlier definitions about what constitutes hip-hop fiction and cinema. The distinction is necessary and important for those of us looking for ways to more fully use the youth culture to enact change. And it does not rely on a dichotomy of positive and negative, conscious and commercial. The work simply has to be about one of the elements of hip-hop culture to be classified as such

Black Artemis’s Explicit Content documents the story of two women rappers, one black and one Latina. The novel explores what it is like to be a female with rapping skills trying to gain recognition in the music industry. It follows the women into the world of hip-hop and examines their hopes and dreams. It’s also a novel about female friendship, with just enough drama to keep the average hip-hop head focused and interested. The two women are a rap duo to rival all rap duos until a gangsta rap label comes between them. Of her work Black Artemis notes, “in these times when hip-hop is often used as a cultural weapon of destruction, my mission as a hip-hop artist and activist is to tell stories that relay the power of hip-hop as a tool of transformative expression” (2004, 340). The activist in her comes across in her fiction. It is fiction with a mission; in the tradition of the poets and playwrights of the Black Arts Movement who created art for people’s sake, Black Artemis’s art has an activist goal and agenda in mind

Another writer who has political threads in her work is L. A. Banks. Her Vampire Huntress Legends focus on the life of spoken word artist and vampire huntress, Damali Richards. She is the Neturu, which means God’s divine power latent within humans. She is the only Neturu to span two millennia. Damali uses her art—her spoken word music—to bring the light. Her lyrics are about hope in a time of hopelessness. And her band is also her vampire hunting crew. When I asked Banks why she decided to write horror and focus on vampires, she replied: “I wrote this series because I’m a mother living in the urban environment—and horror, because I have been horrified by what I see on the nightly news, and hear on the trolleys and subways, and by what I read in the newspapers. Vampires—because they suck blood, in a metaphor, they suck the life-blood out of the community as predators, and really have no sense of mortality or moral compass. I [97] wanted to create a cautionary tale, but one that also delved into the social, economic, and political infrastructure within our own society that creates predators” (Pough 2005, 168). Each of the novels in the series uses art to highlight the pitfalls of excessive materialism. Each of the novels work as metaphors for the age-old fight between good and evil. However, by making Damali a young spoken word artist, Banks is making a huge statement about the power at hand for young women, the power to change the world. And as for hip-hop, she hasn’t given up hope. Banks notes, “I see plenty of room for Hip-hop as an awesome catalyst, and I’m not so ready to give up on all Hip-hop artists, their messages, or their lyrics. I think what has happened, as metaphorically alluded to in the novels, is that vampires have infiltrated the genre of music, have co-opted the culture, and have twisted it. But there are still some very young, savvy, ready-to-stand-for-their-beliefs young folk out there. . . . that’s the message, that’s my hope. . . . guess it’s really my prayer” (Pough 2005, 171). Like Black Artemis, L. A. Banks has a mission in her art, and that mission is in line with many of the goals that hip-hop feminists have set out. Their novels offer hope and a spark for hiphop culture, at least in terms of having a political mission aimed at change. Race, class, sex, gender, and the intersections of these are present in this new fiction in startling, surprising, and uplifting ways. Writers like L. A. Banks and Black Artemis, rappers like Jean Grae, and the hip-hop feminists that I have mentioned here can in varying degrees be seen as pushing the hip-hop feminist agenda forward. They represent—along with the video vixens and the women hip-hop heads who buy the music and support the culture—a small sampling of women in contemporary hip-hop culture. Together their stories offer versions of the truth that Joan Morgan suggests we could achieve. Together they also give us a glimpse at the possibility for change and a sign that hip-hop feminism just might be on the right path to what it is going to be at last. And then we might be a little less concerned with “what it do” because we would be so awed by all that the movement has done

Endnotes

1. I realize that the word “shorty” as a term that is often used to refer to women in hiphop culture and rap music is problematic. Although not as derogatory as some other terms, such as “chickenheads,” “bitch,” “ho,” and so forth, it is still a term that more often than not objectifies women. It is also a term in hip-hop culture that refers to younger people, often children. Because “shorty” is used within the culture to refer to women and children, [98] it can be argued that the term therefore infantilizes women; thus, it is not a term I use lightly. I use “shorty” throughout this essay because of its multiple meanings, because it showcases just how fraught the relationship between hip-hop and feminism is. And I also use it because it calls forth the generational issues between hip-hop feminists and older black feminism. In a sense, hip-hop feminists are the shorties, the next generation of feminists on the “come up” ready to continue the legacy of black women’s intellectual traditions and activism

2. Most of my information about the dreams and aspirations of video models and how much they make comes from a survey of the interviews and photo spreads I’ve read of in the Source Magazine’s monthly “Dime Piece” section and XXL’s monthly “Eye Candy” section. Each month these magazines pick a video girl to highlight. And while most of the “coverage” is the photo shoot of the scantly-clad woman, there is usually a two- to three-page write-up and interview of each girl. And it is in these limited spaces that we get their voices, hopes, and dreams

You
You
You are still a whisper on my lips
A feeling at my fingertips
That's pulling at my skin
You leave me when I'm at my worst
A feeling as if I've been cursed
Bitter cold within

Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Days go by and still I think of you
Days when I couldn't live my life without you
Without you
Without you

230,2002,Alan Jackson,Drive (For Daddy Gene),"[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive
[Outro]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke"

Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here

Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there

Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want
I made up my mind

Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of goin' non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday

I can do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key
A cash machine, gasoline, and we're outta here

Call it going off the deep end
Baby, you and me
We can leave it all behind

I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now

[Chorus:]
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

[Verse 2:]
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while

After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this

242,2002,Nickelback,Too Bad,"[Verse 1]
Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a café on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
(Let's talk)

[Verse 2]
You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad
[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
Let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

[Verse 3]
Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

[Chorus]
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk
[Outro]
Long time, let's walk, let's talk"
243,2002,Toby Keith,My List,"[Verse 1]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today like
[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Chorus 2]
Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

[Outro]
Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today"
244,2002,Nas,One Mic,"[Produced by Chucky Thompson and Nas]

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)"
245,2002,Tommy Shane Steiner,What If She's An Angel,"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?
What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel?"

A new day has come

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear
Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

[Verse 2]
I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, with your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true

Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe

While in their memories, tiny tragedies

I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)
Sticky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)
Sticky, icky, icky, icky (Oooh-Oooh!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
It's illegal but the plants in my backyard grow
That's my bud
Smoke 'til ya drop out, that's my luck
Keep a couple rolled and I hit the club
In the back door (NIGGA WHAT?!)
Act like I don't make clout
How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump, hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (They got that work?)
Don't it smell so good?
In Southwest where they rep that hood
Protect your chest, they up to no good
And come through flossin', they wish y'all would
[Hook: Ludacris] + (Sleepy Brown)
I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
Worldwide hustlers get that dough
Work that tip
Get rid of evidence, move that brick
Keep a D-Eagle with an extra clip
Think it ain't so? (SUCK A DICK!)
Act like I just do rap
How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?
Black El-Dorado, fifth wheel on back
Itchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock, I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops say ""freeze""
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed (You got a nose bleed?)
Don't it smell so sweet?
In Decatur, where we pack that heat
And rob neighbors in the night, creep, creep
I'll see you later when we in them streets

I gotta big weed stash, pocket full of cash
Just seen a big ol' ass (It's Saturday!)

Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 2: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath
[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet

Mmm, I was looking so good, I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was feeling so good, I had to touch myself

Mmm, I was eyeing my thighs, butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, comin' outta my shirt and then my skirt came down

See, I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
And I know you've been waiting too
For someone to love you

All you need is someone who cares (Someone to love you)
Someone who will always be there
All you need to say is that
You want me to be with you
Girl I know you waited so long
For someone to love you

Baby I wish I could be there
For every time you ever shed a tear
Baby I hate to see a pretty girl like you
Going through, the things that you do

Girl I think you've gone for far too long
Without a good man to make you smile
How can I appeal to you and make you understand
That I'm here when you're ready for
Someone to love you

Baby you've been waiting for the man from all the fairy tales
Or maybe just the man from all your dreams
Try to think reality, Lets talk possibilities

Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert into my soul

My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh, my heart is lost to you

Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment that hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by your gaze
There was some kind of magic led me away

Everything that matters, is, in this room

Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love

The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin' over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Hey man!)
Always flirtin' with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin' blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin' I got everything a country boy could ask for

Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin', but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

Said I'll be right back, don't trip
What if a woman
Left you home with the kids
Changing diapers and shit
What a twist

[Chorus]
Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile?
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile?
(I don't know a man who could)
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?
[Verse 2]
What if a woman
Started wearing the pants
Would you feel less of a man and more
What if a woman
Never wanna settle down
Always wanna run around on the low
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry
She won't be your wife
But your eyes are full of tears
She'll be running the streets
With girls hanging out tonight
It's the same thing you do to her

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If the table were turned around
Would you leave? Would you stay?
Would you drown?
If the cards you were dealt were to change
Would you let your hand go up in flames?

[Outro till fades]
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?"

To my mother, to my father
It's your son or, it's your daughter
Are my screams, loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you
[Chorus]
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

[Verse 2]
Your silence, is what kills me
I need someone, here to help me
But you don't know, how to listen
And let me make, my decisions

[Chorus]
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

[Verse 3]
All your insults, and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like, I am nothing
But you made me, so do something
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you are
Need attention, attention you couldn't give
[Chorus]
'Cause I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast"
269,2002,Kenny Chesney,The Good Stuff,"[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""
[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""
[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"""

Everything you do I wanna feel again

American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue
[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!

As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine

Yo, I go by the name (I'm yo' pusha)
Of Pharrell, from The Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know (I'm yo' pusha)
The world, is about to feel something (I'm yo pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the, neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

[Chorus: Pharrell]
(Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Grindin' (Ahh)
Huh-huh
[Verse 2: Malice]
Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

Grindin' (whoa)
You know what I keep in a lining (whoa)
Niggas better stay in line when (whoa)
You see a nigga like me shinin' (grinding!)

[Verse 3: Malice]
My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

[Verse 4: Pusha T]
I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed, I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick, my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in, whichever palm I'm holdin'
One'll leave you frozen
The other, noddin' and dozin', I'm grindin' Jack

Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

[Verse 2]
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over

Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep

Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck

The headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit

Just gimme a minute of your time, baby

Let me talk to these motherfuckers
Ugh!

Guess who's bizzack? You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nothing with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool!

Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)

Turn a whole one from a half a brick
Look, I mastered this, you can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch
Young'un, never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz (Huh)
And keep your whole hood on flip (Ugh)
Like old box-spring, pissy mattress shit
No, won't box a thing, strictly blasting shit
I hug the block like quarter-water (Ugh)
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
'Til, like, deuce in the morning
With the old heads (Ugh), slangin' loose quarters (Quarters)
This Philly cat back at it (At it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts, still busting with that black-matic

What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish, I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama, goodbye!
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin'
Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her, she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules, so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's got to know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists

Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond
Rollin' north on 95
With a sheriff right beside me
Pistol pointed at my side
Oh, Lord...such a disappointing ending
For this modern day Bonnie and Clyde
Yeah...

Whoa
Well...
Woo...hoo"
294,2002,Joe Nichols,The Impossible,"[Verse 1]
My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

[Pre-Chorus]
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Verse 2]
Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again
[Pre-Chorus]
But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

[Bridge]
So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible"

All the time on a creep, first class flights
Seas in sights, all night
Never thought that this could take control of me

Day and night, I don't know what to do
Always on my mind and dreaming of you
It feels so right but I know it is wrong
That I know I gotta man, just can't leave you alone

So many nights on the scene
Buying me, shopping sprees, diamond rings
All the things that I can't get at home
Never could understand a thing like me
To utter this from the seen of your face
I'm caught up in love with my secret love

300,2003,50 Cent Featuring Nate Dogg,21 Questions,"Hi, I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Ja Rule. Now, as previously stated in another episode, Ja Rule was the biggest rapper out for a while in the early 2000's. Platinum records, features, number one singles, babes, bucks, Ja Rule had it all. But, as time went on, people noticed a pattern with him, which was the constant usage of the ""thugs need love too"" formula to make hit songs, and for a long time, he was on top with it. Hit song after hit song, his ""pop gangster"" persona was blowing up, but then, there came a man who saw fit to call out this ""pop rapper"" for what he felt that he was: ""a studio thug"" who purely used his hardcore image to appeal to a female audience. That man was Mr. Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent. He'd call out Ja for not being a heartless thug, and instead being a punk, a softie! *footage of 50 calling out Ja* Sure, there's some origin about 50's friend stealing his chain and Ja Rule seeing that dude and 50 hanging out, but the main thing that people heard about was 50 calling him out for being a fake gangster, and sure enough, when 50 cent came into prominence, he would stamp out all of Ja Rule's club songs and love song, and replace them with… *""In Da Club"" and ""21 Questions""*… with club songs and love songs… Well, to 50's credit though, he did explain himself when releasing ""21 Questions"", the love song I wanted to look at today

When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""

50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity

And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?

*""Rider, Part 2""*

Oh yeah, yeah…

So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!

But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares

*intro*

Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?

*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*

*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money

*police arrive*
Oh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!

*cops come in, song starts*

*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*

""New York City! You are now riding… with 50 Cent!

Well, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour

You gotta love it!

Personally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever

I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745

I just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!

Girl, it's easy to love me now

And, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
And I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch"". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?

And he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car, smoking weed"" nonsense

If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

You know, for most ""thugs need love too"" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it

If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?

Also, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about

If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

Okay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...

I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive

Okay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it

I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside

Yeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?

Would that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?

Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?

Uh… does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?

Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?

Now THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---

I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans

…and… and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, ""Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS… also, ya dreams, and shit...

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see

Okay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yeah, this always got to me. He says, ""If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him."" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER

Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!

Yeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids

I love you like a fat kid loves cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

Yeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling

We're only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you lil a fat kid loves cake

And THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me

Overall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play ""Always On Time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song

*""Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!""*

Well, I'm the Rap Critic: You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your song"

But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
[Verse 2: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
You ain't never step outta line or get outta pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
[Verse 3: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Uh
Uh-oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gon' kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly, uh
You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you, yeah)
These feelings I'ma share wit' you
Which makes it a little more clear for you

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

[Verse 2: Amy Lee]
Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become
[Bridge: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside

Frozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Get the position down pat, then it's time to switch
I'll rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up
.. and I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin up a sweat strokin

You can call your mama right now, tell her you met a thug

My left stroke's the death stroke

'Cause my head game have you head over heels
Give a nigga the chills, have him pay my bills
Buy matchin Lambo's with the same color wheels
And I ain't out shopping spending dudes C-notes
I'm in the crib giving niggas deep throat
Tonight Lil' Kim gon' have you in the zone
Girls, call ya crib, I'm answering the phone
Guys wanna wife me and give me the ring
I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the ""Drugs"", baby, I'm makin ya high!

If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""

Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love

[Hook: Beyoncé]
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh no no

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
[Chorus: Beyoncé & JAY-Z]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (So crazy, your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Oh, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Geah!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Geah!)
I'm looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Whoo!)
Got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z & Beyoncé]
Young Hov, y'all know when the flow is loco (No)
Young B and the R-O-C, uh-oh (Oh, no)
O.G. Big Homie, the one and only (No, no)
Stick bony, but the pockets is fat like Tony (No, no, no)
Soprano, the ROC handle like Van Exel
I shake phonies man you can't get next to
The genuine article, I do not sing though
I sling though, if anything, I bling yo
A star like Ringo, war like a Green Beret
You crazy? Bring your whole set (Oh)
JAY-Z in the Range, crazy and deranged
They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur - chinchilla
I've been iller than chain smokers
How you think I got the name Hova?
I been realer, the game's over
Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Got me looking, so crazy, my baby
I'm not myself lately, I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care
'Cause your love's got the best of me
And baby, you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me
You got me so crazy, baby (Hey!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Looking crazy)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Baby, your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Yeah, babe)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Oh)
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking (Yeah)
Got me looking so crazy in love (Whoa)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (Your love)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now
Looking so crazy, your love's got me looking
Got me looking so crazy in love"

Long hair with your big fat booty
Back in the days, you was a girl I went to school with
Had to tell your moms and sister to cool it
The girl wanna do it, I just might do it
Hit her up with some pimp-pimp fluid

Hurry up and finish so we can watch Clueless

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh
[Verse 2]
Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game, aha
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

I remembered

Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter"

If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope, I love you all my life
[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

[Bridge]
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?"

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

[Verse 2]
Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open the door)
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love is true

[Bridge]
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise (Surprise), it's time
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

[Verse 2]
You and I had many conversations on the telephone
Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table
But all of that just seems so far away from me
Had to wake up, face reality
It all just seem too good to be true after all you put me through
[Pre-Chorus]
And now you're tryna tell me that you're sorry
And you're tryna come back home
You're tellin' me you really need me crying
Beggin' both knees are on the floor
But baby, I

[Chorus]
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight
And say the things that hurt too bad to where we both begin to cry
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough
It's been a rough road, baby, just let it go
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more
Tell me what's the use of holdin' on when all we do is hurt our love

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, oh
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try
Don't wanna try no more
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, don't wanna try no more

325,2003,Tyrese,How You Gonna Act Like That,"[Verse 1]
It seems like just the other day that we hooked up
(I was drivin', you was walkin' and I swooped you up)
From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced)
How you gonna?

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

[Verse 2]
Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts
(Like before I put the down on the house we bought)
Now I'm thinkin' you and me was a mistake
(But then it hits me and I'm missin' all the love we made)
Girl, I know that we've been goin' through some things, yeah
(But the sun is somewhere shinin' even when it rains, oh)
[Break]
I'll be the one you kick it to
I'll be the one that misses you
I'll be the one to ease your pain
I'll be the one you won't forget
And you'll be the one I can't forget
You'll be the one that's Heaven sent
You'll be the one I can't deny
You'll be the one that makes me cry, baby

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave me now? (Why you do)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta act like this?)

[Bridge]
You know I'm willin' to do anything
Just to keep you in my heart (Keep you in my heart)
I messed around and gave up everything
I thought we'd never part (Yes, I did, baby)
I was a player and made the choice to give my heart to you
And I gotta keep it that way, ooh, baby

How you gonna up and leave me now? (Ooh, baby)
How you gonna act like that? (Why you gotta treat me this way?)
How you gonna change it up? (Why you treat me wrong?)

327,2003,Lonestar,My Front Porch Looking In,"[Intro]
Ooh, yeah
Woo, yeah
Yeah oh yeah

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

[Bridge]
I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out
[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk
(From my front porch looking in)
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah
(Beautiful girl)

328,2003,Eminem,Sing For The Moment,"[Verse 1: Eminem]
These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away"

In a high-tech digital world

They say Ms. J's big butt is boss
Kate Moss can't find a job
In a world of post-modern fad
What was good now is bad

I promise it won't be in vain

It will lead you in the right direction

It's easy to find, just follow your heart, baby

Follow your heart, your intuition
It will lead you in the right direction
Let go of your mind, your intuition
It's easy to find, just follow your heart, baby

Follow your heart, your intuition
It will lead you in the right direction
Let go of your mind, your intuition

330,2003,Randy Travis,Three Wooden Crosses,"[Verse 1]
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Verse 2]
That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
[Bridge]
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me""

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway"

Gone a moment from my sight
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time were holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die, your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends, if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity

Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever in the heart of me
I would hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most
See that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe

There are more than angels watching over me

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Baby, I want the whole world to see
(I want the whole world to see)
Just how good your love looks on me

[Chorus]
I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop
Baby, scream and shout
I wanna sing it on the radio
Show it on a video
Baby, leave no doubt
I want the whole world to know (World to know)
Just what I'm all about
I love to love you
Baby, I love to love you out loud
[Outro]
I love to love you out loud"
335,2003,Amanda Perez,Angel,"[Verse 1]
It's been five months since you went away
You left without a word and nothing to say (Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no
So I asked God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (Is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

[Verse 2]
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)
[Bridge]
Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love (give you all my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now, but you can't have it
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel (Send me an angel)
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God, send me (God send me an angel)
An angel (Wipe the tears from my eyes)
Oh baby
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel (God send me an angel)
From being in love (Send me an angel)
Oh God, send me an angel
Send me an angel (Send me an angel)
Ooohhhh"
336,2003,Coldplay,Clocks,"[Verse 1]
The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh I beg, I beg and plead
Singin', come out of things unsaid
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin', come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

[Chorus]
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are
You are

And nothing else compares
Oh, nothing else compares
And nothing else compares

337,2003,Audioslave,Like A Stone,"[Verse 1]
On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone"

What am I gonna do?
Said I've been needing you (Said I'm needing you)
Wondering if you're the same and who's been with you
Is your heart still mine, I wanna cry sometimes
I miss you

[Verse 1]
Off to college, yes, you went away
Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now

Come back to me, can you feel me calling?
Hear me calling for you, for you, 'cause it's

Now I'm sitting here, thinking 'bout you
And the days we used to share
It's driving me crazy, I don't know what to do
I'm just wondering if you still care

I know you got another life you gotta concentrate, baby

340,2003,Chris Cagle,What A Beautiful Day,"Day One
I stumbled through hello on 5th Avenue
Day Two
We grabbed a bite to eat and talked all afternoon
Caught a movie on Day Fourteen
And Day Sixty-Seven she said ""I love you"" to me

Chorus:
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One Sixteen
I asked her what she was doing for the rest of my life
Day One Eighty Nine
Oh, I almost lost that girl to my foolish pride
But she said ""I do"" on day Four Eighty Two
And gave me a son on day Seven Sixty One
Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day

Day Eighteen Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty Three
Well, Honey that's fifty years
Yeah, here's to you and me

Oh, what a feeling
What a wonderful emotion
Yeah, what a life
Counting my blessings and knowing...
Ooh we had our ups and downs
All along the way
She had a chance to leave, but chose to stay

What a beautiful day
What a beautiful day

Day One, I thank God I said ""Hello"" on 5th Avenue"
341,2003,Keith Urban,Raining On Sunday,"[Verse 1]
It ticks just like a Timex
It never lets up on you
Who said life was easy
The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

[Chorus]
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

[Verse 2]
Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls
[Chorus]
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain"
342,2003,Jimmy Wayne,Stay Gone,"I've found piece of mind
I'm feeling good again
I'm on the other side
Back among the living
Ain't a cloud in the sky
All my tears have been cried
And I can finally say

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I still love you
And I will forever
We can't hide the truth
We know each other better
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone
When we try to make it work
We both end up hurt
Love ain't supposed to be that way

So Baby, Baby stay
Stay right where you are
I like it this way
It's good for my heart
I haven't felt like this
Oh, In God knows how long
I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone

I know everything's going to be okay
If you just stay gone..."

346,2003,Darryl Worley,Have You Forgotten?,"I hear people sayin'. We don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?!"
347,2003,Nas,I Can,"[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

349,2003,Avril Lavigne,I'm With You,"[Verse 1]
I'm standin' on the bridge
I'm waitin' in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, mmm

[Verse 2]
I'm lookin' for a place
I'm searchin' for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone
[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone tryin' to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh, why is everything so confusing?
Maybe I'm just out of my mind
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah

It's a damn cold night
Tryin' to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new?
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand, take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you

Check me out!

(Chorus)
Have you ever seen the thug in the club with a bottle turned up
Head bobbin' like HELL YEAH!
Have you ever seen the chick in the club with a drinkin the cup
Booty shakin' like HELL YEAH!
Have you seen those Big Tymers pull up in the front of the club
24's like HELL YEAH!
Have you ever seen 50 thousand strong with their hands in the air
Up and down like HELL YEAH!

So fresh, so fly, so sweet, so polite
So much, too many, but we ridin' tonight
Well, it's that pimp talk that ain't that pimp walk
It's big pimpin' over here, player, that just started
See, we fresh with Air Ones, Lexus and big drums
(Chips, Plenty Chicks, Plenty crisp, big fun)
Ma, you worry none, the minks come with the guns
Prada, the Gucci, it's all in Bird fun
(Ginuwine)
I'm sittin' in my truck, snakin' the club out
Kill this sip then go wild the f*** out
Up in the club with my hands in the air
There's so much coochie in the atmosphere
So girl, quit frontin' and get you're a** over here
And get yourself a cup of this Crown and Belvedere
I'm all off in the corner with honeys takin' pics
They be in the VIP with lots of chicks
I'm pimped out now, low cut, and a pick
G and Big Tymers together, that's a hit

(Chorus)
(Ginuwine)
So fresh, so clean, so shiny, on a beam
Girl, you're so mean, why you're doin' a damn thing
Any more room for me in those jeans
Uh-huh, uh-huh
We got so many rooms in the Swiss like we were Swiss sailors
Mami, givin' me head like she's a brain doner
A pool party in my crib up in Daytona
Hosted by Sonia and Monya, ooh

(Baby)
Mami, walkin' up the beach, so fly, so neat
It's me and Ginuwine, 23's on our feet
Say mami, you look good, mami, you're so fly
You need a D-Boy, come over here and get superfly
(Chorus)

Said we love them cars and we love them chicks
And we love them parties and we love that Cris'
And we love them houses and we love that ice
And when we rollin' through your hood we love to shoot that dice

352,2003,Linkin Park,Somewhere I Belong,"[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

Soon as the beat drop, we got the streets locked
Overseas, at Panjabi MC and the Roc
I came to see the mamis in the spot
On the count of three, drop your body like it's hot
1, Young, 2, You 1,2,3
Young Hov's a snake charmer, move your body like a snake mama
Make me wanna put the snake on ya
I'm on my 8th summer, still hot -- Young's the 8th wonder
All I do is get bread, yeah I take Wonder
I take one of your chicks straight from under your armpit
The black Brad Pitt, I mack 'til six in the AM
All day I'm P-I-M-P, I am simply
Attached to the track like SMPTE
It's simply good, Young Hov, infinitely hood

Ma, I ain't gotta tell you, but it's ya boy Hov
From the U.S., you just lay down slow
Catch ya boy mingle in England, meddling in the Netherlands
Checking in daily under aliases
We rebellious, we back home, screaming, ""Leave Iraq alone!""
But all my soldiers in the field, I will wish you safe return
But only love kills war when will they learn
It's international Hov, been having a flow
Before Bin Laden got Manhattan to blow
Before Ronald Reagan got Manhattan the blow
Before I was cabbing it there back and forth
Raw we had it all day, Papi in the hallway
Cop one on consignment to give you more yay
Yea, but that's another stor-ay
But for now, mami, turn it around and let the boy play (Jay)

I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch

Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed
That's what I need
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
I'm tired of spinning my wheels"

A different motive in your eyes

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada

She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

361,2003,Heather Headley,I Wish I Wasn't,"[Verse 1]
I'm home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
It's getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish,I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

[Chorus]
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

[Verse 2]
When you touch me my heart melts
And everything you did wrong I forget
So you play me and take advantage of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms. Oooh baby
I wish, I could go back
To the day before we met and skip my regret
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feeling all that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
Yet you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no, no, no,more

[Chorus x 2]

[Outro]
Hear you knockin' at the door again
I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me
So
Beautiful in your hand
Please stop begging me to take you back
I've always been a sucker for romance
And before you know
It I concede
You're all over me
Oh no here I go again
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me"
362,2003,Jason Mraz,The Remedy (I Won't Worry),"[Verse 1]
Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

[Chorus]
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words

I won't worry my life away

When I fall in love (I fall in love), I take my time
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says the comedy is that it's serious
This is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend

So shine the light on all of your friends

363,2003,Brooks & Dunn,Red Dirt Road,"[Verse 1]
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road
[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Bridge]
I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road
Yes, I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends

364,2003,Train,Calling All Angels,"[Verse 1]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
[Bridge]
When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want
Is only what we want until it's ours

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

And I'm calling all angels

He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, ""Old man are you OK?""

[Chorus]
He said, ""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home""

[Verse 2]
Then he said, ""I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, ""Son, hurry up""
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck

Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been""

""Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree

Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home""

I said ,""Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission""
He said, ""Boy, if you'd've left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'""

She's my kind of rain

She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

367,2003,Kenny Chesney,Big Star,"[Verse 1]
She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered someday

[Pre-Chorus]
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2]
She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus]
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small-time town was hers
[Verse 3]
She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is
Where they are and where she is now

[Verse 4]
All her old neighbors swear they're certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going
Unless you got something they have not got

[Pre-Chorus]
So she sings tonight to twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man, that could be us

[Chorus]
She's a big star as she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star"
368,2003,Jeff Bates,The Love Song,"First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold

Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove

And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...

Where you from?
What's your name?
Wanna go to my game?
Got the keys to my dad's old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love....

The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasn't livin for myself
I knew i wasn't fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more...
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do...

Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldn't talk
Couldn't breathe...
My heart had me all choked up
Said ""I do,""
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love....

Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said ""It's time to watch your miracle arrive.""

Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love......"

I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, ahh!

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin 'bout ""What kinda shits he on?""
You disappear like ""Poof, bitch be gone!""
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!
[Hook: Ludacris]
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
[Hook: Ludacris]
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
[Hook: Ludacris]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems!
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

If money grew on hackberry trees
If time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
That'd be alright
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
That'd be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright

[Verse 2]
Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
That'd be alright
If my dear old dog never got old
If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
That'd be alright

Yeah, that'd be alright

All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass
Ain't no half steppin', she strapped with a nice weapon

He wore that cowboy hat
To cover up his horns
Sweet talkin' forked tongue
Had a tempting charm

Before I turned around
That girl was gone
All I can say is
Bartender pour me something strong

Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world
That angel who did me in

I think the devil drives a Coupe de Ville
I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will
And I've got time to kill
Down in Brokenheartsville

It was long and chrome
Sittin' in the lot
And fire engine red
That thing was hot

[Bridge]
He revved it up
She waved goodbye
Well, love's gone to hell
And so have I

Here's to the past
They can kiss my glass
I hope she's happy with him
Here's to the girl
Who wrecked my world

You gotta, you gotta well, ya gotta light a J
You gotta puff a J on this one [inhales]
You can't even drink Crist-OWL on this one
You gotta drink Crist-ALL
Buy some red wine, a little Gaja 9-7
You're so contagious, I can't take it
This is for the grown and sexy, uhh
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
Yeah, can I get my grown man on for one second?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be hanging with Jay-Z, Jay-Z
So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?
Can you come, hang with me? (Ooh, oh)
Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it

You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Gotta throw on Scooby Doo's, hehehehe
Have my baby, let's just make it
Excuse me; what's your name? Ooh, oh
This for the grown and sexy, only for the grown and sexy
So hot to trot, lady, what's your name? Ooh, oh
Woo!
You're so foxy girl.. you're so hot to trot

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one
You can easily get past, but that chapter is done
...but I'm done readin' for now
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role
I'm 'bout to give you all the keys and security codes
'Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin'
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?

Sex-cuse me, damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it

Tal vez sera que esa historia ya tiene final
No se porque hoy te siento tan distante de mí
Que a pesar que lo intento de nuevo
Tal vez llegue tarde, ya no hay nada que hacer
Y no puedo creer que el tiempo que hemos tenido tal vez se nos gastó

[Chorus]
Tal vez fui yo que no te dio una noche entera
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas
Tal vez no te escuche,Tal vez me descuide
Tal vez se me olvido que yo te amaba

[Verse 2]
Tal vez será que por ahora ya no hay nada que hablar
Tal vez esta vez necesitamos tiempo para pensar
Y yo por mi parte propongo intentarlo de nuevo,volver a empezar
Que por más que lo pienso no encuentro una sola razón para seguir sin tí

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tal vez me sorprendio la vida por la espalda
Y tira y tira y se rompió la cuerda
Tal vez nunca entendí lo que eras para mí
Tal vez yo nunca supe a quien amaba

By the time I hit the door I saw hoes on the floor
Niggas dressed in suits trickin' all they dough
Me? I'm a pimp, I ain't paying for no sex
Man I'd rather buy a car or a new Rolex
'Cause I got street fame so hoes flock like birds
I got one holdin' the weed, I got one holdin' the syrup
When I hit the club, I'ma be with David Banner
A thug ass nigga with bad table manners
We act bad, my nigga what is y'all saying?
Like when we walk inside clubs niggas hold they gal hand
Cause they know we run trains (choo! choo!) all night

381,2003,Martina McBride,Concrete Angel,"[Verse 1]
She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace

[Verse 2]
The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

[Verse 3]
Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When mornin' comes it'll be too late
[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

[Verse 3]
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel"

Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

Says ""Leave it alone""

Don't want to hear about it

And I will sing no more

And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me ""Go back home""

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now, ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin'
Ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy, still heavy in this game—can you feel me?
Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, WESTSIDE!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen', many peers dead; nigga, still ballin'

[Chorus: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
Still ballin' until I die (Until I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (They wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'
[Verse 2: Trick Daddy]
Now as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When these guns involved, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin' (I'm sayin')
But when these kids go to spray 'em, boy, won't be playin'
With clientele, any rhyme sells
Question is: will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em ""Thug Life"" was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

[Chorus: 2Pac]
'Til the day I die
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to their graves
Watch! Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
‘Cause Trick don't give a fuck
Where you coward niggas now?
Blast, keep pumpin', ain't worried about nothin'
Busters thought we was frontin'
So reload and keep dumpin'; still ballin'
[Chorus: 2Pac & (Trick Daddy)]
(I'm still ballin') 'til the day I die ('til I die)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' (I be ballin')
Niggas wonder why (They wonder why)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin' 'til the day I die (Still ballin')
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why (Tell 'em!)
You can bring your crew, but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', until the day I die

Same color chocolate
Same nigga pop shit, same nigga got shit
Loon ain't no lame, Loon never gossip
Nigga Loon in the game cause Loon got some hot shit
Sick of you cats screaming out block shit
I done sold numerous drugs and drew the block sick
Look at me now, pull up in the drop six
Bitch in your block looked at my watch and she got sick
Look at her now, all up in the cock pit
Rolling my windows up to get a kid top quick
Loon is a pimp, trick ain't the topic?
Nigga you do the shrimp, trip to the tropics
That's not my steez, not like me
It's not the way I wanna blow my cheese, like I blow my trees
The whole world know I need, a girl that'll curl my toes for me

How you want that? Tell me how you want that
How you want that? Tell me how you want that
Daddy how you want to give it to me
A Bad Boy is what I need

Less confusion, party with Puff last conclusion
Grab shorty there wit the hair, ass is huge and
Lips is juicy, way she move her hips so loosely
Critical curves see it through furs
Curious so I want to see if it's hers
Delirious so I had to see if it's her (it wasn't me)
I ain't touch you that's on me and my words
You ain't gotta flip the script, kick me to the curb
Cause I was, just checking you wasn't disrespecting you
Lips so sexual while your friend's protecting you
Baby girl I know you're far from a slut
I know the difference between a car and a truck
I'm not a dumb nigga
You had these young niggas scarring you up
You know the difference between a scar and a cut
You're not a dumb nigga
So let's take it from the car to the club
And hit the bar and get a bottle of bub, and have fun nigga

Baby all bubble, have a lil chat a small huddle
Time to make money and more trouble
And we all hungry and all hustle
And we all humble, but together we got more muscle
And we got dough, nigga me and P we hot yo
Make a hip hop show look like a rock show
Ooh Jesus Christ! look the way that the rocks glow
Want the world to see so we keeping them tops low
Rascal, keep it on my lap for Broscoe
One shot your blood drip thicker than Basco
Drop though, keep the illest cat wit the hot flow
Watch your pro turn grown men to a snot nose
I pity a fool, never touch titties in schools
Son you can't hang wit Diddy and Loon

Got more broads than you and any nigga in your crew, Bad Boy

Last night, I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing
Feet were pacing
Lord, help me please
Tell me what I have gotten into

Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out
It's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually

[Chorus:]
I'm on a emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

It's emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me (for me)
But I can't get off

[Verse 2:]
Yesterday, I told myself
I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day
Be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me
Mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being
Taken for a constant ride on your

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know
That you'll never keep
Round and round it goes

Yeah...
Here we go...

[Verse 1]
It's a new day, but it all feels old
""It's a good life!"" That's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be

[Chorus]
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 2]
""Go to college or university
Get a real job!"" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be

[Chorus]
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again

You, don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up

This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

I'm wiser now

Yes I'm going to take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

I am not afraid to try it on my own

Flipside and she my baby mama
Get wild, okay
Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops, it's the Roc in your area
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area
Yeah, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak
In the building like Trojans in Troy
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate
Flipside crack house and a little bit of bass

Get wild park keys and a little bit of cheese

Tell that hoe until she roll on a pole I'm tryna squeeze
With ease then breathe
(With ease, then breathe)
I ain't Hov', I just know what I know
I'm talkin' owe Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills
I, can't deny how the mamis feel
Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl
P. Crakk and I ain't for play
I got a mack that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact
P I M P U P H O E S is all the rest
And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us

Pass her the thing, tell her make it go ring
The prince of S.P., is soon to be the king

Now how many hoes in your motherfuckin group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delk
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, ""Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth""
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
'Cuz the heat call me a liar
She just like 'Honey' so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch

Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End

Worth your weight, the gold of meditation

404,2004,Hoobastank,The Reason,"[Verse 1]
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

And the reason is you
And the reason is you
And the reason is you

A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

A side of me you didn’t know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you"

[Verse 1: Twista]
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""Oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right

You see, see baby girl

You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for

406,2004,Maroon 5,This Love,"[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore"
407,2004,Alicia Keys,If I Ain't Got You,"[Verse 1]
Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
[Pre-Chorus]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Outro]
If I ain't got you with me, baby
Ooh, ooh
Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby"
408,2004,Usher,Confessions Part II,"[Intro]
Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions
[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, ""One second, baby, please hear me""

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please
[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions"

Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but

412,2004,J-Kwon,Tipsy,"[Intro]
Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
[Verse 3]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.

Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

413,2004,D12,My Band,"[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these
[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band
Baby, yeah

[Refrain: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
Alright, alright, alright, give me the mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back
[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & Eminem]
Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem, & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem & Bizarre]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

[Refrain: Bizarre]
Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new singer—

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band, my band (Roxanne Shanté, you lesbian)
Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world, D12!
[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa

Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 1]
I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc
[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 2]
Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real
[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

[Verse 3]
Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?
[Chorus]
If you feeling like a pimp
Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off
Niggas is crazy, baby, don't forget that boy told you
Get, that, dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get that dirt off your shoulder

415,2004,Evanescence,My Immortal,"[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me
[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Bridge]
I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

[Chorus/Outro]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me
Ah, me, ah, me, ah"

Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate
Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
[Verse 2]
Victoria Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Wal-Mart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me

[Pre-Chorus]
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""

On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country

Like me

My dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

[Chorus]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 2]
My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home
[Chorus 2]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 3]
Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, you make me proud

[Chorus 3]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause ain't nothin' funny when a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home"

(Right?)
Nah, I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your hair
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only 21, sitting on mills

We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot

(Ugh)
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't sparing a quarter<
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

Why carry on without me?

Why you gave me that kiss

I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

429,2004,OutKast Featuring Sleepy Brown,The Way You Move,"[Intro]
Boom, boom, boom
Ha-ha!

[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Ready for action, nip it in the bud
We never relaxing, OutKast is everlasting
Not clashing, not at all
But see, my nigga went to do a little acting
Now, that's for anyone asking, give me one pass 'em
Drip-drip-drop, there goes an eargasm
Now you cumming out the side of your face
We tapping right into your memory banks—thanks!
So click it or ticket, let's see your seat belt fastened
Trunk rattling, like two midgets in the backseat 'rassling
Speakerboxxx vibrate the tag
Make it sound like aluminum cans in the bag
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?
But I know y'all wanted that 808
Can you feel that B-A-S-S bass?

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
The whole room fell silent, the girls all paused with glee
Turning left, turning right, are they looking at me?
Well I was looking at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middle, feeling like a manwhore
Especially the big girl
Big girls need love too, no discrimination here, squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny-slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them
Give them something to remember
Yell out ""Timber!"" when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath and exhale
Your ex-male friend/boyfriend's boring as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho
[Hook: Sleepy Brown]
I like the way you move
I like the way you move, wooo

Hey, baby, girl, don't you stop it
Come on, lady, dance all around me
(Look so fine) You look so fine (Look so fine)
You driving me out of my, out of my mind
Out my mind, ooooh, baby
If I could, I would just be with you, baby
Oooh, 'cause you light me, and excite me
And you know, you got me baby, woo!

Fumbling his confidence
And wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, fly

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside

Dreaming about Providence
And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?
Somewhere we live inside
Somewhere we live inside
We were meant to live for so much more
Have we lost ourselves?

We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than this world's got to offer
We want more than the wars of our fathers
And everything inside screams for second life, yeah

Chasing the years of my life

Watching every motion in my foolish lover's game
On this endless ocean, finally lovers know no shame, oh
Turning and returning to some secret place inside
Watching in slow motion as you turn around and say

Watching, I keep waiting, still anticipating love
Never hesitating to become the fated ones, oh yeah

Take my breath away, oh-oh, yeah
Oh yeah""

In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed, I called you
And turned to hear you say
""If only for today, I am unafraid""

Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control

440,2004,Montgomery Gentry,If You Ever Stop Loving Me,"My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is ""bring it on""
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me
I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

That's alright
I'm okay

And all I know is I don't want to ever see the end
Baby please, I'm reaching out for you
Won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Oh, here I am
I'm reaching out for you
So won't you open up your heart and let me come back in
Let's be us again
Oh let's be us again"

Save me from this prison
Lord, help me get away

I've been waiting all day here for ya babe
So won't you come and sit and talk to me
And tell me how we're gonna be together, always?
Hope you know that when it's late at night
I hold on to my pillow tight
And think of how you promised me forever

(I never thought that anyone) Mmh
Could make me feel this way, uh
(Now that you're here, boy, all I want)

It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone

How I bought all the lies
You said that you would treat me right
But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)
[Verse 2]
Tell me why you're looking so confused
When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
How could you ever be so cold?
To go behind my back and call my friend
Boy, you must have gone and bumped your head
Because you left her number on your phone

Maybe I'm the one to blame, but
(To think that you could be the one)
Well, it didn't work out that way

I wanted you right here with me
But I have no choice, you've gotta leave
Because my heart is breakin'
With every word I'm sayin'
I gave up everything I had
On somethin' that just wouldn't last
But I refuse to cry
No tears will fall from these eyes
Oh, oh
Get out!

Get out (leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me (You and me)
It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone (You to be gone)

You said that you would treat me right

Get out (leave!) right now
It's the end of you and me (Hey, yeah!)
It's too late (now!) and I can't wait for you to be gone (You got to go)

Sometimes it feels like this world's spinning faster
Than it did in the old days
So naturally, we have more natural disasters
From the strain of a fast pace
Sunday was a day of rest
Now, it's one more day for progress
And we can't slow down (and we can't slow down) 'cause more is less ('cause more is less)
It's all an endless process

Sometimes I can hear this old earth shoutin'
Through the trees, as the wind blows
That's when I climb up here on this mountain

To get me high up here
Above the noise and city streets
My worries disappear

Sun tanned toes tickling the sand
Cold drink chilling in my right hand
Watchin' you sleep in the evening light
Resting up for a long, long night

Because when the sun goes down, we'll be grooving
When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right
When the sun sinks down over the water
Everything gets hotter when the sun goes down

All day long just takin' it easy
Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before
Cause when the sun goes down, we'll be back for more

When the sun goes down, we'll be feeling all right

Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet

I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)

So I zoomed off

Break fast through the middle just to see her smile and giggle
Game over, I approached her with a kiss on the cheek
The homeboys looking at me saying, Lil' Howard you weak'
But you know how that go
What I got they want, what I got I flaunt
Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too
I'm like, ""Yeah boo, I can't see me without you""
Got there, I took a shower, jumped out she in the bed
With a see-through thong set, I looked at her and said

448,2004,Keith Urban,You'll Think Of Me,"[Verse 1]
I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

[Bridge]
Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

And you're going to think of me

Ooh someday baby, someday

Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both sixteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night

There's a place on the corner of Cherry Street
We would walk on the beach in our bare feet
We were both eighteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

There's a piece of you that's here with me
It's everywhere I go, it's everything I see
When I sleep, I dream, and it gets me by
I can make-believe that you're here tonight
That you're here tonight

If I could find you now things would get better
We could leave this town and run forever
I know somewhere, somehow we'll be together
Let your waves crash down on me and take me away

I remember the look in your eyes
When I told you that this was goodbye
You were beggin' me, not tonight
Not here, not now

And keep pretendin' the sun will not rise (Ooh)
We'll be together for one more night (Ooh)

But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie

I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca

You sure know how to make a man say, ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say, ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Line it up 'till you spoiled
And have those other chicks throwin' vomit up
When they can't find it up in the mall
Like most men, I love to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But I'mma be straight for before it's too late for it
I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, ""Oh""

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Slow)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang (Yeah)
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh"" (Oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow (You can)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out (Oh) let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh"" (Oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh"""
454,2004,JAY-Z,99 Problems,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]
[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Outro]
You crazy for this one, Rick

What'd ya hear this time?
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now, the whole hood's buzzin'
When he say, she say
Don't let it get in your head
Baby, don't say something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them, you'll see
And we ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Hey-yeah)
How can they talk about our love (They don't know)
When they don't know one thing about us? (No, no)
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out

[Verse 2: Brandy]
I swear, they got some nerve
Spreadin' what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved, that's my word
See, I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough?
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove
[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love (Hey, yeah-eah)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Baby)
How can they talk about our love (Why you talkin' about me?)
When they don't know one thing about us?
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out (Kanye)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, it's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still want a man?
Tell me the truth, is that a man or Juwanna Mann?
I'm wonderin', why she ""ret ta go"" like Wanda then?
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb, before you get in a cab
I traded my cash, just to take it back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest?
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces?
'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said ""You so nuts!""
But nowadays, we actin' way too grown up
Like, ""how ya ex-girl get that new number?""
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why
[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love (People shouldn't talk about our love)
When they don't know one thing about us? (No)
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths (Whoo)
So, all we do is tune them out (Go on, oh-oh)
The more they talk about our love (Tune it out, baby)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Whoo-whoo, ay)
How can they talk about our love (Let's not talk about it, baby)
When they don't know one thing about us?
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out (I don't wanna hear it no more)"

All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend
That we're livin' on Key West time
I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright

Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go
'Cause you're getting to me

And that T-shirt from Sloppy Joes

She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things

That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me

At times, I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me

The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
When you look, you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Born and broken every single time

Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you run to me
Might see some type of pleasure in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see

[Bridge]
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

[Verse 2]
When you seek me, you destroy me
Rape my mind and smell the poppies
Born and bloodied every single time
Always keep me under finger
That's the spot where you might linger
But I see some type of pleasure in my mind

[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me

[Bridge]
When you look you see right through me
Cut the rope, fell to my knees
Born and Bloodied
Every single time

[Chorus]
Yeah, here comes the water
It comes to wash away the sins of you and I
This time, you see
Like holy water
It only burns you faster than you'll ever dry
This time, with me

466,2004,Monica,U Should've Known Better,"[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Da, da, da, da
Da da da

[Verse 1]
Oh, I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me
And ever since you've been gone
I've been holdin' us down, on my own and no

[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

[Chorus]
You should've known better than to think I would leave
You should've known better than to doubt me (Me)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side (Side)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
And it just don't matter
If you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten
You should've known better
[Verse 2]
What makes you think that I would forget about ya?
Think about it, who comes to see ya?
Every Saturday and Monday, I was on that receiver
It's me (Me) your girl (Girl), your life (Life), your world (World)
My family and friends, they just don't understand
They say I should leave you alone
But I say, that they all should just leave us alone
Don't you get it?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never ever cheated, I never ever lied
So you can stop askin', askin' me why
Why I never left you and why I kept it real
And why I'm still with you

[Chorus]
You should've known better than to think I would leave (Oh-oh)
You should've known better Than to doubt me
(Don't you doubt me)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around (Be)
You should've known that I would stay by your side
(By your side, baby)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die (Ride or die)
And it just don't matter (Don't matter to me, baby)
If you're rich or poor, out or in, doin' five to ten
You should've known better (Better)
[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Chorus]
You should've known better than to think I would leave
(You shoulda known)
You should've known better than to doubt me
(You shoulda known)
It don't matter if you're up, matter if you're down
Either way, I'm gonna be around
You should've known that I would stay by your side
(No matter what they think about you)
Should've known your girl was gonna ride or die
(There's nothing I can do without you)
And it just don't matter if you're rich or poor (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Out or in, doin' five to ten (Oh, ooh)
You should've known better"
467,2004,Tracy Lawrence,Paint Me A Birmingham,"[Verse 1]
He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me a Birmingham?
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while, she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
And I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again?
[Chorus]
Could you paint me a Birmingham?
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while, she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Chorus]
Paint me a Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while, she'll be, mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Outro]
Oh, paint me a Birmingham"
468,2004,Lenny Kravitz,Where Are We Runnin'?,"[Intro]
Fast lane
High speed
On the grind
24/7

[Verse 1]
No time
Always running here and there
Chasing the money
So much jibber jabber's
Clogging up our soul

[Chorus]
Where are we running
We need some time to clear our heads
Where are we running
Keep on working until we're dead
Where are we running
Oo wee oo wee oo
Where are we running now

[Verse 2]
In style
Profile
Got to buy
The new Cavalli
Keep the skin tight
And the booty in the air
Don't stop the party
The road is paved but narrow
I hope we all get home
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Where you running girl
I see you up there
Oh you up on that stage
You up there
I saw you

[Chorus] [x2]"
469,2004,Jadakiss Featuring Nate Dogg,Time's Up!,"[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years will cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas or over trust them
Uh, yeah, them M's is right in my face
I just got to throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I know how to get my peers off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbing your head
You know that he's sick
You know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homie, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi
I'm just waiting on a q like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, what up
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Ayo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get out of line
'Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground"
470,2004,Clay Walker,I Can't Sleep,"I been up all night long
Just waitin on the sun
I've given up, damn the dawn
It ain't never gonna come
Something's wrong
As long as your gone

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep

Remember when
You said we wouldn't last
I couldn't swallow my pride
Oh its sinkin in
Baby losing you has
Finally opened my eyes
I'm wide awake
As long as it takes

I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep
I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
If you ever needed
To see me down on my knees
Take a look at me
Baby I can't sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I could go for days
I'm not gonna sleep
Til I touch your face
Baby not a wink
I can't sleep"

Mmm, yeah, yeah, yeah, he's the one

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet in the passenger seat, yeah

I daydream of me an' a cold cotton pillow
And the feel of his skin
The window sill smiles and before I know it
I'm miles away a-sittin' next to him
Miles away a-sittin' next to him

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet
When I look to my left see his suntanned hands
His muddy river hair and his thousand acre plans
I'm all shook up like a quarter in a can
Ain't life sweet, yeah
Shiftin' those gears, baby, 1, 2, 3
Then he shifts those ocean eyes back to me
Can't imagine a moment any better than this
Then we kiss

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, life's so sweet

Ooh, ooh, ooh, life's so sweet right here in the passenger seat

475,2004,Alanis Morissette,Everything,"[Verse 1]
I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
I can withhold like it's going out of style
I can be the moodiest, baby and you've never met anyone
Who's as negative as I am sometimes

[Verse 2]
I am the wisest woman you've ever met
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen and you've never met anyone
Who's as positive as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

[Verse 3]
I blame everyone else, not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I'm terrified and mistrusting and you've never met anyone
Who's as closed down as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here
[Bridge]
What I resist persists and speaks louder than I know
What I resist you love, no matter how low or high I go

[Verse 4]
I am the funniest woman that you've ever known
I am the dullest woman that you've ever known
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known and you've never met anyone
Who's as everything as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

[Outro]
(You see everything, you see every part)
And you're still here
(You see all my light and you love my dark)
And you're still here
(You dig everything of which I'm ashamed)
(There's not anything to which you can't relate)
And you're still here"
476,2004,Beastie Boys,Ch-Check It Out,"[Intro]
Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

[Verse 1: MCA]
All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

[Verse 2: Mike D]
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

[Verse 3: Ad Rock]
Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

[Verse 4: Mike D]
I said, ""Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission""
He said, ""Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician""
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

[Verse 5: Ad Rock]
Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer
[Verse 6: MCA]
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out

[Verse 7: Ad Rock]
Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, ""Ad-Rock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale
[Verse 8: MCA]
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say ""those were the days""

[Chorus]
Now check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this motherfucking party out"

Yo.. yo... ain't no party once we crash the party
I'mma scoop shorty then vacate the party
You keep grillin I pump-pump the shotty
Put you in the trunk then dump-dump the body
Nigga you don't know, you better ask somebody
Ya'll get down, we gonna clash probably
Peel snowflake outta that Abercrombie
I'm tryna grip Britney, so I made Jive sign me, nigga
Catch me in the club with a double edge banger
I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Nah I know the promoters I'm in with the musket
Pound of that haze and a box of Dutches
High to the cottonmouth, paranoid
Make the wrong move, bitch, and your ass is out
Like M.O.P., nigga, I'll mash you out
If I can't get you here, swing by your house, muthafucka

Your ass won't make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted, huh?

Party over here, ain't shit over there
Them Mobb Deep boys got it locked right here
Wherever we at we keep the blix right there
So wherever there's beef, it's gettin fixed right there
And they can't stop us...they too scared
They know our caliber of thugs shoot at heads, nigga
QB drop you off of that bridge
Show you how we do it in Queens where murder ain't shit, nigga
This is P talkin, show you where I live
You can come right to my crib and get it for shiz
You bein manslaughtered, right in front of my kids
A little blood get on my daughter, it's nothing, she'll live
Got cops shook to death of us...we don't like D's
You never catch us runnin with the police
Ya'll niggas get your vest-es up
And ya'll better invest in some real heavy bullet-proof paneling

[Hook: Havoc]
Ya'll niggas got it twisted, huh?
That liquor up into to you, charged
That truth come out when you drunk

Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on
It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again

[Chorus]
And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

[Verse 2]
Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact

[Chorus]
And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget
[Bridge]
It only hurts when I breathe
Mmm, no, I've never looked back
As a matter of fact

[Chorus]
And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

[Outro]
Hurts when I'm breathing
Breaks when it's beating
Die when I'm dreaming
It only hurts when I breathe"

Then the rainstorm came over me
And I felt my spirit break
I had lost all of my belief, you see
And realized my mistake
But time threw a prayer to me
And all around me became still

[Hook]
I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

[Verse 2]
Through the rainstorm came sanctuary
And I felt my spirit fly
I had found all of my reality
I realize what it takes

[Hook]
'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

[Post-hook]
Oh I, don't bend (don't bend), don't break (don't break)
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name
[Verse 3]
Well I try to say there's nothing wrong
But inside I felt me lying all along
But the message here was plain to see
Believe me

[Hook]
'Cause I need love, love's divine
Please forgive me, now I see that I've been blind
Give me love, love is what I need to help me know my name

Oh I, don't bend (don't bend), don't break (don't break)
Show me how to live and promise me you won't forsake
'Cause love can help me know my name

Love can help me know my name
Love can help me know my name"

Misty sunrise in my hometown
Rows of cotton about knee high
Mrs. Baker down the dirt road
Still got clothes out on the line

Erwin Nichols there
With Judsley playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the Southland
This is where it all begins

[Chorus:]
From Carolina down to Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll Tide Roll

Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

[Verse 2:]
Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week
With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are

[Chorus:]
In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you
Louisiana
Yellow Rose of San Antone

Arkansas
Mississippi
Old man river whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

[Bridge:]
As I sit here
I'm surrounded by these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be
Than

[Chorus:]
Carolina or in Georgia
Smell the jasmine and magnolia
Sleepy sweet home Alabama Roll Tide Roll
Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on"

Now what we came here to do
It means more to me than just a night
That we'll share so make sure that you're prepared
Baby and know that love is not just something to do
It's the moment that transcends
Our physical into a more spiritual level of understanding

[Chorus]
And who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you

Now ain't no need to be afraid
Cause I'll be as gentle as it takes
To provide you with the right amount of pleasure and pain
And I'll make sure that you feel alright
Even if it takes me all night cause the joy is all mine
Now when I know you're satisfied
So let's keep giving all we got

Who knows somehow this night just might lead us

Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go

Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish

Golden days
Life was play
Pain was all a world away
We went to school
We learned the rules
We trusted all they had to say
Then life took a turn
We all had to learn
And we can't go back again

And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you
Just for you
Just for you

[Verse 2]
God was god
And dreams were dreams
Life was all cake and ice cream
Truth was true
And lies were lies
And we thought love would never die
But the world moved on
My illusions gone
And i don't know who to blame
[Chorus]
And my heart is breaking
Just for you
Just for you
And my arms are open
Just for you

And these tears i'm crying are for you

I'm looking for protection
Give me shelter from the storm
I just hope this light inside me
Keeps me strong

Oooh baby

Should I go left? Should I go right?
Should I let you stay for the night?

It's just that this is not the way I'm wired
So, could you please help me understand why
You've given in to all these reckless dark desires?

You're lying to yourself again, suicidal imbecile

To every broken heart in here
Love was once a part, but now it's disappeared
She told me that it's all part of the choices that you make
Even when you think you're right, you have to give to take

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

Picking up on the signals sent back from within
Sometimes it feels like I don't really know what's goin' on
Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here

But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day

I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah..
Don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

Get it crackin' in the club when you hear the shit
Drop it like it's hot, get to whippin' that back
Girl shake that thing, yeah work that thing
Let me see it go up and down
Rotate that thang, I wanna touch that thang
When you make it go round and round

[Verse 1]
I step up in the club I'm like ""Who you wit?""
G-Unit in the house, yeah that's my clique
Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch
I ain't tryin' to beef, I'm tryin' to get my drink on
And my diamonds, my fitted, and my mink on
I'mma kick it at the bar 'til it's time to go
Then I'mma get in shorty ear and I'mma let her know

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit
[Verse 2]
This is 50, comin' out your stereo
It's hard to tell though cause I switched the flow
Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit
[Bridge]
Baby you got me feelin' right, you heard me?
My momma gone you can spend the night, you heard me?
I ain't playin' I'm tryin' to fuck tonight, you heard me?
Clothes off, face down, ass up, c'mon, ha ha

[Chorus]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit

[Outro]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Not a lot baby girl, just a lil' bit
We can head to the crib in a lil' bit
I can show you how I live in a lil' bit
I wanna unbutton your pants just a lil' bit
Take 'em off and pull 'em down just a lil' bit
Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil' bit
Get to lickin' it, a lil' bit"

505,2005,Kelly Clarkson,Behind These Hazel Eyes,"[Verse 1]
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything, it felt so right
Unbreakable, like nothing could go wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

[Verse 2]
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel alright for once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together, but so broken up inside
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes

[Bridge]
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you, I blame myself
Seeing you, it kills me now
No, I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Anymore

[Chorus]
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
Here I am, once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes"
506,2005,The Game Featuring 50 Cent,Hate It Or Love It,"[Produced By: Cool & Dre]

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me"
507,2005,Will Smith,Switch,"[Intro]
Yo mic check, mic check, yeah here you go
Nah, he over here
Yeah, I heard he got that hot new thing
It's called ""Switch"" (switch)
Let's get it going

(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Turn it over and hit it
Turn around now switch
Turn it over and hit it

[Verse 1]
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Vibe to vibe a second, it's a club girl why you arrived naked
Hear that, how the veteran glide the record
But don't download, go out and buy the record
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey)
Something sexy bout a
Girl on the floor, all her friends around her
I mean real clean, ain't gotta touch or nothing
It ain't like I like a chick on chick or something
I'm just a sucker for a hot track
Gimme a drink and a chick to tell 'Stop that'
Dance is a hop and a clap, flip it round
Now bring it on back, break it down
Now Switch!

[Verse 2]
I gotta question, I need to ask somebody
Why is it that when y'all see me at the party
Y'all be looking like 'Ooo he's a movie star
He ain't supposed to be out on the floor with everybody'
But oh wait, whoa y'all forgetting
When I was, amateur spitting before the scripts were written
First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm
Let me see you clap, spin baby come on
Switch!

[Verse 3]
Oh you just gonna stand there huh?
What you too cute to dance? Or you scared?
It ain't really that hard to do and
I ain't trying to be in love with you and
All I wanted was a moment or two to
See if you could do that Switch-a-roo and
Shut your mouth fool, get your crew and
The thick body and the rear one too and
I'll be right here waiting on you to
See if y'all can do that Switch-a-roo
(Heeeeeeeeeeeeey, heeeeeeeeeeeeey)

That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama
That's what I'm talking bout, do that thing mama

508,2005,Kelly Clarkson,Since U Been Gone,"[Verse 1]
Here's the thing, we started out friends
It was cool, but it was all pretend
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
You dedicated, you took the time
Wasn't long till I called you mine
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And all you'd ever hear me say
Is how I pictured me with you
That's all you'd ever hear me say

[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you, now I get what I want
Since you been gone

[Verse 2]
How can I put it? You put me on
I even fell for that stupid love song
Yeah, yeah, since you been gone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How come I'd never hear you say
""I just wanna be with you"" (Be with you)
I guess you never felt that way
[Chorus]
But since you been gone
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah
Thanks to you, now I get, I get what I want
Since you been gone

You had your chance, you blew it
Out of sight, out of mind
Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
Again and again and again and again

Since you been gone (Since you been gone)
I can breathe for the first time
I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah

509,2005,The Killers,Mr. Brightside,"[Verse 1]
Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

[Chorus]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
I'm coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
[Pre-Chorus]
Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
'Cause I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

510,2005,Rob Thomas,Lonely No More,"[Verse 1]
Now it seems to me
That you know just what to say
But words are only words
Can you show me something else
Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel
More than ever baby

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

[Verse 2]
Now it's hard for me
With my heart still on the mend
Open up to me, like you do your girlfriends
And you sing to me and it's harmony
Girl, what you do to me is everything
Make me say anything, just to get you back again
Why can't we just try
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this
So when you tell me that you love me, know for sure
I don't want to be lonely anymore

[Verse 3]
What if I was good to you
What if you were good to me
What if I could hold you 'till I feel you move inside me
And what if it was paradise
And what if we were symphonies
What if I gave my all my life to find some way to stand beside you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be lonely no more
I don't wanna have to pay for this
I don't want to know the lover at my door
It's just another heartache on my list

I don't wanna be angry no more
You know I could never stand for this

Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me, I can't find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

[Chorus: Nick with Howie]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is
Incomplete!

Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby, it’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

I’m awake but my world is half asleep

But I can’t seem to let you go

One more kiss could be the best thing

And all these thoughts are never resting

In my head, there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me, but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go

I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing

This world falls on me
In this world, there's real and make believe

I can't escape these things inside I know
I know
When all the pieces fall apart
You will be the only one who knows

Yo, this one here goes out
To all my players out there, man
You know, that got that one good girl, dawg
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
But then one day she can't take it no more
And decides to leave

[Verse 1: Akon]
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Could've sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride
Backtrackin' on these few years
Tryin' to figure out what I do to make it go bad
‘Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin', and I'm so…

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right out of my life
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
What really hurt me is I broke your heart
Baby, you a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
‘Cause without you in my life, girl, I'm so…

Been all about the world
Ain't never met a girl
That could take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasin' you
‘Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy, but now so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playin', girl, and come on home
Baby girl, I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
I never wished that I would ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin' me crazy, ‘cause I'm so…

Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

Before it starts, before I begin?

Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound

Birds came flying from the underground

Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up

Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ah when you see it then you'll understand

All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
[Chorus]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 2]
I'm married to the game, same bride just a new groom
I do more then just do tunes
Cause my bills come in too soon, my son gonna be two soon
Royalty checks come like once in a blue moon
But I'm getting my dough from doing shows
I made more dough on the grind than going gold
That's why I stay fly and I'm 'flage-ing on hoes
Floss is so cool, in Austin no shoes
Just a rubberband on my wrist, no jewels
I ain't got to prove I'm rich, I'm no fool
I know the rules and I ain't got time for it
But a nigga will shine, when it's time for it
And they will hate you deal with the real cake
And they on the corner from morning to real late
I deal weight and if you bastards doubt me
I'm a hustler, ask about me

[Verse 3]
To get paid you got a save dont be spending the change
In 5th grade I was hustling my Genesis games
I was dumb, young, selling chewing gum to my classmates
On the cash chase moving at a fast pace
Never been a dummy, never did what the dummies do
So I had a mill' to burn before I turned 22
""More money, more problems"" is true
Because the more money I make, the more problems for you
Yeah, I used dude's voice, props to the boy Shawn
He made it a hot line, I made a hot song
So, stop drawing, man, you got to respect it
I'm the best, Swizz got to perfect it, don't mess with
C-A-double-S-I-D-Y
'Cause I became the best when B-I-G died

Cause I'm nice P-A-C with the P-E-N and

Marching forward, hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the table cloth

Check, check
This happened for real
Baby Bash
Yo, Frankie J, obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin' turning in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's five o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?
[Verse 2: Frankie J]
Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm goin' out of my mind
So baby, if you let me
Kick it witchu, well, then maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's five o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless at home

Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)

Hold up, let me dream
Shorty got me feelin' serene
You're my candies and my cream
Got your boy feeling supreme
Hold up, wait a minute
Baby, you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up, and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin'
My superfly beauty queen
I'm gonna keep it saucy 'cause mama know how I do
We gon' rendezvous
Mi corazon belongs to you

Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling? )

I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice that you have never heard
I want to sleep with you forever
And I want to die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us

[Verse 2]
I wanna honor your mother
And I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention like a bad outlaw
And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Making memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Coming your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
But it's alright now
And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you
With a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I'd just stare out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray (I would pray)

[Verse 2]
Trying hard to reach out
But when I tried to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I prayed (I would pray) I could break away

[Chorus 1]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I love
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane, far away (I will)
And breakaway

I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly
I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky
And I'll make a wish, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
I won't forget all the ones that I love (I gotta)
I'll take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway

Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

[Chorus 2]
I'll spread my wings and I'll learn how to fly (Learn how to fly)
Though it's not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget of the place I come from
I gotta take a risk, take a chance, make a change

Spider Loc is a joke
Nigga sound like chunk off the goonies
Ya life is a movie
You ain't a factor you a actor fifty gave you a script
Went from runnin with the bloods to a g-unit crip
What's a g-unit crip? not a gang in LA
Bang on records but nigga won't bang in LA
Why the fuck you wake me up. .. nigga I'm tired
You a busta, so I'mma light your ass on Fire
Nigga want my spot so he runnin with buck
Keep tryna play The Game, and u 'gon get fucked
I heard diss after diss, lil nigga you suck
Like yo baby mama, in the third row of my truck
Naw-vail ill whoop your ass in your own hood
You so hard why didn't u put out that song about Suge
Trapped in the closet, R. Kelly ass nigga
Get swiss cheesed up, ol' deli ass nigga
T.boz in belly ass nigga
Better ask around, I been the truth since Makaveli passed nigga
And I ain't wanna have to do this shit
I'd rather be at home listening to the Cam'ron diss
Dr. Dre said it best 'a bitch is a bitch'
You a myspace gangsta nigga suck my dick
Your flow is budweiser, mines is crystale
Put the faggot on ice he gon be there for a while
Now watch me put my chest out like 10 og's
I wore this G-unot shirt to show m.o.p
I'm gutter mutha fucka
Tell you fuck you to Fifty face, and won't st-st-stutter muthafucka
And now that I put the kids to bed
I tell you a story about a spider caught in his web
Marvel williams, a well known crip
Not cause he put in work, but cause his brother a snitch
He belong in g-unit, I'mma tell you the truth
Fifty, this nigga brother tell more than you
So I'mma break it down like an ounce of glue
I met this nigga spider at Alliyah video shoot
True, true, he had on no blue
Dmx start laughin he said 'this nigga think he better than you'
So I kicked a freestyle, and in the meanwhile
This nigga soakin up game tryna copy my style
Gave him a hundred bars, all he did was smile
And DMX named me the fuckin problem child
Now back to the future, you got a problem now
Snoopin around my hood, get fucked doggy style
I pull ya faggot ass out them g-unit sneakers
And let ya soul burn in hell on the anniversery to 'ether'
You g-unit crip, used to be a piru
Your name marvel, all you need now is a spiderman suit
Black wallstreet bitch you can't fuck wit my crew
My flow blind baby, I'mma make you do what it do
Lets take a ride Nigga I'mma make room in the coupe
Put the shovel in the truck, throw you in there too
Bitch in the passenger side, say she hear somebody screamin
Turn the music up.. baby that's comin from the speakers
She said I ain't trippin I hear somebody screamin
I had to throw her off so I start singin
I know you don't love me
You ain't the same when 50 Cent's in town
I know you don't love me
You always talkin' bout how Ma$e get down
I know you don't love me
You scream and holla when Spider Loc's around
Got me fucked up wit them g-unit crips
Tryna run game on me you punk bitch

Get yo ass in the trunk
Prodigy know that I ain't a punk
Keep these rap niggas in check like a pair of ducks
Who can flip like I do?
Spit like NaS too?
Rock a yankee fitted, still throw up piru?
Rock a dodger fitted in the middle of the bronx
I shine in any hood like paul wall fronts
Nigga my flow foolish sit back while I do this
Watch me manuever threw cedar block, and end up in hoover
I spit like a Ruger
You spit crap like a rookie dice shooter
Snake eyes to the loser
Nigga I'm grand pooba
Gave em somethin' grand nubian
Created g-unot, fifty tried to sue me and
Say he kick me out the group nigga I left
Spider, you want my spot nigga? clean up my mess
Dirty ass nigga, fifty give him a check
And if you sign, nigga put ya contract on the internet
I been bangin for 10 years, muhthafucka I been a vet
For 500 dollas he'll claim any set
Give him a 1000 dollars hell tat it on his hand... damn
That's worse than me lyin sayin olivia was a man
Ya XXL cover look like makin of the band
You mad, cause I got my own shoe
And my nigga take shots for the game like MJ do
Some say its bullshit till I pull quick
Till I empty a full clip
Get on the horn, meet me in the bullpit
Tony yayo you old ass coward
You 36 and u spit your hottest verse on my album
Now.. I ain't sayin that you dope nigga..
But you better than spider loc Nigga...
Fifty saw the opportunity and thought he could use him
I know he don't be listenin' to that wack-ass music
You got the west on your back? you a lyin bastard
You the reason niggas push mute when they play madden
What the hell made you think you could fuck wit the game
When yo claim to fame was Yukmouth's chain
Take my advice and lay low
Heard you and your uncle Yayo
Got ran the fuck outta san diego
I'll give you 5 shots when the 38 blow
Leave a hole in your chest.. the size of a bagel
We can do it when you say so
Wait till the Lakers on the road, shoot it out at the staples
Open your chest, show the world what you made of
My dick hard I can't wait till the day come
When I can put the infared on him
Let billboard rest, don't speak on my dead homie
All you new west coast niggas chill
The city is mine, Eazy left it to me in his will"

I said to myself, ""We all lost touch""
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Verse 2]
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory
[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Bridge]
You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Outro]
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)
(Chariot)
Give me your strength, oh chariot"

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face, I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Verse 2: Kelly]
See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes, but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling you
[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(We understand, don't be ashamed, I'm your friend)
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying

And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(I can tell you've been crying)
And you needing somebody to talk to (I can see it in your eyes)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (I can tell he's been lying)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
(I can see it in the way you)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
(I've been where you are, I know what you're feeling, girl)
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Bridge: Michelle & Destiny's Child]
Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell
We ain't never seen ya down like this
What you mean you don't need us to help?
We know each other too well
Girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya? (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying (Girl)
And you needing somebody to talk to
(I've been knowing you since you were 10)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (You cannot hide from your friends)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you (Girl)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

545,2005,Alicia Keys,Karma,"[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
Til three o'clock in the morn'
[Verse 2]
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me (Ayy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (Hey)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?
You're confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you
Til three o'clock in the morn
[Bridge]
Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, but believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Gotta stop tryin', to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down

[Outro]
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must comes down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me"

G's up
Yeah, yeah, come on
You know how we do

I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down

Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

[Verse 2]
My mama told me
""Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around""
Same old song, nah
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean (So mean), she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style

Staring at you taking off your makeup
Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is

So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting, gut busting

With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious, or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses

In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut

The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill

Be sure that you can turn me loose

[Intro: Alejandro Sanz]
Ay payita mia, guardate la poesia
Guardate la alegria pa' ti

[Verso 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella
Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios
[Verso 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

[Verso 3: Alejandro Sanz]
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido
[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

[Outro: Shakira]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando, perdón
Yo ya no voy a llorar hoy por ti"

Rick: T-t-t-this is just sloppy craftsmanship.

Morty: Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially beautiful out there today, huh?

Rick: Oh, yes, Morty. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it?

Morty: Yeah, you know? There's something about the air. And just the way the sunshine is.

Rick: Oh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing.

Morty: Wh… convincing?

Rick: Oh! Responsive, too! In real time! I love it!

Morty: Uhhokay.

Beth: *robotic* I’m going to work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. (Beth drives away.)

Morty: What's with Mom?

Rick: Oh, what's with Mom? So, you're saying that she's acting weird? How soph—*burp*—isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the CPU with this one.

Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick? You're acting weird, too.
Rick: Whatever, quote-unquote “Morty.”

Morty: Alright, well I'll see you after school. (Walks into the side of the garage.) Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay.

[Trans. Morty’s math class]

Mr. Goldenfold: Alright, who can tell me what 5 x 9 is? (Students whisper.) Morty?

Morty: Uh, me?

Mr. Goldenfold: What is 5 x 9?

Morty: Um, you know, it's, uh, at least 40.

(Students gasp.)

Mr. Goldenfold: Morty, that's exactly correct! 5 x 9 is at least 40! Come up here.

(Students cheer.)

Jessica: Whoo! Way to go, Morty!

Mr. Goldenfold: Everybody, this is the best student. I want you to be the teacher today. *sits down at a desk* Teach us, Morty!

Rick: *spying from outside* Interesting…
Morty: W-w-w-what do you want me to teach you?

Student: Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated dark matter?

Mr. Goldenfold: Oh, that's a good question.

Morty: Concentrated huh?

Mr. Goldenfold: Concentrated dark matter. The fuel for accelerated space travel. Now, do you know how to make it?

Morty: Uhhh…

Jessica: Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a scientist?

Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you know, he told me that I shouldn't go around spouting off about, you know, his science and stuff.

Jessica: I bet you've seen him make concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, I’ll be your girlfriend.

Morty: Uh, y-you will?

Mr. Goldenfold: Seems like a rare opportunity, Morty.

Rick: *kicks open the door* Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency.

(Rick grabs Morty by one arm. Mr. Goldenfold grabs the other.)
Mr. Goldenfold: Stop right there! If he leaves, I'm giving him an F!

Rick: He doesn't care.

Morty: Aw, man! (Rick drags him to the locker room.) Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get married! *falls down* Ugh!

Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty.

Morty: What?!

Rick: Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in the shower right now. *strips* Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty.

Morty: Ugh! I'm gonna get an F in class, Rick. *strips*

Rick: Morty, that's not class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the world. We're inside a huge simulation chamber on an alien spaceship.

Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about?

Rick: It’s all fake *burps* Morty, all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of… crazy, fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got in the shower. They won't monitor us in here.

Morty: Monitor us?! *looks around and tries to cover himself* W-who?!

Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty. The galaxy's most ambitious, least successful con artists. You know, it's lucky for us they're also really uncomfortable with nudity.

Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone’s just gonna be insane today, at least let me be insane with Jessica.

Rick: I can’t let you do that, Morty.

(Rick grabs Morty’s clothes and they begin fighting over them.)

Morty: Give it to me!

Rick: No! You give it to me!

Morty: G-g-give it!

Rick: Morty, come on! Morty!

Morty: No, Rick!

[View of simulated world expands out to reveal they’re in an enormous spacecraft.]

[Trans. Zigerion control room]

(Zigerions groan and look away from the monitors with disgust.)

Zigerion 1: Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh.

Prince Nebulon: Well, check every five quintons and tell me when they're not!

Zigerion 1: I think we should make Kevin look, sir.

Kevin: What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that?

Stu: Uh, sir, we have a situation over here.

Prince Nebulon: If there's a wiener on that monitor, I swear to god, Stu.

Stu: Something is drawing a lot of processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. (Jerry appears on a large screen.) There's another real human in the simulator.

Jerry: Okay, Jerry, big pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. *trims nostril hairs while driving* You can do this.

Prince Nebulon: How did this happen?! Where's the Abductions Department?

Zigerion 2: Hey, man, Abductions just follows the acquisition order.

Zigerion 3: Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that haven't been simulated!

Kevin: Well, Simulations doesn't simulate anybody that's been abducted, so—

Prince Nebulon: Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. *shouts* There's still another human in here! Who is he?

Stu: Rick's son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's in a simulation.

Prince Nebulon: *sighs* Well, cap his sector at 5% processing, keep his settings on auto, and we'll deal with him later. Rick Sanchez is the target.

[Trans. Jerry’s car]

Jerry: *inhales deeply* Gotta relax. It's just a pitch. Gotta relax.

(He turns on the radio.)

Radio: This is earth radio. And now, here's…human music.

(Repetitive rhythmic beeping.)

Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. *rocks head side to side in rhythm with the music*

[Pan out to see Jerry’s sector of the simulation, followed by a transition to Rick and Morty’s.]

(Rick and Morty pant as they run naked down the street. Rick shoves their clothes into a sewer.)

Morty: Rick!

Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this world is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to notice all the sloppy details. Look, that guy's putting a bun between two hot dogs.

Morty: I don't know, Rick. I mean, I’ve seen people do that before.

Rick: Well, look at that old lady. She's, she's walking a cat on a leash.

Morty: Uh, Mrs. Spencer does that all the time, Rick.

Rick: Look, I-I-I don't wanna hear about Mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! Alright, alright, there. W-what about that, Morty?

(A Poptart walks out of a toaster house and into a toaster car before driving away.)

Morty: Okay, okay, you got me on that one.

Rick: Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen that somewhere in real life before?

Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a Poptart wanna live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean?

Rick: You're missing the point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like a smaller version of your house? No.

Morty: So, why are they doing this? W-what do they want?

Rick: Well, that would be obvious to you, Morty, if you'd been paying attention.

(Siren wails. Ambulance drives up to them and the doors open.)

Paramedic: We got the president of the United States in here! We need 10cc of concentrated dark matter, stat, or he'll die!

(Rick slams the ambulance doors shut and starts walking off.)

Morty: Concentrated dark matter! They were asking about that in class.

Rick: Yeah, it's a special fuel I invented to travel through space faster than anybody else. These Zigerions are always trying to scam me out of my secrets, but they made a big mistake this time, Morty. They dragged you into this. Now they're gonna pay!

Morty: Wait, wha, w-w-what are we gonna do?

Rick: We'll scam the scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for everything they've got.

[Trans. Ext. Ad agency]

(Trees flicker with a static noise)

Jerry: National Apple Farmers of America…

[Trans. Int. Ad agency]

Jerry: Welcome to our ad agency. I'm Jerry Smith. (Audience stares blankly.) Alright. I'll just get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, *hoarsely* what are apples? *clears throat* Excuse me. *drinks some water* Ahh. *coughs, clears throat* What are apples? *pulls poster board to the front of the room* Apples are food. And when do we need food? When we're hungry. (Audience stares blankly.) With that, I give you your new slogan! (Flips paper to reveal sign saying “Hungry for Apples?” Audience continues staring.) Well, say something! Do you like it?

Mr. Marklevitz: Yes.

Jerry: You do?

All: Yes.

Jerry: So I sold it? I sold the idea?

All: Yes.

Jerry: Oh my god! Thank you!

All: *shaking each others’ hands* Thank you. You're welcome.

[Trans. Ext. Ad agency]

(“Baker Street” plays as Jerry slides down a handrail.)

Jerry: Hey! I just sold my first pitch!

Old man: Slow down!

Woman: Lookin' good.

Mailman: My man!

(Jerry dials on his cellphone. As he walks, he passes the same three people repeatedly.)

Simulation Beth: (at Simulation Smith house) *answers phone* Hello.

Jerry: Guess who just sold the apples campaign.

Simulation Beth: Who just sold the apples campaign?

Jerry: Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of ""got milk?"" after all. Guess someone was wrong.

Simulation Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Well, all is forgiven, because right now, I’ve got an erection the size of an East Coast lighthouse, and I’m coming home to share it with my beautiful wife.

Simulation Beth: Okay.

Jerry: Wait, really?

Simulation Beth: Yes.

Jerry: Yes! See you in 10 minutes! *hangs up, shouts* Hey! I'm going to make love to my wife!

Woman: Lookin' good.

Old man: Slow down!

Mailman: My man! *glitches into a tree*

[Trans. Backstage]

(Rick is decked out in chains and adjusts his clothes to look more disheveled.)

Morty: Aw, geez, Rick. I-I don't know if I like this plan,you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have a tendency to make me really nervous.

Rick: Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s out there. You're gonna be fine. (Lowers Morty’s pants slightly and puts a hat on him.) Just follow my lead. (Rick and Morty fist bump.) Yo, deejay, drop that beat.

[Trans. Stage in park]

(Hip-hop beat plays. Crowd cheers.)

Rick: Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for one of our famous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our new song, ""The Recipe for Concentrated Dark Matter,"" for a crowd this tiny.

Morty: You got that right, Rick.

(Hordes of people appear from all directions and congregate in the park.)

Rick: Now that’s more like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say ""hey-oh!"" yeah! (Crowd cheers.) All the ladies say, ""yeah!"" (Ladies cheer.) Everybody over thirty, do this with your hands! Everybody with a red shirt, jump up and down! (People start glitching.)

[Trans. Smith house]

Jerry: *kisses Beth, who is still in front of the phone* Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah, don't move. Mm, mm, mm, mm! Mm!

[Trans. Park]

Rick: Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an ""L"" who isn't Hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times ten! (Simulation freezes. Rick and Morty jump offstage.) Run, Morty! Before the system reboots!

[Trans. Ext. Smith house.]

Jerry: Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? Are you hungry for apples?!

[Trans. Beth and Jerry’s bedroom.]

(Jerry lies in bed beside Beth, who is frozen in place.)

Jerry: Oh, my god. That's the best sex I've ever had in my life. It's… it's too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud.

[Trans. Rick and Morty running through frozen simulation.]

Morty: Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to?

Rick: Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates like a treadmill, with the virtual world disappearing behind us and being rendered in front of us as we move through it, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to…the edge. Here we go. *jumps off the edge*

Morty: Holy crap!

Rick: Come on, Morty.

Morty: *jumps off edge*

[Trans. Control room]

Zigerion: Sir, they're over the edge.

Prince Nebulon: Yes, they are. Just as planned. *evil laughter, others join in* Oh, this is going to be such a mindfuck!

[Trans. Corridor in spacecraft]

Rick: Keep your eyes peeled for the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam these idiots.

Morty: So, hey, why do these aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter than them?

Rick: It's an obsession for them at this point. The Zigerions have been trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, I'm one step ahead of them. *finds central processing room* Aha! Here we go. *starts collecting chips* Grab as many processors as you can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, but they're really good at making these chips.

Morty: I’ve got so many, I can barely hold them all! *holding chips in his shirt* Look at, look at this. Oops. I dropped one.

Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you little goofball. (Both laugh and toss chips at each other playfully.) Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha!

Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it!

Rick: Nothing wrong with just a little bit of horseplay every now and then, little fella.

(They sneak towards the escape pods. Rick throws a chip and distracts the guards while they steal a pod and fly away.)

Morty: Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy.

Rick: Totes malotes, dawg.

Morty: Just kind of hard to believe, you know?

Rick: Believe it, Morty. And once again, I'm flying away with everything I can carry, and the Zigerions got nothing of mine.

[Trans. Jerry’s boss’s office]

Jerry: Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a minute to talk?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Look, I’m a fraud. I mean, let's face it. ""Hungry for apples"" is just a rip-off of ""Got milk?"" It's almost identical.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Okay. I deserve that. Um, I guess I'll just pack up my desk.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: *crying* Oh my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a patent on simple rhetorical questions! Y-You— There's not even a single word in ""Hungry for Apples"" that's shared by ""Got milk?"" It's a completely different slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted!

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Yes! I mean, it may be derivative, but it's the most successful campaign to come out of this agency in a long time.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: I-I’m not saying it should win an award for commercials, but it could certainly be nominated for an award for commercials specifically about apples, like an Appley or something.

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Is there really an award called the Appley for apple-related ad campaigns?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Could we nominate me?

Mr. Marklevitz: *snaps fingers* Yes.

Jerry: Holy crap!

(Jerry runs out. Mr. Marklevitz glitches.)

[Trans. Ext. Smith house]

(Rick and Morty get out of the escape pod and head into the garage with the chips.)

Rick: Get in, Morty. I'm gonna be able to use these processors to make some real important science stuff. (Keypad beeps.) Huh. I thought I entered the code right. (Keypad beeps.)

(Second level simulation vanishes.)

Prince Nebulon: Well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're inside a simulation…inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom!

Cynthia: Sir, the, uh, doctor's appointment to examine the discoloration on your butthole flaps was—

Prince Nebulon: Too loud, Cynthia. Too loud and too specific.

Rick: Uhh…

Prince Nebulon: We've known how to make concentrated dark matter for a long time. But now we also know the code to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez! All your most valuable secrets will now be ours!

Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get home before you and change the combination, you bunch of idiots!

Prince Nebulon: That is why you're never getting home. Get them!

(Guards try to grab Rick and Morty. Rick pulls down Morty’s pants and all the Zigerions back away in disgust.)

Rick: RUN MORTY!

(Morty pulls up his pants. They run through the spacecraft and are chased by Zigerions.)

Morty: Oh my god!

[Trans. Appley Awards]

Jerry: I got to tell you, this morning, I didn't even know this award existed. Now I'm holding one. And, um… Look, I want to say that today was the best day of my life But the truth is, it's, it's more meaningful than that.

Mailman: My man!

Jerry: Yes. Thank you, sir. I am finally complete!

(Everyone glitches into the mailman.)

Mailmen: My my my my man!

(Simulation continues glitching badly.)

Jerry: Aah! What the hell?! (Appley award glitches out of existence.) No.

(Rick and Morty run into the room.)

Rick: Jerry?!

Morty: Dad!

Rick: What are you doing here? W-why are you dressed like a waiter? Screw it. We don't have time. Come on. *starts dragging Jerry with them*

Jerry: *sobbing* No!

(Chase continues. The three make it onto a spaceship.)

Rick: Man up, Jerry! I may need you to work the lasers.

Morty: Oh, man! They're hot on our tail, Rick!

Rick: I guess they really do have concentrated dark matter.

Morty: Well, you know how to make it, too, right, Rick?

Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, Plutonic quarks, and bottled water.

Morty: Whoa! It's all here, Rick!

Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts Plutonic quarks, one part cesium.

Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. Alright.

Rick: Now empty the water bottle into the bucket and pour it all into the fuel tank so we can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time!

Morty: *freezes up*

Rick: Oh, no.

(Simulation breaks down...again.)

Jerry: What the…?

Rick: No!

Prince Nebulon: *laughing* Oh my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation of a simulation…inside another giant simulation! *laughs harder* W-we never had the recipe for concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka!

Rick: You simulated my grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons of bitches!

Zigerion 1: Kevin fought real hard to supervise that project.

Kevin: You said you weren't gonna tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, am I?

Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now?

Zigerion 1: I don't know. Can you?

Prince Nebulon: Ha! *fist bumps* Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture. *snaps a selfie of himself with Rick* Aww. Look at his face. He's trying to figure out if He's in a simulation still. Are you, Rick? Are you? *laughs, walks away* You're not. *walks back* Or are you? (Rick and Jerry leave.) *shouts after them* Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation.

Cynthia: Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that appointment, then?

Prince Nebulon: *loudly* Yeah! Of course you should! *to Cynthia* No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you can.

[Trans. Shuttle to Earth]

Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry about it. So what if the most meaningful day of your life was a simulation operating at minimum capacity?

Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took you for a ride, too. You should try having a little respect for the dummies of the universe, now that you're one of us.

Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right.

[Trans. Zigerion space craft, control room]

(The Zigerions are celebrating their victory with a party.)

Prince Nebulon: All right, everybody. Two parts Plutonic quarks… One part cesium…. A-and listen, I’m sorry for shouting earlier. I-I couldn't ask for a better staff. I love you guys, and I love all your families. *readies water bottle* And the final ingredient…

(Zigerion spacecraft explodes.)

[Trans. Shuttle to Earth]

(Jerry looks behind them, shocked.)

Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?

Rick: Why don't you ask the smartest people in the universe, Jerry? Oh, yeah. You can't. They blew up.

(“Baker Street” plays. Rick vocalizes the saxophone part.)

[Trans. Int. Ad agency]

(Jerry pitches “Hungry for Apples” in reality.)

Jerry: So… What do you think?

Mr. Marklevitz: You're fired.

Jerry: Wha--? But t-this idea was tested in a state-of-the-art simulation.

Mr. Marklevitz: Well, then, it was a terrible simulation. Get out.

(Jerry hangs his head and leaves.)

Mr. Marklevitz: Man, how does a guy like that go home and have sex with his wife?

[Trans. Morty’s bedroom]

Rick: Hey, Morty.

Morty: What?

Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right now?

Morty: Have you been drinking, Rick?

Rick: I really appreciate you, Morty.

Morty: O-okay, cool. A-alright, Rick

Rick: *suddenly aggressive, holds a knife to Morty’s throat* You little son of a bitch! Y-y- are you a simulation?! Huh?! Are you a simulation?!

Morty: No! No! No!

Rick: You little son of a bitch!

Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes, the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (Down)

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
[Verse 3]
Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met, you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waitin' for you
I'll put it down, be the woman for you

[Bridge]
I'm fallin' so deep for you, crazy over for you
I'm callin', callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true, no frontin'
It's you and no other, I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

Just ride with me, roll with me

She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""
[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was"

She five foot seven a hundred and thirty nine pounds
Thirty six twenty four thirty eight pretty fine brown
Bad lil broad I ain't seen her in a minute
Since the All-Star game and I'm still tryin to hit it
Got a baby for this nigga that I used to sell things
He caught a fed case and he ain't leave her no change
She sold all his jewels she sold all his cars
Now she dancing in the shaker club stripping for the stars
Sliding down the pole slow drop it to a split
Pussy popping on a handstand man she the shit
She still looking tight though
Still built right though
Run my game right and after the club
She might go back to the telly with me
Shake her jelly with me
Let my people bust on her face and her belly with me
I got Lil Webbie with me and he ain't hating
We some players in this bitch so baby stop hesitating

[Hook - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there
[Lil Webbie] - Verse 3
Now I can tell from your size that that pussy is fire
So I'm here and willing to give you whatever it require
For you to lay down on your back and then open your thighs
Long sharp deep and wide have you rolling your eyes
You a big fine horse I had no choice but to try it
Look like it's worth a couple g's but ain't some shit I buy
Let me whisper in your ear again I ain't gon lie
I might share a lil meal just don't tell nobody
Look you know you want it
Girl don't act like you don't want it
Girl you want it just as bad as I do
But check this out
You gon be wishing that you been gave me your money
By the time I finish rumbling with you
While rhymes get loose let's take this shit to the room
And you just keep yourself excited til we get to the room
Cuz I've been rocked up since I met you
I'm ready to give you the blues
Don't stunt now take off your shoes
Don't act confused you know what time it is

[Hook - repeat 4X]
Girl give me that pussy
Girl give me that
Girl give me girl give me that there"
557,2005,Mario,How Could You,"[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy babe
How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin')
I went and made you fly
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me)
(Love made me blind, baby) but now I see
(You had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me) I even heard it from your family

[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Verse 2]
You must be out your mind
You got a lot of nerve (to think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard)
I damn near carried you
I could've married you
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you
[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you're sick about) the way I found you out
(Go head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Bridge]
Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me
[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you??
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Outro]
How could you? (How could you, how could you just go and lay there?)
(How could you, how could you give him everything?) How could you girl?
How could you? (How could you, how could you call him names like that?) Ooh
(How could you babe, how could you babe?) How could you?..."

559,2005,Anna Nalick,Breathe (2 AM),"[Verse 1]
2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May, he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe
[Bridge]
""There's a light at each end of this tunnel"" you shout
""'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again""
If you only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Oh, breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

560,2005,George Strait,You'll Be There,"[Verse 1]
Hope is an anchor and love is a ship
Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
'Til you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars
Well, you'd better have a map
A compass and a conscience
So you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonely island
Where no one wants to be

[Verse 2]
From the beginning of creation
I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores
And sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us
To the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world
Where we have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all
We'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it
They'll be the first to sing
Oh, my, my
[Chorus]
I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

[Verse 3]
You don't bring nothin' with you here
And you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin'
Scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high
'Til I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me
Would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand
To see you both someday
Oh, my, my

[Chorus]
So I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

'Cause you'll be there

561,2005,Trace Adkins,Songs About Me,"[Verse 1]
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

[Chorus]
'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Verse 2]
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those
[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Bridge]
So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole

Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me

562,2005,Nine Inch Nails,The Hand That Feeds,"[Verse 1]
You're keeping in step
In the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Cause you do
What you're told
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you want to change it?

[Verse 2]
What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
Which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
[Bridge]
So naïve
I keep holding on to what I want to believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on

[Outro]
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?

Will you stay down on your knees?"
563,2005,Audioslave,Be Yourself,"[Verse 1]
Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 2]
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
[Pre-Chorus]
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh-yeah
To be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can do"

Raymond's in his Sunday best, he's usually up to his chest
In oil and grease
There's the Martin's walking in, with that mean little freckle-faced kid
Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday
[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out
[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah
[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah"

I, I, I, I, I wanna do right by you girl

Wanna change your name to my name baby
I'm turning in my player's card
All because of you

[Young Rome]
You know let's go
I used to be the dude up in the club poppin' bottles wrist glistening
Shorty tried to tell me chill but I wasn't listening
I can't deny it you knew me for being immature
Only way of saying sorry take you to the ?? store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom you was there to pick me up
I neglected you we didn't hug didn't kiss enough
But you never threw nothing up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace yeah
Now I see I'll never find another like you
You the type boo make a playa wanna wife you
With me and you, this money's not an issue
And I miss you when I touch you I can feel it in my bone gristle
I'm still with you and I'm sorry bout the way I did you
Know it must have igged you but the trackman you know I'm getting?

Baby, you don't pay me no mind
You act like you don't love me no more
Maybe you need space or some time
Your attitude is unpredictable
And I don't want to make you unhappy
If you're not happy
Then you're free to go on
Cause I don't want you staying around
If I make you so miserable

Won't you be a man if it's over
And just admit that things ain't the same
Instead of making me think it's all good between us
Which one's the blame
I took a lot of too much to handle
Until I can't take this game no more
This love thing is full of scandal
So you're welcome to walk

I know there's something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
You've built a love, but that love falls apart
Your little piece of heaven turns too dark

571,2005,Frankie J,How To Deal,"[Intro]
No, ooh

[Verse 1]
Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
'Cause if I don't, I'll probably regret it
But if I do, I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

[Chorus]
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live
How do I deal without you?
[Verse 2]
It's killing me to know that your heart's with me
But you're with him 'cause I chose to be in this industry
Money, shows, and hoes come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it (About it)
But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you?

[Chorus]
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career?
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live (How do I live)
How do I deal without you?

[Bridge]
How do you deal when you can't be with
The one you love, but the one you love is with somebody else
(I don't know, I don't know, oh)
What do you do when you know she don't love him
But she loves me, but she can't stand lovin' you far away?
(I guess I'm gonna have to just)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't wanna have to live with it)
You just deal with it, deal with it (No, no, no)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else lovin' you)
You just deal with it, deal with it
(I don't want nobody else lovin' me)
[Chorus]
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career?
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad

I'm sure you waited for a long, long time
To find a man like mine
But honey

I almost got drunk at school at 14
Where I almost made out with the Homecoming Queen
Who almost went on to be Miss Texas
But lost to a slut with much bigger breastes
I almost dropped out to move to L.A
Where I was almost famous for almost a day

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost loved you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

[Verse 2]
I almost held up a grocery store
Where I almost did 5 years and then 7 more
'Cause I almost got popped for a fight with a thug
'Cause he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs
That I almost got hooked on 'cause you ran away
And I wish I would've had the nerve to ask you to stay

[Chorus]
And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you
I almost wish you would've loved me too

Here I go thinking about all the things I could've done
I'm gonna need a forklift 'cause all the baggage weighs a ton
I know we had our problems
I can't remember one

[Verse 3]
I almost forgot to say something else
And if I can't fit it in I'll keep it all to myself
I almost wrote a song about you today
But I tore it all up and then I threw it away

And I almost had you
But I guess that doesn't cut it
Almost had you
And I didn't even know it
You kept me guessin'
And now I'm destined
To spend my time missin' you

And I almost had you

Almost had you

[Verse 1: The Game & (Sample)]
I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 2: The Game]
I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")

""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 3: The Game]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""

We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Verse 2]
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

Real Crips and I'mma always hold you down, that's real shit

I got the ""411"", what's crackin'
What I owe you for helpin' me go four times Platinum
I add a kid to ""My Life"", he's almost two
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is thank you
For over ten years of the ghetto gospel
You've paved the way for young black women to prosper
How you paint pictures you deserve Grammys and Oscars

When you learn stepped in this game
After ""What's The 411?"", things ain't been the same

But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere

All of this pain and glory
And 94 was ""My Life"" and my life wasn't right

And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

And I came and ""Shared My World""
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin to find my way
And I dropped a ""Mary"" album and people would say
That it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them
Then I came with ""No More Drama"", I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day
And it made me change my ways
I'm a real woman, now because of all of these days

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]

And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)

Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)

Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot!

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars
[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Alright)
Rappers swearin they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh)
But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man)
Scheme scheme, plot plot (say WHAT?)
I'm comin for that number one spot! (Woo, hey)
Keep it goin it won't stop! (What you doin' man?)
I'm comin for that number one spot!

[Verse 3]
Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!

[Hook]
Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)
I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright)

Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now

The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world
The fancy cars
The women and the caviar
You know who we are
Cause we're pimpin' all over the world

[Intro: Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, The world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine
But I'mma start it at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)
Oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real
[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, the world)

[Outro: Katt Williams]
Pimpin' pimpin' pimpin'
Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
""Put your hands down""
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks
NOT PIMPIN!
Sorry unless you part of the ""Beat It"" entorauge
If your shoes have a buckle on..."

582,2005,Jack Johnson,"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing","[Verse 1]
Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't  the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

[Chorus]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

[Verse 2]
I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Ah maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

[Chorus]
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
[Bridge]
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

[Refrain]
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

[Verse 3]
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long

But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do

[Chorus]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

Well, you filled up my head with so many lies
You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside
I'd like to give it one more try
But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

[Chorus]
I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

[Verse 2]
You can say you've got issues, you can say you're a victim
It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen
My give a damn's busted
Well your therapist says it was all a mistake
A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted

I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

It's a desperate situation, no tellin' what you'll do
If I don't forgive you, you say your life is through
C'mon, give me something I can use
My give a damn's busted
Well

I really wanna care
I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, man, sorry

To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

I wanna give you my breath, my strength, my will to you
That's the least I can do
Let me cater to you
Through the good, the bad
The ups and the downs
I'll still be here for you
Let me cater to you
Cause you're beautiful
I love the way you are
Fulfill your every desire
Your wish is my command
I wanna cater to my man
Your heart (your heart)
So pure your love shines through
The darkness we'll get through
(So much) So much of me is you (is you)
I wanna cater to my man
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Let me cater to you
Cause baby this is your day
Do anything for my man
Baby, you blow me away
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, just let me cater to you
Inspire me from the heart
Can't nothing tear us apart
You're all I want in a man
I put my life in your hands
I got your slippers, your dinner, your dessert and so much more
Anything you want, I wanna cater to you"

Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado
And I iced down a six-pack, uh-oh

Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth

[Chorus:]
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me?

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers

Sneak away for a couple of hours

592,2005,Darryl Worley,If Something Should Happen,"Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back
If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen
Mm hmm hmm"

Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

Hoy sé que tú ya no me quieres y eso es lo que más me hiere
Que tengo la camisa negra y una pena que me duele

Mal parece que solo me quedé

Yo quedé moribundo y lleno de dolor
Respiré de ese humo amargo de tu adiós
Y desde que tú te fuiste yo solo tengo

599,2005,Mike Jones Featuring Slim Thug & Paul Wall,Still Tippin',null
600,2006,Chamillionaire Featuring Krayzie Bone,Ridin',"Hi. I'm the Rap Critic. Let's talk about Chamillionaire. Now, back in the mid 2000's, there was a short time when Texas was all the rage in Hip-Hop. For a brief 2 or 3 years, you couldn't escape Houston rappers such as Mike Jones, Paul Wall, Lil Flip, and even old school cats like UGK started coming back on the scene. But among these emcees, few of them had as big a hit as Chamillionaire with Ridin', a forceful tune with a vibrating bass line, thumping drums, driving synths, and an unforgettable hook that brought him a number one hit on the billboard charts. Although, for a song that was such a club banger, it was actually an anthem against racial prejudice embedded in the American Police force, the likes of which we hadn't seen achieve such popularity since… well, N.W.A. For those who don't know, the phrase ""ridin' dirty"" refers to having something illegal in your car while driving, usually drugs. And in the context of the chorus...

They see me rollin, They hatin
Patrolling they tryin to catch me ridin dirty
Tryin to catch me ridin dirty

He's referring to racist cops who use their badge as an excuse to hassle people of color because they assume if they're rollin' in a nice ride, it MUST be because they're dealing drugs, and so these racist cops can't wait to reaffirm their biased views and pull over a black man with the intent of, ""put them in their place,"" as it were, that place being jail. And this is a very real problem. Seeing that black people are only about 13 percent of the American population, there is a disproportionate amount of Black people who are arrested for having marijuana in comparison to white people being arrested for having it, and if you've ever been to a predominantly white college, you know that that's not simply because white kids ""don't have as much""… So, in a slick way, this song is calling out that racial disparity, and by the sing-song nature of the chorus, it seems to take pleasure in subverting the cops' expectations

Grindin' to see if they can see me lean
I'm tinted so it ain't easy to be seen

Okay, so, we start off with Chamillionaire telling us of his desire to be seen, quickly followed by him telling us that because his car's tinted, you can't really see him… okay… not the strongest way to start a song like this, but whatever…

Ride with a new chick, she like hold up

AUGH!!! *calms down* Sorry, after that ""We Dem Boyz"" review, I'd just rather not hear that phrase in a rap song for a while

Next to the playstation controller
Is a full clip in my pistola, Send a jacker into a coma

Alright, here he's saying that if you try to steal his stuff, he'll… wait, wasn't this song about the police?

Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone

Wait, is he telling all of this to the girl he's in the car with? Well, I guess telling her that he can protect himself from any carjackers probably would make her feel safe, but… maybe when talking to a lady in your car, you shouldn't immediately follow up your line about owning a gun with a line about being mentally unstable…
Just tryin to bone ain't tryin to have no babies

That's… nice… so, how about those cops?

Laws on patrol and you know they hate me

Okay, so finally we get to the point: police harassing him purely based on the fact that he has a nice car

Twin steady twistin like ""hit this though""

Wait, so your friend is twisting up something that he wants you to take a hit of? Oh… oh…

Police pull up from behind and is in his throat

And when the police pulled up, he swallowed this thing that he wanted you to take a hit of?

Windows down gotta stop pollution

And then, you immediately rolled down the windows, to get rid of the smell this certain thing carried with it?

CDs change, niggas like ""who is that producing?""

Hey, don't change the subject, you are ridin' dirty! Well, I guess he never explicitly said that he WASN'T ridin' dirty, he just said they're trying to catch him ridin' dirty, but to his credit, he never said he was smoking anything while driving either: he said that his friend was about to light something up, and offered it to him, but he never took it. However, of course, if the cops smelled any weed on them at all, it'd be game over for the both of them, a fate that, statistically would be 3 times less likely to happen if they were white. Now, this is a bit of a nuanced criticism I'm going with here, because I'm not saying that if a black dude should be caught doing something illegal, he shouldn't go to jail, far from it; however, I'm saying that a young black male driving a nice car should be held under the same scrutiny by police officers as if he were, say, a late 20's, early 30's upper class white guy in a nice car. By the way, thank you, music video, for that illustration. But yeah, this guy's a young, rich rapper who got where he was by being a talented artist, and if he wants to enjoy the fruits of his success, he shouldn't be profiled because of it!

Got warrants in every city except Houston
Yeah, so what he has a warrant for his arrest in*change tone* every city in American except Houston? Jeez, man! And… what are you doing in Houston that's illegal anywhere else? Well, regardless, look, I understand about racial profiling and all that, but if you've got warrant's in almost every city in America, there's no way it's racial profiling at that point. I'm pretty sure you're just kind of a criminal. Either that, or he needs to stop letting his stoner friends ride passenger. Regardless, that was not a good way to end that verse. I mean, for the most part Cham doesn't directly come off as the stereotype that the police are making him out to be, so I tried to give the guy the benefit of a doubt, but a line like that throws all of it out the window, especially at the tail end there. I don't know, maybe a guest verse from Krayzie Bone could give us a more empathetic character, a guy who's getting hassled by cops, even though he's done nothing wrong

I been drinkin and smokin holy shit cause I really can't focus

Okay… never mind that idea…

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this

Okay, so… maybe he's drinking and smoking… at the same time… but hey, he might not be hurting anybody!

I gotta get to home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big ol Excursion swerving all up in the curb and...

Oh, on the curb? So, he's driving a Huge car down a… sidewalk…. that's… bad...

Doin a hundred while I puff on the blunt

Oh, driving at 100 miles per hour onto a sidewalk… that is… not better… Yeah, there's no justification for this! You can argue about making weed legal all day, but I think you'll have far fewer supporters for driving 100 miles per hour while drunk and high. Sorry, I'm gonna have to side with the police when it comes to actions that can directly lead to...

*plays car crash at the end of the song*

...well, that. Weird that we're supposed to be rooting for Krayzie Bone in this song as the cool badass when the tail end of the song shows you the exact reason why it's illegal to be impaired behind the wheel of a car!

DAMN! I done spilled my drink…

…precisely!
Yo I gotta hit the back streets
Wanted by the 6 pounds and
I got heat Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me

Oh, so you're committing murder now? The hell? We don't even know why he's doing it either! There's no justification for this happening, just out of nowhere, he decides, in his intoxicated stupor, that he's going to kill someone

With no regards for the law we dodge em like fuck em all

Okay, how is this song supposed to work again? Because the way the chorus and this verse is coming together, it sounds like they're saying ""Hey! Isn't it stupid how racist cops assume black people to be criminals?"" *guncock*""Let's justify these assumptions!"" Well, maybe something else is going on! Maybe, the idea is that Krayzie Bone is the one who's REALLY the criminal, but since the cops are so busy following Chamillionaire because he has a nice ride, they're letting the REAL criminal get away! Yeah, so Krayzie Bone is committing crimes, while Chamillionaire has nothing to do with--

We bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

Oh, so they ARE hanging out together. Well, there goes THAT theory

And they upset for sure cause they think they know
That they catchin me with plenty of the drank and dro

Well, if you're hanging out with Krayzie Bone, they will! Sorry, but Krayzie kinda ruined your vibe here. Whereas MAYBE you could excuse the last lyric in the first verse and take at face value the fact that Chamillionaire hadn't explicitly stated that he had done anything illegal, verifying the chorus as a justified chant against corruption in the American legal system, Krayzie Bone negates all of that, and makes it not about the common man mad at corruption in the police department, but about a reckless thug mad at police officers for doing their jobs, and sure, you can have a song about criminal lifestyles and all that, but the smugness and assuredness of that chorus led me to believe you guys were supposed to be the ones in the right in this scenario, being done wrong by the man, but when you're committing criminal acts, obviously out of love for being a criminal, since we have absolutely no reasonings behind your activities beyond ""wow, isn't shooting people and driving over the speed limit cool!?"" yeah, I'm sorry, but that doesn't garner as much empathy

So they get behind me tryin to check my tags, look at my rearview and they smilin
Thinkin they'll catch me on the wrong, they keep tryin
Steady denyin that it's racial profiling

You know, I'd be right there with ya on this if you hadn't mentioned the little part about having warrants in almost every city for your arrest! Call me cynical, but I highly doubt those warrants came from you running into EVERY racist cop in America. Okay, maybe I should let that line go, it was in the first verse, and from the way it was written, it might not have even been originally intended for this song. This is the third verse, and everything's completely different now… I guess…

Glove compartment gotta get my cash
Cause the crooked cops try to come up fast

You know, you could see this as a bad character move on his part, but honestly, hey, he just knows the game: in the case of crooked police, it's not about justice and equality on their end, so Cham might as well play along. And actually, when you think about stuff like parking tickets, speeding tickets, and getting out of jail on bail, the only lesson to really take away from all that is, ""give us enough money, and we'll leave you alone"". So, yeah, it's messed up, but Cham is circumventing wasting time with the system by giving the man what he wants

And been a baller that I am I talk to them, giving a damn bout not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even ridin dirty bet you'll be leavin with an even madder mood

Yeah, take THAT, One time! Your racial prejudice blew up right in your face, giving me a legitimate reason to not take you seriously as an officer. You're an embarrassment to the force, acting on such bigoted, baseless principles! Just… don't look over there at Krayzie Bone, just, just look at me

Well, overall, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. A LOT of this song is carried on a stellar hook and fun, bouncy production, and both emcees are quite lyrical with their delivery, by the end of the song encapsulating a lot of the distrust that black people in general have against the police. However, the constant deviations from the topic, most of which only serve to brag about getting chicks, being intoxicated and violent, ultimately fulfill the same role that racist cops look for when persecuting black people, and despite it still being drenched with tight wordplay, that fact alone throws out a lot of that goodwill. It's still a better than average song, and attempted to do more than typical mainstream rap song was doing at the time, but unfortunately, it didn't focus on delivering the topic strong enough to rate it higher

Well, I'm the Rap Critic. You don't have to like my opinion, but before you ask, of COURSE I loved the Weird Al parody. you'd have to be some kind of moron to not love Weird Al, man…"
601,2006,Daniel Powter,Bad Day,"[Verse 1]
Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
[Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh, a holiday)

[Bridge]
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Breakdown]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Had a bad day (Ah)

Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know
That I'm all yours, what you waiting for?
Promiscuous girl, you're teasin' me
You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Don't get mad, don't be mean

Don't get mad, don't be mean

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, I'm callin' ya name
But you're drivin' me crazy the way you're makin' me wait

603,2006,Fort Minor Featuring Holly Brook,Where'd You Go,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right

Refugees run the seas, 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)
[Chorus: Shakira & Wyclef Jean]
I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you, boy
Come on, let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)
Oh, you know I'm on tonight
My hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting

609,2006,The Fray,Over My Head (Cable Car),"[Verse 1]
I never knew
I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

[Verse 2]
Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on, on

[Bridge]
And suddenly, I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound, we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind"

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was  anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore

""He's nuttin' but a pimp, he's done a lot of chicks
He's always in the club,"" and they say
""He think he slick, he's got a lot of chips

I got a different girl every day of the week
You too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this, they say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin', and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin' pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, they don't mean nuthin'
Her like missin' a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin' for real
I'm a positive-talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them, so!

[Verso 1: Lil Wayne]
El joven Carter, soy mejor que los otros
No miento, me puedo tomar un verano libre
Puedo hacerselo a una mujer, puedo adelgazarla
Uno de mis coches, ahora voy sobre cosas buenas
Alinéalo, te garantizo que te voy a servir
El joven Chris dijo, ""run it"", así que corrí y se lo dije
Soy el joven Cash Money, Birdman Junior
Un presidente buscando una Monica

[Verso 2: Chris Brown]
El joven acaba de hacer 16, tengo el 64 (Chevrolet) y buenas motos
Tengo a 3 o 4 chicas, pero todo ese movimiento en ese bikini me vuelve loco
Para todo el tráfico en un ""stop"" porque hablas ese idioma que hablo
Ese tempo descarado con ese andar, quizás es la razón que todas estas no me verán

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
[Verso 3: Chris Brown]
Un descanso, dejame explicarte, que tu cuerpo me tiene preparado para hacerlo
Si tomas la oportunidad de que me ponga encima
Te puedo enseñar porqué lo hago bien, sobresalientes en la escuela
Soy un luchador, confia en mi y en mi edad, te tengo pensando de que soy demasiado joven para hacerlo
Puedo imaginarnos cambiando de carril en el Coupe, contigo en el teléfono gritando mi nombre, Chris

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame

Chica, en serio, te he estado mirando, esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
Esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice

[Verso 4: Lil Wayne]
Cariño, ¿qué tal?, intento saludarte
No estoy decepcionado, pero te cegaré si te sonrío
Estás con el joven Chris y el mejor rapero
Deja tu teléfono, trae a tus amigas, deja que lo demás pase
Un poco de Patron, Hennessy, estoy bebiendo Cavalli Vodka
Llevo tejanos y calzoncillos Cavalli, mejor que un recién nacido
Puedo trabajarte como un sofá
Puedes quedarte desnuda
Me dejo las botas y mis joyas
Nunca sé lo que quieras, voy a dejarmelo puesto
Nunca sabes quién está en casa, lo aprendí de esa canción de Biggie
A una nueva, algo como una blanca
Creo que le gusto, me tiene de tono de llamada
Y le dije, ""Ten lo tuyo y no pares""
Dame ese ritmo y lo que tienes
[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso

Go ahead as you waste your days with thinking
When you fall, everyone stands
Another day and you've had your fill of sinking
With the life held in your
Hands are shaking cold
These hands are meant to hold (Speak to me)

Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through
Move along
Move along

So a day when you've lost yourself completely
Could be a night when your life ends
Such a heart that will lead you to deceiving
All the pain held in your
Hands are shaking cold
Your hands are mine to hold
Speak to me

When all you got to keep is strong
Move along, move along like I know ya do
And even when your hope is gone
Move along, move along just to make it through

My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

You're beautiful, you're beautiful

But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"

You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (What to say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh, yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

I waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed? (Never showed)
I gave you everything and never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (Alone)
So, before you start defending
Baby, stop all your pretending
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow?
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey!

I wanna love, I wanna fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave

I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)

Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down

Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away

Need you by my side
'Cause every time we touch, I feel the static
And every time we kiss, I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat so? I can't let you go
Want you in my life
[Outro]
'Cause every time we touch, I get this feeling
And every time we kiss, I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast? I want this to last
Need you by my side"
632,2006,T.I.,Why You Wanna,"[Produced by Kevin ""Khao"" Cates]

[Intro]
Hey, T.I.P. pimpin'
Hey, shorty, why you gotta act like that?
I'm sayin', I'm just tryin' to be nice to you

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 1]
Can't help but notice how you glowing, I can see in yo' face
Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?
[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye"
633,2006,Bon Jovi,Who Says You Can't Go Home,"[Verse 1]
I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 3]
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home"
634,2006,Gnarls Barkley,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

[Chorus 3]
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

[Chorus]
Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold
Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

The more they stay the same
Don't matter how old you are
When you know what I'm talking 'bout
Yeah baby when you got

Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle Rollin on the floorboard

It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime

[Verse 1]
Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself

And not be afraid to fall

Oh, I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
And cannon ball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you can't have

I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will
For you I will
For you I will
For you

If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a moon
Yeah, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah

That's what I'd do
To get through to you, yeah

I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time
I know there's nothing stopping you now
I'm not asking you to turn back around

Come on just slow down

A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home

(And I'm better off without you)
A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is asking why...

It was cool
It was everything that love's about
But something happened
Plus I'm feeling so burnt out
(cause I can't understand you now)
Now oh

A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that

648,2006,Paul Wall,Girl,"[Hook: sped-up sample of ""Oh Girl"" by the Chi-Lites]
Ohhh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Ohhhhhhhh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Ohhhh.. {*cut off and echoes*}

[Paul Wall]
It started off, we were two peas in the pod
Motivated by love with the blessings of God
We were head over heels in this love thang
Funny ain't it thinkin back, our friends thought it was just a fling
I used to call you on the phone, late night tip
Mackin to you in your ear, conversation well equipped
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
But all the while your roommates were in denial
We felt a lot of jealousy from the very start
Your so-called friends kept tryin to tear us apart
They used to tell you all kinda lies
Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise
They transformed all your smiles into tears
To sabotage your happiness and blamed it on my busy career
I gave you e'rythang, aimin to please
But I guess it wasn't enough, cause now you ready to leave
But don't go baby
[Hook]

[Paul Wall - over Hook]
What it do baby, don't leave me hangin baby
I know you feelin this, I'm just sayin though
I know you hearin me, so don't do it baby
You know I keep it real, just let me tell you somethin

[Paul Wall]
Lil' momma been down with me for a while
When you tryin to smile I'm the one you like to dial
But lately I've been on a mission for commission
So while you at home wishin you was with me I've been missin
But listen I'm tryin to lace you up with diamonds that glisten
I got a vision so baby you need to kill all the fiction
Don't listen to what your friends sayin, they just jealous
Cause they on the sidelines watchin while you in the game playin
I'm just sayin you should be stayin, but I ain't trippin
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin
You know I got you on my mind like an edge-up
And all of your naggin me and whinin it got me fed up
I'm on the grind hustlin, stackin my cash
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin after some ass
Tryin to break that bread, I'm tryin to get that cake
But you complainin talkin 'bout you fin' to skate, baby what it do
[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
I'm tryin to tell you 'bout your friends hatin
While they be over there complainin I'm just on my grind paper chasin
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
But instead of chasin hoes I be overtime on my grind
You steady listenin to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anythang to take yo' place
Cause everytime I come around they be givin me that sex face
You ridin shotgun in the James Bond Benz
With the frog-eyed lens on them 20 inch do rims
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I'm just on my grind tryin to stack me up some ends baby
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
And all the while your jealous friends been in denial
I ain't askin much, lil' momma just keep it real
Either you're down with me or not, baby what's the deal

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table

So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

May, he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table

So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

""There's a light at each end of this tunnel"" you shout
""'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again""
If you only try turning around

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

It could have been me or you

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses

An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you

I drive off when the sun comes up:
I get back when it's gone down
There's so much I wanna do with you
But I can't be around
Whoa, time has been just like a thief
It's stolen too much from us
So once it's gone we can't make it up
So tonight, let's get back in touch

18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
""Baby, don't forget""

Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
""Hey mama, don't forget

To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her

And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me""

Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back, as pure as gold
To recite this all

But it gets hard sometime cause there ain't no one just like you (You)

All I can picture is the color of your eyes (Color of your eyes)
And the way you make me smile, I ain't felt this in a while
But I came to a conclusion that this is pure illusion
Chaos and confusion, but I'm not gon' let it ruin

[Intro: Justin's Mother]
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1: Justin Furstenfeld]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2: Justin Furstenfeld]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
[Bridge: Justin Furstenfeld]
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify, he left them all behind
And how his children cried, ""He left us all behind!""

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs

I'll share this love I find with everyone

She said, she said, she said, ""Why don't you just drop dead?""
[Chorus]
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for, kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late

[Bridge]
Always on, (Always on) you said you'd keep me honest
Always on, (Always on) but I won't call you on it
Always on, (Always on)

[Chorus]
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for, kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late..."

[Verse 1]
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

[Verse 2]
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
[Verse 3]
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

672,2006,Keith Anderson,Every Time I Hear Your Name,"[Verse 1]
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Verse 2]
Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you
[Chorus]
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me""
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Bridge]
So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Outro]
Every time I hear your name
(Every time I hear your name)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ah ah, every time I hear your name"

I twist my fate
Just to feel you
But you, turn me toward the light

Listen, give me 10 minutes
Well, give me 5 minutes...a'ight
B-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes

[Verse 1]
Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town
I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing
When it's gotta be something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
'Cause I don't know what the hell happened

And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn, what could be the reason
Baby talk to me I'm almost out of time

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do
To prove to you that I'm gon' do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay
And show you that I done changed

Only got 4 minutes to go

Who are these people I don't know in my house?
And they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin'
That you can't keep it real with me?
Is it cause of the prior relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking
And you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do
To prove to you that I'm gon' do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay

I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe
The only one for me, yeah
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time

A sleepless night, a nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you ain't got no business coming around
I'm closing up shop
Shutting us down

Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself

Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

You got, you got, you got

Me and him had 'mos forever
Like I'm 'posed to put him on when he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homie, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like, ""Nigga, you know me""
Stop fronting for them niggas outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, word, yo, it's on
[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Yeah)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl, that's right)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Uh-huh, yeah)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (Yeah, I'ma work him out)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Uh-huh)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Tell him son, yeah, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Yeah, this is how we do)
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Yo)

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Ayo, I thought we was iller than that
All them kisses and love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a nigga went to war
Vest banged up, standin' in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homie in the passenger seatin'
Honey, look, I'm a monster don
I do monster things, that's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gon' hide in the streets when the body is gone?
If it's one thing I learned that
Never trust a female on no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your mama house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you's a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Uh-huh)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Told you)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (I'm a good dude, you see?)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Yeah)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Wanna play games, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Bridge: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Shorty, what is you thinkin' 'bout? ('Bout)
Didn't I put you down?
Flyest whips
Rollin' round like, ""Yeah, that's the boss' chick""
On the side I might of had (Had), one or two (Two)
But them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, tryna get revenge
That shit, you just don't do (Uh)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, you see? Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (This for the knucklehead)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (Females out there that wanna be)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Actin' like they gettin' they little revenge off)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Takin' it further than what it really is, you know what I mean?)
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Playin' yourself)
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Know what I mean?)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl, this is don status, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that (You gon' have to hold that now)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Word up, and when I see money)

In the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (Ha Ha)

You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
That's why I'm here standin' by your side cause you always come through for me

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on
[Verse 4: Olivia]
I'm not afraid to explore my body - oooh, gimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'

683,2006,Gary Allan,Life Ain't Always Beautiful,"Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time
No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful ride"

Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore!

That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (Come on)

Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

My city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas with the bitches at me

687,2006,George Strait,The Seashores Of Old Mexico,"[Verse 1]
I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

[Outro]
Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know, ha, ha
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, ""sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Or white leather guts
Plush, bitch scream in the back seat
23's on my fuckin' so I ride and I swerve
But we're too clean for the fuckin' street so I park on the curb
[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
I got the chevy sittin' high, by matchin' corner ties
Michael Jordan's mounted up darts 23's on the ride (jizzle man)
I got man in the trunk, I'm workin' the alpine
Paint flippin', candy drippin', plus the wood inside, driving a big boy drop
A T.V. in the rear, the European clip on the rotatin' rim just got 'em up out jail
(and that mothafuckin' smokin') buss a couple you turns
(with the doors wide open) punchin' on the gas pedal, make pipe start chokin', comin' down real clean
Got 66 lebron back home, look I'm sittin' right on it, comin' up in the lane
On the corner straight gunnin'

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Loud pipes, satin music, with the judo eyes, 2nd tone background wit 2-inch ties
Cut curb on the block, it's a concert line
(dfb snd me bitch) swervin' side to side
Yup the cutlits mounted up like a H3 Hummer, but it's stuntin' 1-on-1 cause I'm the #1 stunner, goin' down 20 (yu) doin' more than a Honda
Since my paint wet, they say my trunk sound like thunder, break the law
(run the red light) drivin' illegal, in a nice ol' school, flow like dead people, I park where I can't, hit button make my door's pop, rims go round and round
Custom seats lean 'n rock

[Hook x2]
[Verse 4]
Now my rims spin nigga, every time I make a stop, and I keep that Chevy clean, like a flow on disk it mop, when I'm posted at the light
Got a button that make the top drop now hoes hoppin' on my dick like
They playin' hopscotch hhhoes hopping on my dick like they playin'
Hopscotch, when I'm on the E-way
You see me hit it then I'm gone, shinin' red paint and I touch that whistle
Silicone I stay deep (stay deep) hopin' at all cause I don't mind
Cause I'm wood grippin', flip switchin'
Flipping alpine, it's pimpin' nigga
So I'm always stunt nigga, pull up on the chevy and burnt like my blunts nigga
I keep good product in the hood it get delivered (delivered)
Sittin' back watchin' movies in the rear view mirror

692,2006,Jack Ingram,Wherever You Are,"This desert wind is burnin' my face again
God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

(Chorus)
Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me
Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are"

We are one
And no one has the right to tear my love down

Ain't gonna never ever leave you alone

The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon
And baby I got you

Life alone just wouldn't be worth livin'
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had ansered
I did something right cause

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Bridge]
Ho-oh-oh-oh
I've been here before
One day I'll wake up and it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder if I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye
[Chorus 2]
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
And you don't how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no, so this is goodbye

[Outro]
(Oh no) So this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye
(Oh no) Yeah, so this is goodbye"

I'm staring out into the night
Trying to hide the pain
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

[Chorus]
Well, I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So, I'm going home
Well, I'm going home

[Verse 2]
The miles are getting longer, it seems
The closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true
And I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try
[Chorus]
So, I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

You just might get it all
And then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah

I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you got me all wrong

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her, you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell, by the flames that burned your words?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never read your letter
'Cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all ok

[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

[Verse 2]
If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh, how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together, but alone
[Pre-Chorus]
You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do

They may believe you, but I never will
I never will, I never will, never again"

And I ain't tryin put you out thurr, as if you a freak

Pop lockin cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mami get low, give a space, let her sweat
The club turnin to hoolas cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall, lil' mama showin her thong
The broad, freakin herself, it's tellin me that it's on
You ready then we can roll I'm tellin you we can go
I'm thinkin if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You groovin and speedin up, you right in between us
If you a strip-teaser, then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin but my vision gettin clearer
You movin that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
""She doin a new, dance,"" what the next man said
I'm like, ""Naw, she just pop lockin on a headstand""

My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous—'ulous—'ulous

Wanna see you work your body

Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts—I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top
It's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV
""Just let me clear the air...""
We missed you on the charts last week—
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over—not, at least, until we say (Ugh)

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats

Bone Thugs, Akon, yeah
You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up

There was a time
I packed my dreams away
Living in a shell
Hiding from myself
There was a time
When I was so afraid
I thought I'd reached the end
Baby, that was then
I am made of more than my yesterdays

This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

I had to decide
Was I gonna play it safe?
Well, but somewhere deep inside
I tried to turn the tide
And find the strength o take that step of faith

This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt

All them things don't mean a thing

I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-thru, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang

[Post-Chorus: Diddy]
I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
Girl, please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Verse: Keyshia Cole]
If I told you once, I told you twice
You can see it in my eyes
I'm all cried out, with nothing to say
You're everything I wanted to be
If you could only see, it all belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer
(You said you couldn't get an answer, baby)
I tried to call, but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(That should never stop you)
And I'm sitting here (Sitting there) with this blank expression
(I can't read your mind, baby)
And the way I feel (The way I feel), I wanna curl up like a child
(Ooh baby)
[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take this pain away

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night (Oh, last night), I couldn't even get an answer
(Oh baby, what you wanna do to me?)
I tried to call (Alright), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why would you just hurt me, baby? Oh)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression
(Don't save me baby, don't, no)
And the way I feel, I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

[Break: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Tell me what words to say to make you come back
Don't break me like that (Ooh)
And if it matters, I'd rather stay home (Baby)
With you, I'm never alone
Don't wanna wait 'til you're gone
Whatever you do, just don't leave me
[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Oh, couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me (I need you)
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me (Belongs to me)
I love you so much (So, so), I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't get you, baby, yeah, oh)
I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby)
[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you

[Outro: Diddy]
{Phone dialing and ringing}
""Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
{Laughing}
That's really how it goes down, right?"""
725,2007,Mims,This Is Why I'm Hot,"[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)"

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

Dose of your own medicine

Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)"

Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better
Just trying to be like ""yeah, forget it, whatever""
Instead of staring out this glass - looking at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...
[Hook: T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day - can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day  can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system
[Hook: Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day... Peace"

'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Verse 2]
I've taken all I could take
And I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down
My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
I'll blow it away, blow it away
[Pre-Chorus]
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood
Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

[Chorus]
Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over

[Bridge]
We can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

[Chorus]
Let's start over
Try to do it right this time around
It's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over
[Outro]
Let's start over
It's not over, yeah
This love is killing me, but you're the only one
It's not over"
734,2007,Elliott Yamin,Wait For You,"[Verse 1]
I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

[Chorus]
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

[Chorus]
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

[Bridge]
Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do

[Chorus]
Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting"

Ay, ay, ay
Oww! (Listen!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Started in Atlanta then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, three-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock four-fifth, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said, ""I'll get it""
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

Boss, it's what I does

Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better (Move) AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy; damn it, I'm with it
Khaled, we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Yeah, they see it but no one reports it
I run this, Rick Ross, boss shit

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
Like the MAC got a EZ pass, nigga what?
Shit, I don't give a fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I walk that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga OD
Cash rule everything around me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on Ds
Feelin' like Pac, all eyes on me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees (Trees, trees)
Nigga please
I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say ""Khaled,"" some say ""Khaleed""
Twelve years down and I'm finally free

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist-wear Chopard but the Müller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big kahuna, y'dig?

I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this

The bed I’m lyin’ is getting colder
Wish I never would’ve said it’s over
And I can’t pretend
I won’t think about you when I’m older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can’t be the end

I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself, ""It's never gonna happen again""
You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down

Say you're right again, heed my lecture

742,2007,Brad Paisley,Ticks,"[Verse 1]
Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer

[Verse 2]
And in the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

[Bridge]
Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
[Verse 3]
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front

[Verse 4]
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me

[Bridge]
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
[Bridge]
Now, ooo
You never know where one might be
But, ooo
There's lots of place that are hard to reach
I gotcha

[Chorus]
I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you baby
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

[Outro]
Oh, I'd sure like to check you for ticks
Come on!"

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

And he's all that I need to fall into

746,2007,Billy Currington,Good Directions,"[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens"

I want to love you when you're sad

Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun?

Come along you'll see the world
The pulse ripples, the crowd unfurls
The current starts to flow and then you're on
Oh it's white hot soul they want
To sing for

We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the ruin
Of every living soul
We are surreal
'Cause someone gave us up

Don't break the oath
I want to love you when you're happy
Don't break this oath
I want to be there when you're sad

We are the real
As real as any ghost
So easy now
We are the real

Can't stand the blazing sun?
Can't stand the morning rain?
Oh get out I'll take your place again

Let the beat knock, trust me, we ain't gon' stop
Head 'til the lights up, watch us take over the spot
Few mad looks from them chicks you know
And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'

Ya'll didn't think that I could make it bump like this
See I told ya'll, ya'll was gonna jump like this
How you not gon' know it when it hit like this"
755,2007,Emerson Drive,Moments,"[Verse 1:]
I was coming to the end of a long, long walk
When a man crawled out of a cardboard box
Under the E Street Bridge
Followed me on to it
I went out halfway across
With that homeless shadow tagging along
So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway
He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
He said, You know, I haven't always been this way

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Verse 2:]
I stood there tryin' to find my nerve
Wondering if a single soul on Earth
Would care at all
Miss me when I'm gone
That old man just kept hanging around
Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there I felt ashamed
I said, You know, I haven't always been this way
[Chorus]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Bridge:]
I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
That old man tells his story one more time
He says

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge
When a young man almost ended it
I was right there, wasn't scared a bit
And I helped to pull him through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments
[Outro:]
I've had my moments
I've had my moments
I've had my moments"
756,2007,Dashboard Confessional,Stolen,"[Verse 1]
We watch the season pull up its own stakes
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 2]
Invitation-only grand farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
Too early to say goodnight

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 3]
And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured, and we all will sleep well
Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep well
[Chorus 2]
You have stolen, you have stolen
You have stolen my heart

[Bridge]
I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
And we all look like we feel

[Chorus 2]
You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart"
757,2007,Carrie Underwood,Wasted,"[Verse 1]
Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, ""I see the way out and I'm gonna take it""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, ""It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it""
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Bridge]
She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floatin' side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time

758,2007,Fantasia,When I See U,"[Verse 1]
I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

[Verse 2]
I scribble X's and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face
When I hear my favorite song
Should I send a email at home
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue?
I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why?
Yeah
[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not gonna run
I'm, just gonna stand here and see
Ooooo, yeah

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you"
759,2007,Papa Roach,Forever,"[Verse 1]
In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Verse 2]
Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin
In this moment, I'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine
[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Bridge]
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction
Mama, don't cry, I just wanna stay high
I like playing with danger and fear
Everybody's walking, but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here

[Hook]
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me, I don't wanna stop

[Verse 2]
Why don't they ever listen to me?
It's just a one-way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation
Too many religions, but only one God
I don't need another savior
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behavior

All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

[Pre-Chorus]
This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Verse 2]
Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

[Pre-Chorus]
When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""

With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere

You'll ever leave the ground""

He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window

But we got one more night
Lets get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs

And we'll feel so alive

When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this

Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down

Now work it out now, work it out, work it out"

Let it in
Let your clarity define you;
In the end
We will only just remember how it feels

Our lives are made
In these small hours
These little wonders
These twists and turns of fate
Time falls away
But these small hours
These small hours
Still remain

Let it slide;
Let your troubles fall behind you
Let it shine
Till you feel it all around you
And I don't mind
If it's me you need to turn to

Our lives are made
In these small hours

Will wash away somehow
But I cannot forget
The way I feel right now

Time falls away

Oh they still remain
These little wonders
Oh, these twists and turns of fate
Time falls away

You feel like a candle in a hurricane
Just like a picture with a broken frame
Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight
But you'll be alright, you'll be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand

[Verse 2]
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon with only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on

'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand

Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place, yeah

'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up

Wipe your hands, shake it off
Yeah, then you stand
Yeah, baby
Woo hoo, woo hoo

771,2007,Montgomery Gentry,Lucky Man,"[Verse 1]
I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood
I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got

[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Verse 2]
Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here
[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

772,2007,The White Stripes,Icky Thump,"[Verse 1]
Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, ""Need a bed?"" in Español
I said, ""Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone""
[Verse 2]
Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself"

I see her laying by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say

[Verse 2]
She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex

[Pre-Chorus]
And she'll go out dancing' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going
She's going downtown
I'm going downtown, too, and take a look around

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
[Verse 3]
I'm just sitting 'round waiting on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy
[Chorus 2]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man, man

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man, no"

Waking up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

When I let it sink in, it's all over me
I'm know you're here, in the dark
I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

You've got to give me everything (Give me everything)
Nothing less 'cause you know I give you all of me (Give you all of me)

'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up

And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

All I wanted was to know I'm safe

If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me how low will a bad girl go
She probably pick it up drop it down real slow
Either that or she's upside down on the pole
That's when I grab the knot throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow watch it all fly
Front to the back then side to the side
Then we head back to my crib for the night
That's how it goes down, all night long
She whisper in my ear says she loves my song
This Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone
Top ten download number one ring tone

You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 2: Sean Kingston]
It was back in '99
Watchin' movies all the time
Oh, when I went away for doin' my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other (See each other)
And then I came out
Mami moved me down south
Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me (Girl for me)
[Pre-Chorus: Sean Kingston]
See, it's very defined
You're one of a kind
But you mash up my mind
You haffi get declined
Oh Lord, my baby is drivin' me crazy

You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over

[Verse 3: Sean Kingston]
Now we're fussin'
And now we're fightin'
Please tell me why
I'm feelin' slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better (Make it better)
You're datin' other guys
You're tellin' me lies
Oh, I can't believe
What I'm seein' with my eyes
I'm losin' my mind
And I don't think it's clever (Think it's clever)
[Outro: Sean Kingston]
You're way too beautiful, girl
That's why it'll never work
You have me suicidal, suicidal, suicidal"
783,2007,Keith Urban,I Told You So,"[Verse 1]
You said you needed your space
I wasn't where you wanted to be
I didn't stand in your way
I only want you to be happy
And so how surprised am I to see you here tonight

[Chorus]
Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so

[Verse 2]
Sometimes in our lives
We get to where we wonder if
The long road that we're on
Is heading in the same direction
When it comes to you and me
We're right where I know we should be

[Chorus]
Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
[Verse ]
Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling"

Hello again, it’s you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine, killing time
Tryna' to solve life’s mysteries
How’s your life? It’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave

[Chorus 1]
If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory

[Verse 2]
I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask

[Pre-Chorus]
If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
[Chorus 2]
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory

[Chorus]
If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
(We shouldn't be) we should be
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You can sing the melody to me
And I could write a couple lines

Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate

I wrote the gospel on giving up
(You're looking pretty sinking)
But the real bombshells have already sunk

At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties

This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race

1-2-3 like a bird I sing
'Cause you've given me the most beautiful set of wings
I'm so glad you're here today
'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!

[Verse 1]
I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say ""hahaha, hahaha""
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back

'Cause you’ve given me the most beautiful set of wings

'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Fly away, fly away

There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land
I'm going to tour from coast to coast
I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need

I'm footloose and fancy free

789,2007,Bucky Covington,A Different World,"We were born to mothers who smoked and drank
Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are
We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside

Chorus
It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

School always started the same every day
The pledge of allegiance then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right

Chorus

No bottled water, we drank from a garden hose
And every Sunday, all the stores were closed

It was a different world"

I'm taking a chance, letting you inside

Like being in love, she says, for the first time
Well, maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right
Wherever I belong with you tonight
Like being in love, to feel for the first time

The world that I see inside you
Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming
Reality in your eyes

Into the unknown

I dunno... Let's go!

[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school

[Verse 1]
Mac (Mac) L'Oreal, yep, 'cause I'm worth it
Love the way I puts it on so perfect
Wipe the corners of my mouth so I work it
When I walk down the hallway, they cain't say nothin'
Oh, oh, oh, my lips so luscious
The way I spice it up with the Mac-Mac brushes
L'Oreal got them wat-ballermelon crushes
That's probably the reason all these boys got crushes
[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?

They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school

[Verse 2]
When it's time for lunch, my lips still rock
Lil' Mama melon with da hot pink top
Cherry, vanilla, flavors is a virtue
Dey, lovin lip gloss universal
The boys really like it, the girls don't speak
Rollin' they eyes, they lip gloss cheap
It ain't my fault, but I could upgrade ya
Show you how to use nice things with nice flavas

[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school
[Breakdown]
'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin' (Is poppin')
Is poppin! (Is poppin)
'Cause my lip gloss - is poppin' (Is poppin')
Is poppin! (Is poppin)

[Verse 3]
Sittin' in eighth period, thought I was in trouble
Dean called me on the loudspeaker on the double
I stepped in her office like ""Yes, Ms. McClarkson?""
She like, ""Gurl, I ran out of my lip gloss
And write down where you get yours from
'Cause I must admit, that bubblegum
Is poppin' (Is poppin')
Is poppin!""
She ain't frontin'
N-uh, I be lovin' it, I be, I be lovin it n-uh
I be usin' it, I be I be usin' it n-uh
I be rubbin it, I be I be rubbin it
On my lips, my lips (Ah) my lip gloss

[Chorus]
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?

They say my lip gloss is cool, my lip gloss be poppin'
I'm standin' at my locker, and all the boys keep stoppin'
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know 'bout me?
Whatchu know 'bout me? Whatchu, whatchu know?
They say my lip gloss is poppin', my lip gloss is cool
All the boys keep jockin', they chase me after school"

801,2008,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,"[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Bridge]
And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding (Oohhh)
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding (I keep...)
Keep, keep bleeding love

Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love"

I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

[Verse 2]
Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm risin' from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
[Pre-Chorus]
Was there all along within' my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
The time of my life

And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
Keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life

Now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Very entertaining
But it's over now (But it's over now)
Go on and take a bow
But it's over now"
804,2008,Jordin Sparks Duet With Chris Brown,No Air,"FADE IN:

1. EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY
The STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over
scene, we SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976

2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY
A live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the
edge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind
her.

CINDY
-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just
agreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of
freeing the hostages.
(adjusting her hair)
We repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some
forty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --
captive in the Statue of Liberty itself.

3. FERRYBOAT - DAY
The ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --
has been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,
who's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via
walkie-talkie.
SWAT CAPTAIN
Your demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their
way.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters
preparing for takeoff.

4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
The screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from
Laguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.
A TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,
schoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand
by the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and
a fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.

RINGLEADER
Good.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and
we blow her brains out.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
(filter; from walkie-talkie)
Blow whose brains out?

5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT
TIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the
jutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in
the whole of the statue's head.
RINGLEADER (O.S.)
(a nasty laugh)
Lady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!

6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY
MOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.

SWAT COP
Sons of bitches.

SWAT CAPTAIN
Relax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out
first.

SWAT COP II
Captain . . . what the hell is that?

All eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from
the clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head
of the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:

SWAT CAPTAIN
Shit.  Shit fire!!

SWAT COP
Sir!  What is it?
7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS
A magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,
blimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.

SWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)
Christ almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!

8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
In the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold
suited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting
inkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.

NIGHT OWL
Okay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?

He looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,
blond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:

VEIDT
(on monitor)
Let's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.

9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY
A line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a
thud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.

10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
TERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows
nothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his
walkie-talkie:

RINGLEADER
Hey.  We got a problem here --

He releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.

RINGLEADER
Come in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,
Goddammit !

11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT
The SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,
he glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic
frenzy.

SWAT COP
Ignorant bastards!  They've jammed us!

SWAT COP II
What do we do now?

SWAT CAPTAIN
We sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.

12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.
There's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he
swaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to
reveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.

Superhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather
breastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it
matches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.

13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY
A TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of
the statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is
fumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone
haywire.

TERRORIST I
Base to head.  Base to head.  Come in!
(flustered)
I can't get shit!

TERRORIST II
What the hell is going on??

There's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --
just as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.

Panic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of
a long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to
his head.

TERRORIST I
I'M NOT JOKING!!

The COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED
SHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice
and he slumps to the floor, stone dead.

The TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too
stunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --

COMEDIAN
The joke's on you.

-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As
the saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.

14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor
of the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --

15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to
the nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL
FIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.

While the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point
behind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS
and RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the
statue's upraised TORCH.

The TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the
far side of the torch.

RINGLEADER
I don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.

16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY
RORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.

RORSCHACH
Got your flashgun?

CAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and
goes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits
behind.

17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
The COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.
He spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,
then strolls over and jimmies it open.

ANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.
This one's a WOMAN.

SILK SPECTRE
About time.  It stinks down there.

COMEDIAN
B-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.

As the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched
wetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME
underneath.

SILK SPECTRE
Why do I get all the glamour jobs?

COMEDIAN
A woman's work is never done.

18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY
The TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,
CAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their
guns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a
TEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.

RINGLEADER
I don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Please.  There's something I'd like you to see first.

He holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.
All at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding
light has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the
floor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.

All except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.
He pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.

19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER
An edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed
from behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at
his throat.

COMEDIAN
Okay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?

20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
Everyone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the
TERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.

CAPT. METROPOLIS
Don't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.
(standing; to the crowd)
Now everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.

He goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the
torch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.

21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER
A METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH
secures it to the tip of the torch.

22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT
SILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.

SILK SPECTRE
Should be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .

COMEDIAN
Just barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their
balls off.

They look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead
landing.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist
hits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the
landing.

23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER
Gas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits
in a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with
UNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the
COMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:

COMEDIAN
Well.  They look distracted.
(turning to face her)
Don't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?

SILK SPECTRE
Eddie -- !

Suddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He
turns.

One of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself
over to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A
SWITCH on the housing.

A TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.

COMEDIAN
SHIT!

He hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to
blink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An
empty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.

SILK SPECTRE
What about the --

COMEDIAN
FUCK 'EM!

There's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it
around the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only
a second before following suit.

24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,
he FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as
well.

25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
YET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.
He looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.

NIGHT OWL
Adrian!

VEIDT
Yeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.

NIGHT OWL
Well, good God, we can't just --

VEIDT
Mission aborted, Daniel!

NIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.

26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT
On the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.

27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER
The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS
throwing off sparks against the cable.

28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
CAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands
pressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and
RORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off
the torch.

29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT
THE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE
touches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator
doors open, and the two of them dive through.

30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER
RORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP
streaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure
of Lady Liberty.

Three beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.

31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
A heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an
overhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.

32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER
Smoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat
against a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling
DEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.

33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER
The furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of
the statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He
turns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.

SWAT CAPTAIN
That's it.  I quit.

The water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --

34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY
-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through
the harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the
demolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes
wondering what the hell happened to his date.

Meet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.
MANHATTAN.

Down below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --
are crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge
blue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:

COMEDIAN
ASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?

CUT TO:

35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT
The Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.

SHEILA
In the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has
revoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police
have threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the
Watchmen are dropped.

On the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars
surround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.

JIM
And in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which
would ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage
is expected.
(shuffling his papers)
Well, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially
history.

TIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather

warning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade

37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT
Darkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT
UP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP
drifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo
faint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where
heavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED
PLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:

NEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER

38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by
the garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the
high-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated
bubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on
their roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.

A CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: ""NEW SKIRMISH ON
AFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.""

CUSTOMER
Crazy reds don't know who they're messing with.
(indicating the cop cars)
What happened over there?

NEWS VENDOR
Some guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.

39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT
A riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from
the DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare
with sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.

PATROLMAN
STAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!

We are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of
reality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the
city -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:
his standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his
plastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears
a path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the
back of a waiting ambulance.

DET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and
buttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the
investigation.

BURNS
Had a lot of blood in him.

HYDE
You oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.

BURNS
No idea who's behind this?

HYDE
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.

BURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.

BURNS
He would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a
call from Washington.

HYDE
Washington?

BURNS
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.

HYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after
the ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.

40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON a large placard: ""THE END IS NIGH.""  The bearer of the sign,
a hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk
spreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make
out an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.

The NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his
collar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against
the kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,
cross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in
response and plugs on.

At the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the
sidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET
CRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain
grate.

It's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its
surface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to
midnight.

The STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the
shattered window some forty stories above.

DISSOLVE TO:

41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT
CAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted
corridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading
""POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.""  At the far end is a single door,
SEALED OFF.

42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT
MOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and
overturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture
window.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are
flapping wildly.

A ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.

SHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps
inside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is
invisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the
room.

The apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,
gaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The
flashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS
and an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.

The INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains
of a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky
glass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for
his face.

He has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and
ever-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should
be. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.

We've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.

43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk
dainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.
Offhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.
He tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his
trenchcoat pocket.

44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
The beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,
and settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.
RORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive
suits.

He shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on
the wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.
THUMP.

He pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully
along the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a
CONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing
a SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.

He reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a
bizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,
rows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed
PHOTOGRAPH.

RORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,
all dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is
wearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's
costume.

They're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.
METROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH
himself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we

DISSOLVE TO:

45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT
A LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner
store.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with
the heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated
-- old before his time.

He holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough
to open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.

46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
In an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in
progress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in
knot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG
sees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious
decision to move on.  Then --

VOICE
Hold up, papa-san!

The KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and
spotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they
march toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,
almost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we

CUT TO:

47. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Slow-mo, double-frame, or sepia-tone; you call it.  But whatever the
gimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place
in a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.

It's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in
an alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of
fists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--

-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,
transporting us back to:

48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT
Real-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF
WHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the
alley.

LOUDSPEAKER
HALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --

The KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the
LIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair
some forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of
the kids.

DREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the
alleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past
help.

49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The
security system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's
apartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.

DREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs
it carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for
the kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most
peculiar sight:

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach.

50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Leaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is
the aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,
exposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of
baked beans.

DREIBERG
How did you get in here?

Ignoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,
utterly emotionless whisper:

RORSCHACH
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.

DREIBERG
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?

DREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --
emits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can
onto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup
from a squeeze bottle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
I can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're
wanted on fourteen counts of murder.

RORSCHACH
At least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.

He reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it
to DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his
fingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Look familiar?

DREIBERG
Sure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.

RORSCHACH
Human bean juice.
(beat)
The Comedian is dead.

DREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.
His jaw goes slack.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Had a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --
beautiful view.
Hope he enjoyed it on the way down.

DREIBERG
Jesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?

RORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Well, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he
must've had enemies.

RORSCHACH
So do I.  So do you.

DREIBERG
Rorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just
paranoia.

RORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG
blinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But
RORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the
front door.

RORSCHACH
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with
a grudge.
(pause)
Thought you might want to spread the word.

DREIBERG
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?

RORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He
opens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.

RORSCHACH
You the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.

He reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo
from the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.

DREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,
CAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple
tunic and mask . . .

51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
A GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is
far from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome
desk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is
ADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's
DREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and
pale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.

VEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic
patents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his
office reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the
like.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE
RINGS.

VEIDT
Veidt here.

52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT
DREIBERG
Adrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.
I had to call you before he --

VEIDT
Daniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?

DREIBERG
The Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.

VEIDT
My God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?

DREIBERG
It's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's
. . . I don't know, stalking us.

VEIDT
Us.  You mean the Watchmen.

The big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red
fur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a
chunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders
DREIBERG's words.

VEIDT (cont.)
Daniel, Rorschach is insane.

DREIBERG
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells
blood.

VEIDT
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs
-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.

DREIBERG
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at
this late date.

VEIDT
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected
you.  Haven't I?
(slight pause)
Do you need money?

DREIBERG
No.  I just wanted you to --

VEIDT
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good
night.

DREIBERG
Good night.

VEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a
cigarette.  It's ""matchless""; you ignite it guy striking the tip of
the cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a
long, slow drag.

CUT TO:

53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
Barbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the
checkpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE
rolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign
which reads ""ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.""

54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
ADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED
ESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door
with a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a
six-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .

. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple
doorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and
wait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.

The inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned
woman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK
SPECTRE.

LAURIE
Adrian.

VEIDT
Laurie!  Good to see you.

She gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall
in perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.

LAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized
machines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific
paraphernalia of every description.

VEIDT (cont.)
Nice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?

LAURIE
Don't rub it in.  I live here.

VEIDT
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?

LAURIE
He's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.

She takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT
wanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A
SMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:

VEIDT
Hi, Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)
(a deep, booming voice)
Hello, Adrian.

DR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under
any circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.
Forty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a
calibration atop his particle accelerator.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
I think I'm about to detect a gluino.

In case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just
about anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the
physical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of
time and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.

Any government would be glad to have him.

VEIDT
Supersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann
caught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .

LAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.

LAURIE
Please, you guys, no shop talk.
(to DR. MANHATTAN)
Jon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?

DR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable
six-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist
-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:

LAURIE (cont.)
Good to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?

He tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO
SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.

VEIDT
. . . Are we being monitored?

DR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the
little red ""ON"" lights wink out.

DR. MANHATTAN
The bearer of bad news.

VEIDT
We've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.

LAURIE
Blake?  Dead?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the
funeral as a matter of protocol.

LAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first
she's heard about it.

VEIDT
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to
think that someone is ""stalking"" the Watchmen.

DR. MANHATTAN
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.

VEIDT
What's your theory?

DR. MANHATTAN
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern
me.

VEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is
considerably less amused.

LAURIE
I could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?

VEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another
part of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as
we watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and
floats off to one side.

A module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of
the hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in
midair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and
reassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.

VEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes
the conversation without missing a beat:

VEIDT
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.

DR. MANHATTAN
You mean Afghanistan?
(beat)
It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more
interesting.

The module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The
cover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws
itself shut.

VEIDT
Well . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as
usual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,
Jon.

DR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds
his coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she
arrives with two stiff drinks in hand.

LAURIE
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --

VEIDT
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.

LAURIE
Please.

There's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his
shoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing
with his superaccelerator.

VEIDT
He's a little farther gone every time.

LAURIE
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to
someone human.
(beat)
He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I
mean -- he even scares the research teams.

VEIDT
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed
the world.

LAURIE
(embarrassed)
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's
doing his work --

VEIDT
What about you?

LAURIE
I suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.
(pause)
I'll ring for the guards.

She goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,
concerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest
pocket for a cigarette case:

VEIDT
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.
(handing her a cigarette)
Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give
Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.

LAURIE
Maybe I'll do that.

VEIDT
I'm sorry about Blake.

He pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS
appear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.

LAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman
lover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and
WALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.

CUT TO:

55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
A decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,
popular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow
stairway which dips well below street level.

56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT
The usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS
hover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS
stand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and
grind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.

Over by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE
off the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of
vicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the
bar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing
glasses.

RORSCHACH
Harry.

HARRY
(petrified)
R-Rorschach.

RORSCHACH
Phone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?

He reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH
picks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS
and yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.

He turns and faces the assembled multitudes:

RORSCHACH
Edward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had
help.
(wandering through the room)
Thought maybe you could fill me in.

ENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as
RORSCHACH strolls past.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
You.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?
(moving on)
Johnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?

Behind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively
toward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,
yanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Nicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?

NICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH
extends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --

-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He
closes a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and
SNAPS IT.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Edward Blake.  Who killed him?

No answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH
grabs his index finger and repeats the process.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Who killed Edward Blake?

NICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to
the floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let
fly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.

VOICE
JESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!

RORSCHACH
THE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?

By now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.
Without looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It
catches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of
glassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the
ceiling.

SILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He
looks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
So many vermin . . . so little time.

He bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it
contemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long
enough to HISS at the crowd:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Go back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be
around.


CUT TO:

57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN
The bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller
research complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and
LAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over
to where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is
empty.

LAURIE
(muttering; groggy)
Jon . . . ?

A LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE
closes her eyes and sighs.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm here, Laurie.

LAURIE
Is it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?

DR. MANHATTAN
Not yet, there's plenty of time.

A SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.
DR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.

LAURIE
Mmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?

The BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,
toward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.

DR. MANHATTAN
Would you like me to stay?

LAURIE
Mm hmm.

DR. MANHATTAN
I could stay and go.

LAURIE
. . . And just how would you manage that?

She leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its
downward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is
massaging LAURIE's thigh.

Third blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly
wide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.

DR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the
foot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.

LAURIE
AAAAAAAAAA!!

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie?  Are you --

DR. MANHATTAN II
Don't be upset.

This unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's
fragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a
dressing gown.

LAURIE
Jon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one
person again, please?

The big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical
gestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.

DR. MANHATTAN I
Laurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --

DR. MANHATTAN II
-- you would find it erotic.

LAURIE
All right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy
in this place, I --

While fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance
through a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,
she sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an
experiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through
the door . . .

58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER
. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:

LAURIE
You've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your
stupid experiments --

DR. MANHATTAN III
Yes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.

LAURIE
So you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how
could you do this?

DR. MANHATTAN III
You seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?
(pause)
I thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.

LAURIE
That's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you
can --

She doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered
the room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:

DR. MANHATTANS I & II
Laurie, please --

LAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back
slowly, steadies herself on a lab table.

LAURIE
Jon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I
could really use the time alone.

She storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &
II -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original
DR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his
equipment.

FADE THROUGH TO:

1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT
A pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard
at work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly
beautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely
wasted on her preoccupied date.

At the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:

LAURIE
The government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I
guess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.
(mock-macho)
I have to keep him in line.

She flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to
laugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has
wandered off into a far corner of the room.

LAURIE (cont.)
Excuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?

DREIBERG
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think
anyone's out to get us -- do you?

LAURIE
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no
Mother Teresa.

DREIBERG
Psychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .

LAURIE
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the
government or do time.

DREIBERG
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty
tricks -- political assassinations --

Now he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then
leans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:

LAURIE
Okay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us
made other choices.

DREIBERG
(shaking his head in disgust)

Yeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors
. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.

LAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.

DREIBERG (cont.)
What's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?

LAURIE
I'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could
see yourself right now.
(raising her glass)
Well, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .
and we're not.

DREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.

1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,
which overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters
of brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.

DREIBERG
The pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I
mean, we were heroes!

LAURIE
Damn straight.

DREIBERG
Damn straight!  We were heroes.

LAURIE
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.

DREIBERG
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the
world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .

LAURIE
(smiling)
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?
What was his name . . .

DREIBERG
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd
beat him up?

LAURIE
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?

DREIBERG
(deadpan)
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an
elevator shaft.

LAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to
her mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA
PULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a
stentorian VOICE over scene:

CHAPLAIN (V.O.)
In the midst of life we are in death . . .

CUT TO:

59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY
AN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.

CHAPLAIN
. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall
change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --

TIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of
mourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the
attendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons
of protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off
with the traditional twenty-one gun salute.

CHAPLAIN (cont.)
-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all
things unto himself.

A light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.
MANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish
miraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the
distance, and he glances off at:

60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT
SENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the
cemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has
been spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like
wildfire.

MOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the
cemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due
respect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:
gawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their
hands full managing the crowd.

A KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to
join the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the
VIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.

It's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled
marble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,
and he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,
Pieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze
plaque bears the inscription:

IN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS
WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES
TO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM

Below it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four
hundred of them.

61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT
The Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet
home.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her
through.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind
her, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.

62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT
LAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,
fumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the
card into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.

She tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls
up behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps
out.

LAURIE
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.

ADAMSON
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.

LAURIE
Why?  What's the problem?

ADAMSON
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.

LAURIE
(chuckling)
I would like to use the bathroom --

As she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.

ADAMSON
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.

LAURIE
What?!

ADAMSON
Please.

The major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The
GUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.

ADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she
sees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.

The entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging
from it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION
SUITS.

63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
LAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to
a team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard
at the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white
gown:

NURSE
Miss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.

LAURIE
What -- ?

DOCTOR
Drink this.

The DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She
stares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.

DOCTOR
Drink it.

64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT
TECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are
shifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of
a human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens
on:

65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT
We're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A
donut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,
foot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to
the anteroom.

Through a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head
wedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right
as she wonders just what the hell is going on.

66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT
A MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.

LAURIE (O.S.)
That's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.

LAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table
surrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent
SCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken
from a thick sheaf.

LAURIE (cont.)
Dr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The
quantum-whatever.

SCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the
Watchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE
hesitates.

LAURIE (cont.)
That's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.
(long pause)
Rorschach . . .

SCHMIDT
Their real names, please.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names.

SCHMIDT
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.

LAURIE
I don't know their real names!

SCHMIDT
You're not ""protecting"" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on
the answers you give.
(holding up the sheaf of photos)
These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --

LAURIE
Then why don't you ask him?!?

Furious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby
window.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced
torturers, they understand the value of patience.

LAURIE (cont.)
I want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.

One of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out
for LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door
opens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.

He passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and
tilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with
curiosity:

LAURIE (cont.)
Someone had better tell me what's going on here!

SCHMIDT
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file
are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else
in common as well.
(beat)
They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.

LAURIE
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?

All at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes
bone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she
takes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.

SCHMIDT
I'm terribly sorry.

LAURIE
What does this mean?  What does it --

SCHMIDT
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can
see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.

LAURIE
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible
joke to make me --

She scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to
his comrades, and heads for the door.

SCHMIDT
Take a day or two.  If you ""remember"" any names . . . do give us a
call.

The AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches
for the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,
she buries her face in her hands.

67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
A darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a
two-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been
watching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.

ADAMSON
Poor kid.

SCHMIDT
We'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.

ADAMSON
To hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc
Manhattan.

SCHMIDT
What do you mean?

ADAMSON
She's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows
which way he'll jump.

DISSOLVE TO:

68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY
DR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing
a navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie
with an irregular mauve pattern.

The tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie
magically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal
gold stripes.

Too staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into
a handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for
decoration.

It does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the
mirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.

69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY
TECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green
room, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.

DIRECTOR
We're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is
that big blue son of a --

He stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just
rematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's
face.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Am I late?

DIRECTOR
No problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm
Kent Turner, the director. . .

The DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a
hallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.

LIAISON
Dr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to
steer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll
just play it cool --

DIRECTOR
Doc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give
us something a little darker . . . ?

DR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.

DR. MANHATTAN
Will this do?

DIRECTOR
Perfect.

LIAISON
Now Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --

But the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by
a cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are
hurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON
hangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The ""ABC NEWS
SPECIAL REPORT"" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC
underneath.

70. INSERT - TV MONITOR
Stock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for
their lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right
and takes in an extraordinary sight.

A towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through
the jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the
greenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts
of automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation
crew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:
""VIETNAM.  1965.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Dr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific
mishap.  For more than twenty years the ""Manhattan Option"" has been
the linchpin of America's conventional strategy --

We CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad
thoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds
a corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.

His EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey
gunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM
hisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met
with a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:
""CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a
one-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding
the Communist menace in check.

DANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from
American Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake
hands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a
three-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic
accord.  Title: ""NICARAGUA.  1979.""

ANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)
In the famous words of General William Westmoreland, ""Yes, Virginia,
there is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.""

71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY
A sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop
of the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded
news vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:

BRINKLEY
For this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by
correspondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,
I'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.
(turning)
Now let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better
known to the world as Dr. Manhattan.

Applause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at
BRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.

BRINKLEY (cont.)
I suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,
where Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now
since you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .
. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that
you intervene?

DR. MANHATTAN
I will not intervene in Afghanistan.

A HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.

72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
Looking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.

73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
HANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.
BRINKLEY ignores them:

BRINKLEY
You're saying you would refuse a direct request?

DR. MANHATTAN
There will be no request.  I will not intervene.

BRINKLEY
Well, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can
actually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the
hostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?

74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
He's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on
DR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE
in the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:

LIAISON
I want a phone line to the booth.  Now.

75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN
DR. MANHATTAN
I see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.
(long pause)
I can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will
not intervene.

He sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.

BRINKLEY
Well, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll
open up the floor to questions now.  Doug?

REPORTER
Dr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read
you some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.
Weaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?

DR. MANHATTAN
All friends, yes.  Associates of mine.

ROTH
Let me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.
Are you aware that these ""friends"" and ""associates"" of yours have all
been diagnosed with terminal cancer?

The CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He
gapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face
an unreadable mask.

76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON
eyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone

LIAISON
Oh Jesus.
(barking into phone)
I want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I
have to!

77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN
ROTH
I have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly
diagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a
connection?

By now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make
himself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message
from the booth, touches his headset and announces:

BRINKLEY
I'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief
message --

Within seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,
flanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.

LIAISON
THAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!

The three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,
PANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB
THE SET.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
Dr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause
cancer??

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't wish to answer any questions.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
You see the future!  Did you know in advance --

LIAISON
The Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP
ASIDE!!

The LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but
the mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.

RANDOM NEWSMEN
How long have you known -- why is the government concealing this
information --

DR. MANHATTAN
Please get out of my way.

The LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.
SCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN
lets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said LEAVE ME ALONE!!

In the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no
microphones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.
MANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.

BRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,
there's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,
leaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.

CUT TO:

78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
The place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is
overseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post
quarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised
when DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
Where's Laurie?

ADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and
he's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely
necessary.

ADAMSON
She's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .

DR. MANHATTAN
There's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the
results positive?

ADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Don't bother.  I already know what you'll say.

He watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His
mind is already a million miles away.

ADAMSON
Jon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .
could you cure her?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know.  I only know that I won't.
(long pause)
There'd be no point.  It's finally begun.

ADAMSON
""Begun?""  What's begun?

DR. MANHATTAN
I've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.
(pause)
You see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I
cared for . . .

ADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down
his spine nonetheless.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.

And with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves
behind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at
the Major's feet.

ADAMSON
Good Lord --

CUT TO:

79. EXT. OUTER SPACE
-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few
hundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily
apparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily
beautiful
-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white
clouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing
our planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.

It's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on
nothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.
Stars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to
leave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.

80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT
Black sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so
barren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,
until we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined
quonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,
half-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than
husks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a
rotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.

A gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden
RUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue
light.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift
in the sky and descends gently to earth.

The rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once
more as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town
of Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was
once a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long
mahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.

A desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We
MOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and

DISSOLVE TO:

81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY
It's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN
-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie
and a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing
a dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:

JANEY SLATER (O.S.)
Nineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they
could at least make us a decent hamburger.

JON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten
with DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple
of years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just
close enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's
probably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush
JON has on her.

JON
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna
head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.

JANEY
With lots of ketchup?

Smiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a
bottle on his french fries.

JON
Nothing wrong with ketchup.

JANEY
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug
like you doing in a place like this?

JON
Anything for science, I guess.
(long, hesitant pause)
Janey, there's something --

JANEY
(simultaneously)
We should get back --
(realizing she's cut him off)
What?

JON
Nothing.  What were you going to say?

JANEY
We should get back to the lab.
(staring at him; chuckling)
You okay, Jon?

He stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he
pipes up:

JON
Oh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.

The lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads
for the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after
JANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.

His face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up
behind her.

JANEY
Stupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --

JON
(blurting it out)
Janey, will you marry me?

She turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the
pained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the
verdict.

JANEY
Jon -- what?

JON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes
locked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the
canteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the
door, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and
one of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled
JANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.

There's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private
trance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.

WALLY
Christ, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.

JANEY
Oh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --

JON
I can fix it.

JANEY
-- What?

JON
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better
than ever.

He holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.

WALLY
Take him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.

Chuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY
hands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her
with basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his
answer.

But before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.
He thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --

JON
Here.  I'll trade you.

-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.
With a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but
he's already gone.

She stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.

82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY
JON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center
of the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S
TOOLS.

It's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the
central screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal
into its housing and gives it a light tap.

With a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,
remember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed
with oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST
CHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of
it are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like
anti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.

He stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and
walks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK
from the direction of the test chamber.

Mounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,
seconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON
eyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to
the reinforced steel door of the chamber.

Inside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a
low platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it
hears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the
concrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.

JON
C'mon, little guy, outta here . . .

The mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in
hand.

JON (cont.)
. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.

He stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch
inside.

He looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.
Agitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the
doorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of
the concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete
block, reaches for the watch --

-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.

White-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete
block -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of
the support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.

Before his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --
TRAPPING HIM INSIDE.

He LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps
sliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams
shut.

83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT
1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One
of them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of
MILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the
facilities.

SCIENTIST
-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the
intrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few
concrete blocks all to hell.

GENERAL
(joking, but worried)
No danger of . . . fallout, is there?

SCIENTIST
No sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why
we waited outside.

The translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a
dull red.

The crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant
THUMPING.

The SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect
unison.

GENERAL
What's the matter?

SCIENTIST
Sweet Jesus -- !

We DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of
the test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the
terrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,
screaming soundlessly.

Pandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,
punching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes
to a belated and painfully obvious realization:

GENERAL
Say, there's a man in there!!

The coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One
SCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --

SCIENTIST I
Stay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!

-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:

SCIENTIST II
Building six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.
chamber!!

The GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.

GENERAL
Well -- why doesn't someone let him out??

SCIENTIST III
It's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence
starts.
(to SCIENTIST II)
What's the word?

SCIENTIST II
(covering the phone)
They're sending a crew to the generator building --

SCIENTIST IV
TWENTY SECONDS!

In a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions ""IN
CASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.""  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the
canteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the
glass, and grabs the ax.

SCIENTIST I
Wally!  What are you doing?

WALLY
The power cables!!

And now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY
SLATER.

JANEY
Am I late for the --

She stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the
lab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back
through the door.

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Get her out of here.  Get out!

But she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to
take a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils
have just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.

JANEY
What in the name of -- where's Jon?

SCIENTIST III
Janey!  Please!  Go!!

WALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a
sudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a
wall.

Sparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white
light.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look
at the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.

JANEY
Jon.

84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his
face.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,
which he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .
. .

. . . and everything in the room goes blue.

85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT
The SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to
tear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind
them.

JANEY
Jon . . .
(shrieking)
JON!!!

86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of
unbelievable agony.

A moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a
photographic negative -- stands in his place.

Then the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The
iridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to
pieces.

And then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,
and we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of
the SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,
who gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.

DISSOLVE TO:

87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT
The desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall
behind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago
at 11:48 PM.

For a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches
the rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the
door of the canteen.

88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.

89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
TWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into
the mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous
thing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal
cord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous
system.

They pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in
a haze of shimmering blue light.

90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
HORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A
partially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS
for several seconds before vanishing altogether.

92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.

93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT
Dinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.

JANEY
I can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it
feels haunted.

WALLY
It'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.
(tugging at his ear)
Do you hear some kind of -- whistling?

Indeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.
Odder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.
Everyone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish
phenomenon.

UTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without
warning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW
suffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .

. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,
nude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and
utensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.

JANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go
to her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.

JANEY
JON-N-N-N!!!

DISSOLVE TO:

94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
THE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,
stares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and
begins to dig.

A couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,
tattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and
Janey Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new
engagement ring.

His fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.

95. SERIES OF SHOTS
Quick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:

-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;

-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue
light;

-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.
There's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a
terrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .

-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom
cloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.

96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN
Fists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in
the ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at
first, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue
starburst a mile above the ground.

97. EXT. OUTER SPACE
All at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth
at unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on
toward Mars.

The red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame
as we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.
Individual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:
vast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.
Herschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre
planitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling
two jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular
ridge.

Two eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a
happy-face.

Many miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian
atmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we

98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN
The late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.
As the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on
his angered face:

DR. MANHATTAN
I said leave me alone!!

Then there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same
positions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on
the White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.

PULL BACK TO:

99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT
A restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.
She's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the
big metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy
furnished studio.

TV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)
-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported
a crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania
Avenue!

TV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)
Well, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --

LAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,
SCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.

SCHMIDT
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.

LAURIE
Am I free to go?

SCHMIDT
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move
it.

LAURIE
(fed up; exploding)
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit
--

SCHMIDT
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan
border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living
soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic
weapons has finally flipped out.

LAURIE
Jon??  You mean he's --

SCHMIDT
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard
has apparently left the planet.

CUT TO:

100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY
The same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:

DR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH
Russian Tanks Advance
President Vows ""Maximum Force""
WHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?

And on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS
VENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:

NEWS VENDOR
I'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,
bombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a
bitch --

CUSTOMER
Anyone ever tell you you're full of shit?

NEWS VENDOR
Kiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!

VOICE
New Frontiersman, please.

The NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old
friend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.
He rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under
the counter.

NEWS VENDOR
Here you go, pal.  Two bucks.
(beat)
Well, I see the world ain't ended yet.

The STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  ""EXPOSED: RED
PLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!""

STREET CRAZY

101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
A row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A
DRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight
WOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and
off as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging
tipsy giggles.

102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT
A three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN
ushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;
his is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --
we'll call him MOLOCH.

MOLOCH
Now.  What was milady drinking?

LUCY
Gin.  Straight up --
(mock-ladylike)

-- with a little twist of lime.

She laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest
joke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:

MOLOCH
I think I can oblige.

103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
MOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The
contents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen
floor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a
disaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in
the doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.

LUCY
Jeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?

On cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.
He grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen
table.

RORSCHACH
Moloch.  Did you miss me?

LUCY
Willie!  Jesus!  What's going on?

RORSCHACH
(glancing up)
Who's the welfare mother?

MOLOCH
I don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong
guy.

RORSCHACH
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.

MOLOCH
You're making a big --

RORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against
the table -- repeatedly, to the beat.

RORSCHACH
Terrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.

MOLOCH
ALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?

LUCY
Willie, what's he talking about?

RORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.
RORSCHACH kneels beside him.

MOLOCH
Look, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for
ten years.  I --

RORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him
close.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:

RORSCHACH
Turned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.
(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)
Hnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.

He shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar
bowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as
MOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Comedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's
behind it?

MOLOCH
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with
--

RORSCHACH
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.

MOLOCH
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --

RORSCHACH
Don't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.

LUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as
RORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when
he stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Word of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.

-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously
at MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking
about.

104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY
The familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a
big round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world
looming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a
MILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight
POINTER,
highlighting areas of strategic importance.

ANALYST
Our projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there
it's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.

GENERAL
Respectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're
quizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.

MOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which
bears the seal of the President of the United States.

PRESIDENT
First strike.
(long pause)
I'd like to view the simulation.

The ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.

ANALYST
Optimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of
their retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.

On the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the
Pacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --
blossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION
SYMBOLS as they strike their targets.

PRESIDENT
What about our end?

ANALYST
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that
twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.

On the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.

ANALYST (cont.)
Britain down -- Germany down --

PRESIDENT
What kind of time frame are we talking about?

ANALYST
Thirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified
command bunker at the time of the launch order.

RADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,
Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.

PRESIDENT
. . . Of course.

By now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a
dedicated optimist, turns to announce:

ANALYST
As you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the
farm belt.

PRESIDENT
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . ""nuclear winter""
theory?

ANALYST
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .
may depend on a quirk of the weather.

PRESIDENT
The weather.  I see.
(pause)
Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum
strike conditions.

The SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:

SECRETARY LIDDY
Dick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan
may decide to return.

With a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the
table -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined
and tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than
that beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at
74.

PRESIDENT (cont.)
Good God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of
retirement.

A private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an
examination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the
doorway.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.

LAURIE
Not at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.

106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK
A greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near
the entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken
tandoori.

DREIBERG
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a
couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .
(pause)
How about you, Laurie?

LAURIE
(lying -- with forced cheer)
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the
hell out.
(shrugging)
No expense account.  No place to live.

DREIBERG
You'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each
other, someone might put two and two together . . .

LAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.

LAURIE
They're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're
right on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the
Watchmen.

DREIBERG
Maybe not, but why take chances?

LAURIE
Dan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent
all these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --
I feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own
life, and --

-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a
damper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts
to get up.

LAURIE
I'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find
myself a cheap room.

DREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the
door of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and
chases her down:

DREIBERG
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .
.
LAURIE
Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --

DREIBERG
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely
right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.

LAURIE
You're sure?

He nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the
restaurant.

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the
street outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of
frame, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of
ketchup.

He inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down
question mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he
opens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.

107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET
A SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,
then disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls
casually down the alleyway.

He moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the
crumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a
small recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a
shifting INKBLOT MASK.

108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:
flowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.
It's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative ""aah"" as
DREIBERG ushers her in.

LAURIE
This is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.

DREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands
there for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.

LAURIE (cont.)
Are you . . . waiting for a tip?

DREIBERG
Oh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I
mean, if you need some aspirin, or --

LAURIE
I'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really
sweet.  Sleep tight, okay?

She gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her
unpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.

109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG
As he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE
unbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door
shut.

110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
DREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds
his hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.

111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE
Another quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --
LAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off
valiantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.

An oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into
frame; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP
overhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and
snatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.

His head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom
adjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of
LAURIE.

Early morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in
an alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and
crewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.

MOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA
DINER.

114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
A twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and
pulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the
nose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges
of his EYELIDS.

His eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;
bizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it
up . . .

There's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.

A low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and
sees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.

He GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and
holds the stall door shut.

RORSCHACH
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational
drugs.

MOLOCH
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got
something for you.

A long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.

MOLOCH (cont.)
There's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on
a case, trying to track 'em down.
(beat)
It's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all
I've been able to find out.

RORSCHACH
Drug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.
(snarling)
Let it go time.  In future -- just say no.

With that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits
there a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.  It won't
open.

MOLOCH
HEY!!

RORSCHACH's stuck a broomstick through the door handles on the
adjacent stalls. As MOLOCH POUNDS on the door in frustration, we

A plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's
decorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in
an overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the
process of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure
who's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.

JUSTINE
Now Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.
Are you the world's smartest man?

VEIDT
Oh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.

A round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!

JUSTINE
You're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty
basic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday
lives.
(pause)
If you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?

VEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls
out his gold cigarette case.

VEIDT
Sphinx brand.
(opening the case)
When I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .
humanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good
in the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,
that no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs
as you smoke it?
(lighting up)
In fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?

JUSTINE
Thanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your
old colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --

VEIDT
(bristling)
No.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the
Watchmen.

JUSTINE
Oh sweetheart, just a quick one.

VEIDT
No.  We laid out very careful ground rules --

VEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.
He glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.

VEIDT (cont.)
-- we agreed specifically --

MORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting
curious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.

VEIDT (cont.)
Excuse me a second.

He goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley
JUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.

116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY
VEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with
his mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:

VEIDT
KITTY!!

One last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --
no visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his
dignity.

VEIDT (cont.)
How the hell did you get in here?

The curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He
looks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass
window.

RORSCHACH
New information.

VEIDT
(pointing to the telephone)
Ever see one of these before?

RORSCHACH
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked
up.

VEIDT
What is that ungodly smell?

RORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark
HISS.

RORSCHACH
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .

VEIDT
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a
roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.
(beat)
And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us
all look bad.

Fate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad
press.

He makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.

DREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a
broiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and
cursing.

LAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full
glass of wine and thrusts it at him.

LAURIE
Daniel -- drink this.  Immediately.
(smiling)
I swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.

Sucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think
of you as Dr. Manhattan's --

He catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.

LAURIE
His what?

DREIBERG
His . . . whatever.

LAURIE
I'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?

She spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward
the dining room.

more difficult than we have to, huh?

A DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty
dishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in
dismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball
game.

LAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much
interest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo
cabinet.

LAURIE
That's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.
(smiling)
God!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.

She's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it
are row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's
items.

DREIBERG
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I
listen to -- it never came out on crystal.

LAURIE
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.
(flipping through records)
Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these
people.

DREIBERG
Play one.  Educate yourself.

LAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar
COMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and
gazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.

LAURIE
Oh look.  It's Adrian's ad.

TV CHORUS
""Oh my darling, it's incredible,
That someone so unforgettable . . .""

MOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as
RORSCHACH lets himself in.

TV CHORUS

RORSCHACH
Moloch?

No reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,
seemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance
around the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,
the WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her
face:

TV ANNOUNCER
The years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and
wrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming
NOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses
the aging process . . .

Moloch?

He creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.

121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH
staring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND
BULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and
spins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --

For the smooth young face he'll never forget --

122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the
TV ad.

TV ANNOUNCER

DREIBERG
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?

LAURIE
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm
thirty-eight years old!

DREIBERG
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide
it?

LAURIE
I like the way you look.
(beat)
It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.
But you, Daniel, you look . . .

DREIBERG
Old?

LAURIE
Not at all.  You look very -- dashing.
(standing up)
Here, you pick one.

DREIBERG
. . . What?

LAURIE
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.

Her tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,
with a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.

123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
RORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:

LOUDSPEAKER
RORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO
COME OUT.

He goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street
outside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A
CTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.

LOUDSPEAKER
YOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!

He's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES
-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.

124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
The PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller
tune, ""S'posin'.""  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces
illuminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile
she reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt
pocket.

Dreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making
him nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her
hands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so
that he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on
his mouth.

The PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:

""S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .
Do you think that you could love me too . . .""

125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
SONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a
horrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying
a plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --
ordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around
under the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,
rubbing alcohol, Drano.

Almost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the
burners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .
Would it impress you . . .""

126. INT. TENEMENT - FRONT STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
A contingent of ARMED CTU MEN rushing silently up the stairs.

""Or would it distress you?  Hmm?""

127. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and
rubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --
resting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the
front door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the
hallway just outside the living room.

The door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH
strikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --
creating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the
puddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF
BOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .""

128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in
disarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,
unable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going
well.

""S'posin' I declare it
Would you take my love and share it?
I'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .""

He wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her
breast.

129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
INSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through
the kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.

He empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he
ducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.

130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
RORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper
into its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from
the smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov
cocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.

The COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit
the floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.

RORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is
coming up with back way behind him.

131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)
Charred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.

132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)
A GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE
hails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:

""S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .
Would it impress you? . . .""

133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it
anymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and
sits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she
doesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,
embracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.

"". . . Or would it distress you?""

134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)
RORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.
By now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU
COPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.

He still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for
his last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,
where it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.

""S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .
Would you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .""

The COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He
steps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their
weapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.

The COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as
RORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.

135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
RORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the
face.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a
blimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN
FIRE peppers the roof.

""S'posin' I declare it.
Would you take my love and share it? . . .""

RORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE
ESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front
of the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on
the street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and
tries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed
AIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.

""I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.""

The song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL
OF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street
below.

136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT
Three stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and
lies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on
him instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle
butts.

COPS
GET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!

RORSCHACH
GNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!

In seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face
topped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar
face . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand
with his placards announcing the end of the world.

COP
Christ.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears
elevator shoes!

RORSCHACH
NO!!  NO!!  GIVE IT BACK!!

He kicks and claws at the COPS as they drag him unceremoniously off
to a nearby van.

COP II
So that's the terror of the underworld.  That ugly little zero.

RORSCHACH
GIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!

The van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS
arrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.

CUT TO:

137. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE stretched out on the sofa, under a blanket.  He
stares up at the ceiling, still troubled.

DREIBERG
I'm sorry, Laurie.  I --

LAURIE
It's all right, Dan.  I just want you to hold me, okay?  -- Just hold
me.

For a few moments she lies nestled peacefully against his chest.  His
gaze drifts over to the TV.  Suddenly he BLANCHES.

LAURIE
Daniel.  What --

On the TV screen is a huge bluescreen closeup of RORSCHACH.  DANIEL
reaches for the remote control to turn up the volume.

TV ANCHOR
. . . A ten-year manhunt ended tonight with the capture of the masked
vigilante known as Rorschach.  Eight CTU men died in the violent
confrontation at a downtown tenement . . .

The news report CUTS LIVE to the smoking wreckage of the tenement.

LAURIE
Eight cops?  Oh, great.  A jury's gonna love that.

DREIBERG
Are you kidding?  If they put him in jail he's dead.  He'll never get
to trial.

Now the screen shows side-by-side closeups of the inkblot mask and
the acne-scarred face beneath it.  LAURIE looks on, transfixed.

TV ANCHOR
. . . identified as Walter Joseph Kovacs, 44, a transient with a
history of psychological disorders.  A former landlord described
Kovacs as a self-confessed loner and political extremist:

LANDLORD (ON TV)
All kinda weirdo literature, paraphernalia . . . you shoulda seen that
place when I threw him out.  Talk about pigpens --

LAURIE hits the mute button, settles back and lets out a low
whistle.  DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to
pace the room.

LAURIE
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.
(beat)
I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?
What's wrong?

DREIBERG
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.

He stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?

138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING
The familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID
-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement
nearby, reading a comic book.

The NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic
little number entitled ""COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.""

NEWS VENDOR
Hey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for
that.

KID
No way.  This one sucks.

A CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the
newsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.

DR. LONG
Gazette, please.

The NEWS VENDOR hands over a copy of the Gazette.  The cover
bears side-by-side photos of RORSCHACH and his alter ego, KOVACS,
with the banner headline: ""CTU APPREHENDS MASKED KILLER.""

NEWS VENDOR
'Dyou see this?  This guy's a customer of mine!
(shaking his head)
I mean, I always knew he was a little flaky, but -- wild, huh?  You
never know.

LONG hands over a quarter, unfolds the paper and begins to read as he
wanders off down the street.

139. STUDY - NIGHT
DR. LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk
with a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of
RORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the
NYPD:

NAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph
ADDRESS: Transient
BORN: 3/21/43
MOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J. (nee Glick)
FATHER'S NAME: Unknown

By now LONG is working on his third pot of coffee.  His wife, SYLVIA,
wanders in behind him, dressed for bed in her robe and slippers.  When
she rests her hands on his shoulders, he nearly jumps out of his
seat.

DR. LONG
Oh!  Sorry.  I didn't hear you.

SYLVIA
How much longer?
(staring down at the desk)
It's that vigilante, isn't it.  That --

DR. LONG
Rorschach
(correcting himself)
Kovacs.  Incredible case.  Blinded two children at the age of ten.
We pulled his record from the juvenile home --

Without looking up he shoves a sheaf of papers in SYLVIA's
direction.

DR. LONG (cont.)
No father.  Mother a prostitute.  Some evidence of systematic child
abuse . . .
(swiveling to face her)
Classic case of misplaced aggression.  You know, these vigilantes,
these ""Watchmen"" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out
just what makes them do it.

SYLVIA
Malcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.

SYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS
FIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.
They're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and
crotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title ""MY
DREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.""

It's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a
shiver.

SYLVIA (cont.)
Why don't you come to bed?

DR. LONG
(totally engrossed)
I'd like to get my hands on some of the others.  Explosive
material.
(grabbing a transcript)

Mother died when he was fourteen.  When they told him, he had one
word of comment: ""Good.""

SYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,
and gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG
goes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.

DR. LONG (cont.)
Still, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an
extraordinary mind.  I think I can reach him.
(nodding his head)
I can reach him.

CUT TO:

140. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
A bare, windowless chamber, 10' by 10'.  LONG and RORSCHACH sit in
folding chairs on opposite sides of a square table.  The doctor
reaches into his briefcase and pulls out a stack of CARDS.

DR. LONG
Now, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look
at each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All
right?

RORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.  DR. LONG turns up
the first card, a symmetrical inkblot, part of a Rorschach test.

RORSCHACH
Butterfly.

LONG nods, makes a notation on a pad, turns up the next card.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Some nice flowers.

LONG eyes him skeptically, makes another note, turns up the third
card.  RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
A doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.

He shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of
frustration.

DR. LONG
Walter --

RORSCHACH
Don't call me that.

DR. LONG
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to
hear.

RORSCHACH
Wrong answers?

DR. LONG
There's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest
response, I can't help you.
(pause)
I want to help you.  I want to know all about you.

RORSCHACH
Hnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.

LONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.
He shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under
the table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.

DR. LONG
Well, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide
to cooperate.

TWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to
leave.  He pauses in the doorway.

RORSCHACH
Doctor.  You don't want to help me.  You just want to find out what
makes me sick.
(beat)
You'll find out.  -- You'll find out.

CUT TO:

141. INT. VEIDT INDUSTRIES PYRAMID - DAY
A huge open atrium on the ground floor, with marble columns,
fountains, eucalyptus trees -- an Egyptian pleasure garden.
JUSTINE's hanging out with her video crew; they spot VEIDT on the
central escalator and swing into action.

JUSTINE
Adrian!  Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?

He's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and
secretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the
cameras.

VEIDT
No comment.

JUSTINE
Did you know he was back on the streets?

VEIDT
I did not.  Now get out of my way!

JUSTINE
Isn't it true that you --

He keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he
STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a
pillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.

ASSASSIN
VEIDT!

VEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and
comes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's
agility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY
in his hands.

He swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a
FOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.

As the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and
slams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King
Tut.

VEIDT
Son of a bitch.  Who sent you?

Arms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's
hair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.

SECURITY GUARD
Stand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!

VEIDT
He's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you
scum, I want to know who sent you!

The ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down
into the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.

VEIDT
Goddammit . . .

SECURITY GUARD
Who'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?

VEIDT
I don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.

142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK
TIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.

NEWSCASTER
-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating
fears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside
St. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from
morning Mass --

A PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,
reaches for the receiver.

DREIBERG
Yeah.
(beat)
Adrian!  What's up?

143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG
VEIDT
In have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it
on the news.
(beat)
Someone tried to kill me today.

For a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether
surprised.

DREIBERG
Who?

VEIDT
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm
starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?

DREIBERG
She's with me.

VEIDT
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.
(beat)
Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until
all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.

DREIBERG
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.

He hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.
LAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off
her hair.

LAURIE
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?

DREIBERG
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.
(beat)
. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.

He doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks
up on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away
from him and steadies herself against a bureau.

DREIBERG
-- What is it.

LAURIE
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't
around.

DREIBERG
Laurie --

LAURIE
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --

DREIBERG
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.

His sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,
fed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over
behind her.

LAURIE
I shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told
you --

But before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from
behind.

DREIBERG
Laurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than
anything else in the world.

CUT TO:

144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
CONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving
area.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward
the dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby
tables:

VOICE
Hey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --

VOICE II
Rorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --

Low, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH
picks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The
smallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.

GOON I
Didn't know he was such a tiny little thing.

GOON II
Little?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.

RORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A
SERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.

GOON III
I'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .
.

GOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.

GOON III (cont.)
Notched up some big names over the years.

Suddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of
his dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III
follows.

The others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving
counter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings
a KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and
tumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,
into a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.

Landing on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH
uses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON
II lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby
burner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with
HOT COOKING FAT.

All this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two
disfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked
and smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in
with billy clubs drawn.

As the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It
sounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.

CUT TO:

145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT
A prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --
delivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of
the cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are
totally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal
doors.

At a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,
then throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of
RORSCHACH.

TRUSTY
Hey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'
man.
(beat)
Their friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .
this whole place blows.

RORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The
TRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.

TRUSTY (cont.)
I'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --

RORSCHACH
I'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.

With that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.

CUT TO:

146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
LONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a
square table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED
WIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.

Through a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across
the table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of
inkblots as before, the ""butterfly"" leading off.  But this time, the
subject has decided to cooperate:

RORSCHACH
A whore fucking.

DR. LONG
Who is she?  Do you know her?

Too obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the ""nice
flowers"":

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Man's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.

LONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Doggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --
(pause; then, smiling)
-- with his skull split open.

DR. LONG
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?

RORSCHACH
Why, doctor.  I did.
(beat)
He was a bad dog.

RORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass
tacks.

DR. LONG
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In
your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?

RORSCHACH
God isn't there to do it.

DR. LONG
We don't know that.

RORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.

DR. LONG
So the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?
(no response)
You tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why
would you want to kill a dog?

With LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:

RORSCHACH
One night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.

147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
Ruined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for
the distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues
OVER SCENE:

RORSCHACH (V.O.)
'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no
word.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to
intervene.

The lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up
his collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a
ramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Got a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.

He peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO
HUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen
object.

148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
A DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,
flicks on a flashlight.

Mannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The
light shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders
over.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and
on the floor, a ROPE.

There's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,
sticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a
charred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with
balloons and teddy bears.

He stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden
CHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding
paraphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's
knives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh
WINDOW.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Dogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had
gone.

149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)
The German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the
dogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB
OF BONE.

RORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)
Decided to wait for the owner . . .

150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
Keys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN
enters and whistles to the dogs.

FAT MAN
Fred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--

RORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.

151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
RORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the
story.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his
reply, asks:

DR. LONG
Then what happened?

RORSCHACH
. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had
to break in.

152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
The FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's
handcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a
GROCERY SACK.

He kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off
his glove and reaches into the sack.

FAT MAN
What -- what are you d--

RORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER
into his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he
spends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,
throat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's
done, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER
BLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.

FRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,
and -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs
inside.

Then he stands back and enjoys the carnage.

153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
DR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things
up.

RORSCHACH
When they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their
skulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.
(leaning forward)
See, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed
her . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,
he did't seem to mind.

DR. LONG
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --

RORSCHACH
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make
it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.
(slight smile)
What else can I illuminate?

LONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the
PRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he
points a finger at LONG's inkblot.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
No right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .
just a man's face.
(pause)
See it now?

The GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a
couple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a
second he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he
STOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern
on top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.

LONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the
Rorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.

DISSOLVE TO:

154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK
A rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls
up outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to
the padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.

After a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.

LAURIE
Enough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?

DREIBERG
Memory lane.

He opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.

155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER
Inside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.

LAURIE
Daniel . . .

DREIBERG
Gimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.

She goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull
it back to reveal . . .

THE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit
tarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.
DREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around
to join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.

LAURIE
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.

DREIBERG
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.

156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on
the electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,
reliving days gone by.

LAURIE
Wow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?

DREIBERG
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some
cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.

LAURIE
Antarctica??

DREIBERG
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come
along.
(pause)
I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a
bad place to sit out a war.

LAURIE
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be
left.

DREIBERG
You and me.

He looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her
gaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the
cabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly
rejected.

DREIBERG
. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there
anyway.

Behind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just
opened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES
-- their old superhero togs.

LAURIE
Dan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.

DREIBERG
Me neither.  Mine barely even fits.
(chuckling)
The thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping
people, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't
know.  It all seems so abstract.

LAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing
herself in a small mirror above a sink.

LAURIE
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.

DREIBERG
What are you up to?

LAURIE
Don't look.  Turn around.

Smirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the
cabin.

DREIBERG
This'd better not be what I think it is.

LAURIE
Okay!

DREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite
imposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns
shock:

DREIBERG (cont.)
My God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender
of the weak!

LAURIE
In the flesh.

She ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,
and strokes his thinning hair.

LAURIE (cont.)
Poor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.

DREIBERG
Saving the world?  I guess I do.
(smiling)
Maybe we can still save ourselves . . .

DISSOLVE TO:

157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK
A massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned
out; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met
by CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous
BOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and
hawks, they're all frightened as hell.

Things are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.
The end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to
happen.

MAN ON STAGE
You know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're
sitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --
a first strike!

VOICE IN CROWD
You think the reds ain't doing the same thing?

MAN ON STAGE
Then for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But
we can't stop it!!

VOICE IN CROWD II
It's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!

VOICE IN CROWD III
Dr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!

VOICE IN CROWD IV
It's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!

A HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:

HECKLER
Russia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us
no mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!

MAN ON STAGE
You think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the
end of the world!!

The two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the
stage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start
swinging rifle butts.

As PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of
HOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --
outfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials
""CTU""

158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
CTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.

CTU CAPTAIN
I've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.

159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
PANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their
midst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.

LOUDSPEAKER
CEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.

A couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,
turn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling
rocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.

CUT TO:

160. INT. BARN - DUSK
DREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,
wiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:

DREIBERG
Guess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?

No reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.

161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
LAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her
face is distraught, agonized.

LAURIE
Daniel, you ought to take a look at this.

Onscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the
CTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs
below.

DREIBERG
What the hell -- ?

LAURIE
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.

DREIBERG
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.

He turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.

LAURIE
They're just mowing 'em down.
(pause)
This is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we

CUT TO:

162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>
We're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE
OWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,
like the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws
closer, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out
NIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.

There's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless
motions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as
the Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy
equivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --

-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE
TRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the
action QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in
full-color and real-time --

163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the
Watchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.
Seaport!

164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.

DREIBERG
Okay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.

On the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.

165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT
A RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.

CTU RADAR MAN
Sir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .

The ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --

166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT
-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured
ship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets
sputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against
the water.

167. ANGLE ON CROWD
pointing at the skies in disbelief.

VOICE IN CROWD
LOOK!  UP THERE!

VOICE IN CROWD II
Oh my God, it's --


168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG
He barks into a microphone:

DREIBERG
Attention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --

169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK
Ground level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the
OWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!

CTU LOUDSPEAKER
UNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.

OWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER
BABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.

The crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But
a dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the
strange sight overhead.

VOICE IN CROWD
. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!

EXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,
clumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging
immobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West
showdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate
into position.

170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.

DREIBERG
We're gonna have to shave this one close.

An instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle
FULL-FORWARD.

171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
With a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS
CONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond
before -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES
FORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD
CHEERS.

172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
DREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the
aft view from the ship.

LAURIE
They're following us.

DREIBERG
All right.  Mission accomplished.

He's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the
ship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.

173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU
SHIPS rip past on either side.

174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT
ASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The
OWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE
blows a HOLE in its facade.

175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP
firing TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.

176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar
readout:

LAURIE
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!

DREIBERG
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.

LAURIE
(checking the monitor)
They're practically on us . . .

DREIBERG
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.

He punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled ""TURBO.""

177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP
The turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving
the CTU craft in the dust.

178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT
A line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,
and -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.

A moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The
less-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and
EXPLODES

The SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last
moment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP
ITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles
for the airborne route.

179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER
The OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the
cars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.

There's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges
UP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS
against the roof of the tunnel.

180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The end of the tunnel is coming up fast.

DREIBERG
Fog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.

181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an
almost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its
wake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --
but, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward
on a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the
water.

182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
They're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of
intense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.

LAURIE
We lost him.

He flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she
shakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.

LAURIE (cont.)
Oh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.

FADE THROUGH TO:

183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT
The usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving
line.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall
and falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of
him.

TRUSTY
Just left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.

The CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes
through the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,
it's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named
T-BONE.

CON IN LINE
Otis went down.

T-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of
SIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the
biggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:
LITTLE BIGGER.

T-BONE
Just heard, boss.  Otis bought it.

LITTLE BIGGER
Fuckin' Rorschach.
(nodding to himself)
This joint goes up.  Tonight.

184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
Drifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship
emerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale
blue moonlight.

185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
Through the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then
disappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour
of the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is
singing ""You're My Thrill.""

Instruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the
controls.

The ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the
width of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it
right.

It's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.
The pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the
cabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.

LAURIE
Better.  Much better.

DREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile
instead.

LAURIE (cont.)
I bet I know what made the difference this time.

DREIBERG
What?

LAURIE
(smirking)
The costumes.  Am I right?

DREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite
himself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.

LAURIE (cont.)
Come on.  Admit it!

DREIBERG
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.

LAURIE
Yes you are.

DREIBERG
(drily)
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.
(pause; then, seriously)
Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.

LAURIE
That's because --

DREIBERG
It's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's
about to end.
(a weird smile)
I feel like I could save it.

He grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to
the instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship
hard right.

LAURIE
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?

DREIBERG
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .
(turning to face her)
I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.

LAURIE
. . . What??

DREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches
for the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.

186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
AFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through
the clouds above the city.

CUT TO:

187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON
-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL
as we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:
disabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,
throwing food.

188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are
riveted to a monitor over the controls:

DREIBERG
I think we're just a trifle late.

LAURIE
Jesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .

The MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below
them.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire
with the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.

DREIBERG
I know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen
times.

189. INT. CELL - NIGHT
SIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs
drawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.

190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT
Smoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past
sprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR
MENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the
psychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,
and T-BONE.

Wheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop
outside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.

LITTLE BIGGER
Find an outlet for this thing
(shouting)
Rorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!

RAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying
a big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's
door, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.

CARLOS
See this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .
and pickle 'em!!
(chortling)
Aww!  I think he just wet his pants!

HILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place
at the panel in the door:

T-BONE
Lemme see.  Lemme see!

LITTLE BIGGER
Relax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.
(to T-BONE)
What's he doin' now?

No response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed
tightly to the panel.

LITTLE BIGGER (cont.)
You deaf?  I said, what's he --

He gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over
backwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON
quivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye
socket.

RAFE
BOSS!  JESUS!

LITTLE BIGGER
Son of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE
A GRAPE.
(to RAFE)
Light the torch.

RAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of
RORSCHACH's cage.

191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
RORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the
inside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.

CUT TO:

192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic
EARMUFFS.

DREIBERG
Okay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof
running . . .

He throws a switch on the control panel.

193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
WINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH
splits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop
their weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as
the Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .

194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT
The LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S
FACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the
wall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his
TOILET.

Grunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its
mounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is
FLOODED.

195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER
RAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.

RAFE
Okay, boss, that oughta do it.

They give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER
come gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.

LITTLE BIGGER
WHAT THE --

RAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but
there's no trace of RORSCHACH.

CARLOS
Rorschach.  Company's calling . . .

RAFE
Where is the fuckin' runt?

CARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his
fist.

196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT
In answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.
He SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of
the LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .

. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,
monkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide
and an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.

CARLOS
YOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --

From the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor
BETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --

-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --

-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do
a herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --

-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock
DIM and DIE.

LITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down
off his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies
of the dead.

RORSCHACH
Your move . . . runt.

The midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor
as fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.

197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to
get their bearings.

LAURIE
Where are we?  What happened to the lights?

DREIBERG
Generators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .
. .

Their heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND
CORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a
SCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.

DREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a
familiar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.

DREIBERG
. . . Rorschach??

RORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second
and a half -- then keeps on walking.

198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER
The terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He
throws a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.
Desperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.

RORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,
LAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross
corridor.

LAURIE
Rorschach!  Is that you??

He turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and
dispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand
at the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.

LAURIE
What's he doing?

DREIBERG
I think he's going to the john.

LAURIE
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and
he stops to take a --

Before she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a
paper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a
""howdy.""

DREIBERG
. . . That was quick.

RORSCHACH
Toilet clogged.  Short fat turd.
(beat)
Let's get out of here.

CUT TO:

199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT
A well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky
Mountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.

Air Force One is coming in for a landing.

200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER
Lots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling
about.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.

SECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and
what looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal
ramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an
imposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating
a long stay.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Hello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?

SECRETARY LIDDY
She's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right
away.

LIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless
corridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.

SECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)
Weatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour
window.

PRESIDENT NIXON
Fourteen hours, huh?

SECRETARY LIDDY
Fourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.

CUT TO:

201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
LAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen
. . .

NEWSCASTER
-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place
the one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --

. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control
console, occupied by other matters.

DREIBERG
I don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his
mangy cat on me.

DREIBERG
What new information?

RORSCHACH
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan
somehow involved . . .
(scratching his chin)

Strange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.

There's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,
highly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.

DREIBERG
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.

LAURIE
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?

Still grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at
the monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the
screen:

NEWSCASTER
. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was
unavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the
Antarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.

RORSCHACH
""Ozone layer""?

DREIBERG
(rolling his eyes)
Christ.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??

CUT TO:

202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of
pristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous
strip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered
around what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is
one.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.

203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT
The entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian
style as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad
figure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered
LYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.
One of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a
silver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back
of the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.

LACKEY
Welcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.

VEIDT
Feed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.

They hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him
to:

204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT
The room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated
REMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,
RED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.

VEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal
a towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,
picking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more
informational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,
a hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in
and his eyes begin to rove.

205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL
PANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,
sitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled ""LONDON.""
VEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE
comes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense
logo . . .

BBC NEWSCASTER
-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as
possible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter
can be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --

FLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to
the right, to the monitor labelled ""WASHINGTON D.C.""  Sound up:

NEWSCASTER
-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have
already been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen
insist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing
negotiations --

FLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the
bottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic
retreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new
angle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are
clear.  FLICK --

-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're
watching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from
twenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas
canteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to
propose.

206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT
eyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.

CUT TO:

207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT
LOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.
On its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.

208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
DREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of
the city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,
gradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,
POLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.

DREIBERG
They've got my building surrounded.
(looking up at her)
They must've been following you all along.

She stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the
accelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.

DREIBERG (cont.)
So much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.

LAURIE
Welcome back, Night Owl.

DREIBERG
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?

RORSCHACH
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.

DREIBERG
What do you mean, frame-up?

RORSCHACH
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --

DREIBERG
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to
get back at us?
(spreading his hands)
What about all those poor shits with cancer?

TIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting
distress.

RORSCHACH
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive
propaganda scheme . . .

DREIBERG
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --

LAURIE
(interrupting him)
It's not.

RORSCHACH
Not what?

LAURIE
Not ""propaganda.""
(pause; then, blurting it out --)
Christ, I'm one of them!  I've got it.

DREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face
bone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her
grim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can
think of anything to say.

Then RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the ""case,"" breaks the
silence.

RORSCHACH
Hnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.

209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
RORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he
pries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily
at a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers
above.

210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
DREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.

LAURIE
I should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between
us to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --

DREIBERG
It doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.

He tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up
with tears.

LAURIE
I love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get
myself together, okay?

211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.
RORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of
satisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees
DREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.

Above their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.

212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
LAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona
resolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.

LAURIE
Jon.  What are you doing here?

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.

LAURIE
Collect me?

DR. MANHATTAN
In the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.
You're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .

LAURIE
Jon, no -- I can't --

DR. MANHATTAN
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us
can do anything to change it.

DREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside
the cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.
MANHATTAN's hand.

DREIBERG
LAURIE!  DON'T --

Hands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and
LAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.

Stunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can
do.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.

RORSCHACH
Where's Laurie?

DREIBERG
I don't think she's coming with us.

DISSOLVE TO:

213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT
A BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian
surface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later
LAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,
then GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red
sands.

DR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a
problem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at
the air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back
and extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by
a HALO OF OXYGEN.

DR. MANHATTAN
The atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.

LAURIE
Jesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --

Ignoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she
stops in her tracks.

Before her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a
PALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren
sands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,
surrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and
pendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering
crystalline castle.

DR. MANHATTAN
I live here now.

He strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after
him.

CUT TO:

214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT
TIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the
glow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.

RORSCHACH
Heading south.  What's the plan?

DREIBERG
We're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're
hightailing it down to Adrian's.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --

DREIBERG
(exploding)
Cases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to
end.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't
matter.

RORSCHACH
Coward.  Giving up.

DREIBERG
SHUT UP, Rorschach.

RORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.

RORSCHACH
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.
(pause)
Sorry about Laurie.

DREIBERG
(choked voice)
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.

For a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well
enough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.

RORSCHACH
Veidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.

CUT TO:

215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
LAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals
around the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the
enormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING
-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.

LAURIE
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me
you're sleeping with Dreiberg.

LAURIE
You -- you know about me and Dan?

He gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.

DR. MANHATTAN
Time is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll
finally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.

LAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.

LAURIE
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?
(flustered)
Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks
at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of
atoms.

DR. MANHATTAN
(startled)
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?

LAURIE
Well, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.

DR. MANHATTAN
That's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even
my responses.
(nodding)
We're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --
Thirty seconds.

She GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle
of the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles
below them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent
WIND whips across their faces.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way
out toward the edge of the universe.
(staring out at the landscape)
Utterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?

She moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and
fissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and
frightened.

LAURIE
Jon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me
once?

DR. MANHATTAN
Yes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.

LAURIE
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be
being with me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't
know what did.

LAURIE
But you knew that I'd -- die.

DR. MANHATTAN
Memories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to
dwell on the unpleasant ones . . .
(pause)
You won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.

LAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.

LAURIE
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've
always known.

DR. MANHATTAN
(nodding)
Always.  Ever since the day I died.

He walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the
forbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in
her hands.

DR. MANHATTAN (cont.)
Do you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me
these last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be
destroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless
agent of its destruction?

LAURIE
(sobbing)
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!

DR. MANHATTAN
Because --

LAURIE
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.
(angrily)
Jon.  This, this ""script"" you're following . . . who writes it?

DR. MANHATTAN
I don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six
hundred years.

That about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the
shoulders:

LAURIE
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to
die I want to be with -- other people.

DR. MANHATTAN
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a
universe to explore.  I'll be alone.
(reaching for her hand)
You're the last human being I'll ever see.

CUT TO:

216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south
Atlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and
begins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .

217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
DREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.
Finally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad
tumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:

RORSCHACH
What happened?

DREIBERG
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some
kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.

RORSCHACH
What caused it?

DREIBERG
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --
(apprehensively)
-- outside of a nuclear blast.

DISSOLVE TO:

218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT
VEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible
through a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.

219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled ³MOSCOW² and ³WASHINGTON, D.C.² -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.

A second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.

220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT
The OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.

221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
Through the cockpit, KARNAK¹s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it¹s lost in the snows again.

DREIBERG
I¹m taking her down.
(frantically throwing switches)
Radar¹s blown.  I¹ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --

The SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.

222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT
The OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.

A HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They¹re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.

223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
VEIDT¹s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.

As he watches, the screens for ³LONDON² and ³PARIS² go WHITE.

224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER
DREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN¹S VOICE announces:

VOICE
Welcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.

DREIBERG
Adrian!  It¹s Dreiberg.  For God¹s sake open the doors.

Nothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.

DREIBERG (cont.)
Adrian!  We¹re freezing to death out here!

He slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.

RORSCHACH
. . . He¹s not coming, Daniel.

225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT
On the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.

The wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, ³PRAGUE² goes white.

226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT
DREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.

DREIBERG
Can¹t move . . . we¹re done for.

RORSCHACH
Come on.  Found an exhaust vent.

RORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.

RORSCHACH (cont.)
Veidt.  It¹s been Veidt all along.  He¹ll pay for this.

227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT
VEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.

TWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.

VEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX
growls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's
neck: quiet, girl.

RORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN
FLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening
scene.  Suddenly . . .

RORSCHACH
VEIDT!

VEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;
it catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG
backs against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward
him, TEETH BARED.

VEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a
futuristic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --
part of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?

RORSCHACH
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --

VEIDT
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of
course . . .

DREIBERG
The missing scientists.

VEIDT
Uh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked
at Gila Flats.

RORSCHACH
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .

VEIDT
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save
the world.

228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT
Gun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.
RORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping
at his heels.

VEIDT
Blake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers
-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.
(tapping his chest)
It was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill
him.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my ""assassination"" --
that was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting
rid of Dr. Manhattan.

DREIBERG
What??

VEIDT
I couldn't let him interfere with my project.

RORSCHACH
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.

VEIDT
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.
(smiling)
He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a
little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates
cancer.

DREIBERG
Laurie?  You're responsible for --

VEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls
out a smoke and strikes it against the box.

VEIDT (cont.)
One thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate
than it is to cure.

DREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the
stun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and
LEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.

VEIDT
Let's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you
without a moment's thought.

They've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200
SCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them
inside.

RORSCHACH
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.

VEIDT
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking
at.

229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER
VEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand
corner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila
Flats, reassembling a WATCH.

DREIBERG
What is this?  It looks like Jon.

VEIDT
It is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.
Manhattan.

DREIBERG
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?

VEIDT
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.

CUT TO:

230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT
DR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,
LAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's
hit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On
Mars.

DR. MANHATTAN
I almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a
mystery I'd like to penetrate.

LAURIE
Jon, I do not want to hear it.

DR. MANHATTAN
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .

LAURIE
(shaking her head)
Oh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.

DR. MANHATTAN
You're the only human being I care for.

LAURIE
Then do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter
a bit.
(pause)
I want you to cure me.

DR. MANHATTAN
I won't do that.

LAURIE
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.

DR. MANHATTAN
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.

LAURIE
Jon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you
-- then do it.

Eyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her
chest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.

Her fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.
MANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the
hardest decision of his life.  And then . . .

A BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN
INTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian
landscape altogether.

With a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see
the figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great
white VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the
Martian desert gradually materialize around them.

The two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like
statues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.

LAURIE
What -- am I --

DR. MANHATTAN
Cured, yes.

Utterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a
handrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart
attack.

LAURIE
Jon, what is it?  What's the matter?

When he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with
DREAD.

DR. MANHATTAN
Something. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on
me.  -- I can't remember the future.

Slowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around
him.

LAURIE
Jon.  Let's go back to Earth.

CUT TO:

231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT
VEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.
room at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring
machinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.

Inside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON
OSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into
its brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching
him from twenty-four years in the future.

VEIDT
Gentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.
(pause)
Stand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.

DREIBERG
What is it?  How does it work?

VEIDT
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow
backward in time.
(smiling)
There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing
parallel to our own --

DREIBERG
Adrian -- you've lost it.

VEIDT
(pointing at the tachyon bubble)
I've seen them!  I've seen them in there.
(pause)

In some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it
survives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.

He draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.

VEIDT (cont.)
The creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.
(wild-eyed)
Do you understand now?  Do you see what I¹m going to do?  I¹m going to change the past!

232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT
DR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.

LAURIE
We¹re too late.

DR. MANHATTAN
It¹s very strange.  Time¹s flowing backwards . . .

LAURIE
Jon -- what??

DR. MANHATTAN
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.

233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
Inside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY¹s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.

VEIDT
At first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.

He steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.

VEIDT
It ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.
(turning to face them)
In a minute I¹ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I¹ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman¹s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.

DREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.

RORSCHACH
. . . And they call me a fucking nut.

DREIBERG
Adrian.  It¹s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.

VEIDT
Don¹t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won¹t even be here, will we?

DREIBERG
And what if you¹re wrong?

VEIDT
I¹m not.

DREIBERG
What if you¹re wrong??

VEIDT
Then I¹ve been a very bad boy and you¹ll have to spank me.  Christ!
(shouting)
I¹m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!

234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
A POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
That¹s it.  That¹s the source of the time disturbance.

LAURIE
Jon, where are we?

DR. MANHATTAN
Veidt¹s complex.

235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT

Twenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler¹s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:

VEIDT
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years
chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .
as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.

DREIBERG
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist
bullshit is going to save the world?

VEIDT
We'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.

He kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.
Then he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.

236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS
In the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears
a SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .

237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT
A LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon
bubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up
--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the
trigger . . .

. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.
VEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .

. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with
LAURIE at his side.

DR. MANHATTAN
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?

VEIDT
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.

DR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees
himself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of
the I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's
surprised.

In the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to
sidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN
THE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.

VEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He
shoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and
points his STUN GUN directly at her --

-- and a millisecond later, he¹s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.

VEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN¹s outstretched finger --

VEIDT
NO!!!!

-- and in the wink of an eye, he¹s VAPORIZED.  All that¹s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.

DREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.

LAURIE
What was he doing?

DREIBERG
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --

DR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.

DR. MANHATTAN
He was right.

RORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.

DR. MANHATTAN
He did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It¹s so elegant.  It¹s so obvious.

DR. MANHATTAN¹s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.

LAURIE
Jon --

DR. MANHATTAN
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.

LAURIE
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?

DR. MANHATTAN
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!

He lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz
around his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the
room dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the
world into his own massive frame.

DR. MANHATTAN
My work here is finished . . .

The others cower.  They sense that something large is about to
happen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the
test chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the
tiny
hole in time.

He does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS
into a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND
STEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.

238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT
JON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter
bewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling
gloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.

DR. MANHATTAN
Don't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.

A second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps
forward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.

For a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame
surrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.
MANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the
chamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across
the shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he
spreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding
FLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging
with nothingness . . .

. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue
light dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's
alive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.

239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER
The timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of
his awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation
panel.

SCIENTIST
What in the name of God . . .

The SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,
sobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As
she clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he
looks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .

JON
Your watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --

SCIENTIST II
LOOK!!

The SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .
. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular
RUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are
three odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and
RORSCHACH.

240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT
DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the
astounded SCIENTISTS.

LAURIE
What happened -- ?

DREIBERG
He saved himself.  He changed the past.

LAURIE
Where did he go?

Before DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to
THROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For
a moment everything's back to normal --

-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to
DISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.

A sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around
them, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge
into . . .

241. EXT. VORTEX EFFECT
DREIBERG, LAURIE and RORSCHACH spinning and tumbling through an
otherdimensional funhouse of sound and color.  If space and time
could be compressed into a single extravagant E-ticket joyride, this
would be it.  Their bodies contract and distend, warp and elongate;
their tortured mouths emit soundless shrieks; and then, before they
know it, they find themselves deposited --

242. EXT. NEW YORK STREET - NIGHT
-- smack in the middle of a busy intersection.  The three of them
materialize from nowhere; a southbound VAN swerves to avoid them,
slamming into a row of parked cars, and a northbound TAXICAB does the
same, knocking over a fire hydrant.

LAURIE
Dan, is this -- is this New York??

DREIBERG
Those cars.  What year is this??

LAURIE
Everything's changed --

It's a disorienting world they've landed in.  In fact, it's
our world, our New York, and everything -- the cars,
the clothing, the very look of the city -- seems just a trifle out of
whack . . .

RORSCHACH
Hnrrrrr -- we never happened.

BYSTANDERS cluster about, laughing and taunting, highly amused by the
obvious puzzlement of the freakish trio in their midst.  There are, of
course, no costumed heroes in our world, and their sudden
presence prompts a Babel of speculation among the onlookers:
Nuts?  Fruits?  Out-of-work actors?

RORSCHACH takes a swing at one of the curious, who gets a touch too
close, and the mood begins to turn hostile.  The CROWD, now grown to
several dozen people, is threatening to block the intersection
altogether; a MOUNTED POLICEMAN rides up on his stallion and blows a
shrill WHISTLE.

DREIBERG
Oh my God, they still ride around on horses!

243. EXT. NEWSSTAND - THAT MOMENT
The same newsstand we've seen all along -- but luckily, here in our
world, the headlines are only mildly discouraging: ""RUSSIAN SUMMIT
TALKS COLLAPSE.""  Like everyone else, our old friend the NEWS VENDOR
is gapin at the ruckus on the street.

NEWS VENDOR
Jesus Christ, it must be Halloween.

His sidekick, the small black KID who reads comic books, points to
the befuddled trio on the street and LAUGHS in gleeful recognition.

KID
Shit, man!  It's Rorschach!  And Night Owl!

NEWS VENDOR
What are you talkin' about?

KID
Superheroes!  Check it out!

He thrusts a COMIC BOOK into the NEWS VENDOR's hand and races off to
join the growing throng of rubberneckers.  The NEWS VENDOR stares
down at the costumed characters in the comic book -- ""WATCHMEN"" --
then throws a cockeyed squint at their real-life counterparts on the
street.

KID
All right!  They must be on a case.

244. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT
HORNS BLARE.  ALL TRAFFIC HAS STOPPED.  The intersection is mobbed
with curious ONLOOKERS.  By now a half-dozen BEAT COPS have arrived
to clear the streets and restore order.

COP I
Break it up!  Stand back!

COP II
Come on, you three.  If this is some kind of publicity stunt --

DREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH have fallen into a tight circle.
They don't know what to expect and they're poised for a brawl.  The
taunting crowd gives them plenty of room; even the COPS are hesitant
to advance.

LAURIE
Dan -- what do we do now?

DREIBERG
(panicked)
Wherever we are, it's better than what we left.  Backs together --

LAURIE
We'll tell them what's happened.  They'll listen to reason, won't
they -- ?

RORSCHACH
They'd better.

And on RORSCHACH's final vicious HISS, we SHOCK CUT TO BLACK and

FADE OUT.

809,2008,Coldplay,Viva La Vida,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Turn me on how you stare at me when we through
When you give it to me, I don't wanna turn ya loose
Scared to moan 'round you, so all I can say is ""ooh""

Never told her or let her know it but she the best
She like to spell her name wit her tongue on my chest
If you'da told me it was this good, I'da never guessed
She full of surprises, I don't know what she'll do next
But while she sleep I sneak and put hickies on her neck
And when she go out, she shut down the whole set
Love to see her in heels wit the slit in her dress
She like to do her own hair and get her own checks
My BUST IT BA-BY, I keep her on deck

Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max

[Verse 1: Fern]
Call me OG with the young flow
Allen Iverson, no practice
That’s KD on the winning team
Got my wrist game on all axis’s
That’s big dream since the Dream Team
Now I’m on one like March Madness
Flow hot, make the climate change
Melt them polar caps causing raging weathers
I’m young enough to like slip and slide in my backyard but I never slip
Wordsmith since day one
Write a verse like a screen play
Michael Bates spitting A-1 for the sonic youth like I’m Green Day
In the field like Green Bay
Catching plays, it’s a field day
My grind game, my mind state
Well seasoned that's Garry Vee
Rap game got it locked down but I never asked it to marry me
And I’m cooking verses so legendary
This garlic parmesan, lemon pepper
This Wing Stop call it chicken dinner
This that well done and you can tell the difference
Ok, I know
[Chorus: Chris Batson]
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max

[Verse 2: Marty]
It’s Marty baby
I don’t care who your boss is
I run through the office, run through the offense
I don’t got a off switch on my awesomeness
Every beat like a Contra cartridge
Awkward with a little bit of Ye'
Pull up to a hater like aye
(Seriously, this is like the fourth song I’ve interrupted
If you don’t like our music you’re dead inside)
Saw a fight like celebrity death match
Battle any rapper who have negative feedback
Batman, Year One with a ski mask
I'm good in the hood, that’s a G pass
I don’t look back, I don’t recap
You say you the best, I don’t see that
I lost some friends that I need back
I pray so hard I need knee pads
I’m Larry David to the haters
On the way to be your favorite
On the way to see the Lakers
Never got robbed by the majors
Used to get robbed by the neighbors
I really want to make this clear
Yeah, every year is our year
Swear it’s not even fair
[Chorus: Chris Batson]
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now

‘Cause you’re that type that drive a man crazy
And snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back

Once you expose that thing you do

And I let him call me baby

819,2008,Sara Bareilles,Love Song,"[Verse 1]
Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
(Yeah) Today, yeah

[Verse 2]
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
[Pre-Chorus]
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today

[Bridge]
Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...

[Chorus]
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Ooh)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? (Yeah)
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song (Write you a love song)
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you (I want you) to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas (Walk the seven seas)
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you (Write you) a love song today
Today (Yeah), yeah"
820,2008,Katy Perry,I Kissed A Girl,"[Verse 1]
This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Verse 2]
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

[Bridge]
Us girls, we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist, so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

[Chorus]
I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong, it felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it"

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

[Verse 2]
They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run 'til you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down
[Chorus]
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're here not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

[Verse 1]
As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face-to-face

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye

Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by (As time goes by)
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you

827,2008,David Cook,The World I Know,"Why haven’t you done an interview until now?
I felt like I had nothing to say. I still feel I have nothing to say. I’m the most boring person to talk to.

So why now? Is your label pushing you to do press for the album?
No, labels always push. I mean, Trilogy was a rerelease, but they still said, “Maybe you should do some interviews.” Honestly, I want to do interviews now because it’s one thing that I haven’t mastered. Even Prince did interviews. Michael did interviews. And I can tell in the interviews they’re uncomfortable. Why are they doing this? Because they feel like they have to do it to be a complete artist. I felt like this was my time. And maybe I wouldn’t have done it if I thought you were an asshole. I probably would have been like, “Fuck this guy.”

Is the air of mystery intentional?
Yes and no. In the beginning, I was very insecure. I hated how I looked in pictures. I just fucking hated this shit, like, crop me out of this picture right now. I was very camera shy. People like hot girls, so I put my music to hot girls and it just became a trend. The whole “enigmatic artist” thing, I just ran with it. No one could find pictures of me. It reminded me of some villain shit. But you can’t escape the Internet. There are super fans, and I was really testing their patience. At the end of the day you can’t deny the music. That was my whole thing: I’m going to let the music speak for itself. I’ll show them that this is what I do. But I’m very good at letting shit slide. If I wasn’t…

—you’d go crazy.
I feel like I’m already crazy. I just wouldn’t be able to focus on my music. If I didn’t let shit slide, I’d probably still be working on Echoes of Silence right now. But, I know how to let go of bullshit. And I know how to let go of unmixed and unmastered records. But not anymore. To me, this is my first album. Kiss Land is definitely my first album.

A fresh start.
Yeah, that’s why I didn’t want to mix and master House of Balloons or Thursday or Echoes of Silence. I didn’t feel like they were my albums. Those were my mixtapes.

It was a hell of a mixtape.
Yeah, man. I just wanted to make the greatest mixtape of all time, that’s all. And if I didn’t, I definitely made the longest mixtape of all time. [Laughs.]

Which of the three resonates with you the most?
House of Balloons is the most important for me because I spent the most time on it. I didn’t have a deadline for that. As soon as I put House of Balloons out, I let the world know I’m coming out with two more albums this year, so I had my own little deadline. Before House of Balloons, it was all freedom.

House of Balloons was actually supposed to have more songs than it does. I had so many records left, and then Take Care came through. “Crew Love,” “Shot for Me,” and “The Ride” were supposed to be on House of Balloons. I wanted to come out with like 14 records. I felt like “The Ride” was the last one, and it wasn’t done yet. [Drake] heard it and he was like, “This shit’s crazy.”

How did you give it to him? Was it just an instrumental?
Yeah, we were making the drum loop and...oh, man, I had smoked I don’t know how much weed. Even Drake, he came into that session and we were all smoked out. It was terrible how much weed smoke was in that room. I was surprised I could even hit a note. I had sung this melody—it wasn’t a hook, just an unfinished lyric. And he liked it so much, he was like, “I need to have this, man.... I know I’ve already taken ‘Shot for Me’ and ‘Crew Love’ and this and that.” And me, I was hungry at that time. I was like, “Dude, take anything.” At that point I was like, “Hell, yeah.”
In your mind, what was “The Ride” supposed to be?
There are two ways of making music for me. There’s a calculated route—like, I know exactly what I’m going to do with this song. And then there’s the free mind. That was one of the free-minded records. It was all subconscious. I’ll make the music first and loop it, and then I’ll go into the booth and start singing almost 45 minutes straight. And these are not words; this is gibberish. It’s a songwriter language. There are lyrics on Thursday, I don’t even know what the fuck I said. “Gone” was a complete freestyle.

Isn’t that like eight minutes long?
[Laughs.] Yeah, exactly. With me, everything is a blank canvas. I’m painting this canvas by whipping the colors. I want to show the world that I can shit out albums like nothing.

The song “Kiss Land” has a new level of musicality and thoughtfulness that seems apropos for your first major label release.
I’m all about evolution. I’m the first person to judge myself. I listen to my music and I’ll be like, “This is shit.” Everyone around me is like, “What the fuck is wrong with you?”

What are some flaws you saw in your past three releases?
Just technical, musical stuff. And, of course, writing. You’re bound to find flaws and repetition when you come out with three albums in one year. At that point I was very cavalier; I didn’t give a shit. Some people realize it and some don’t. Me, I’m very critical.

I’m not here to change or lie about what I’m going to do. What I sing about is what I sing about. But there’s a lot of cool twists with this album, because this album symbolizes everything that I’d never experienced in the past 21 years of my life. I’d never left Toronto. I’d driven to Montreal, but I’d never been on a plane before two or three years ago.

Wow. That’s crazy.
From when I was born to when I was 21, I never left Toronto. That’s why I’m such a city cat. Trilogy is my experiences in those four walls. Kiss Land is me doing the things I did in Trilogy in different settings. [Laughs.]

My favorite of the Trilogy set, which goes against conventional wisdom, is Echoes of Silence.
Really, the last one? Echoes of Silence was made in Montreal. I had a lot of darkness in that city.
My favorite song on that project is “Next.”
That’s an artist’s song. If you’re an artist, you can relate to that record. Especially if you’re in that hip-hop world, “Next” is for you.

It’s that balance of high and low. To start a song off, “She pops that pussy on a Monday.” Where is this going from there?
I’m a huge fan of R. Kelly’s. He’s a musical genius, and probably the most prolific artist of the generation before mine. Some of the lines he says, if you say them in a normal voice, it’s the most disgusting thing you could say to somebody. But I can say “Pussy-ass nigga” in the most elegant and sexiest way ever, and it’s accepted. If I can get away with singing that, I’m doing something right.
All that ignorance on my records — “When she put it in her mouth, she can’t seem to reach my…” — that’s me paying homage to R. Kelly, and even Prince to a certain extent. The things R. Kelly was saying were crazy. You can say it now and it’s nothing, but back then you couldn’t.

Since Trilogy, you’ve made songs with Wiz, Juicy J, French Montana, Drake
They are all friends of mine. Every time Wiz came to Toronto, my friend would take me to his concerts and bring me backstage. To this day, he’s the realest dude ever. So when he asked me to work with him, I did it without hesitation.

When you do a feature for other artists, do you give them an entire song?
With “Crew Love,” it wasn’t like that. Like I said, that was my song. I had a hook and I had a second verse. And Drake heard it and he was like, “Fuck, man.”

There’s a second verse?
Yeah, there was a second verse on it.

You’ve got to play that for me!
I fucking hate that second verse. That was a complete freestyle as well. I’m glad Drake placed his vocals on it. That song was so special to him. I didn’t hear that verse until maybe four or five months after I gave it to him. Even with “The Zone,” I was scared I was going to have to put out Thursday before his verse came in because Drake takes his time. He makes sure that he says the right shit and his flow is on point.

It seems like your work on Take Care was similar to the way Kanye West enlisted Kid Cudi on 808s & Heartbreak.
Or when Jay-Z hit up Kanye for The Blueprint.
Do you think Drake tapped you to give Take Care that feel?
Yeah, he told me he wouldn’t be able to do the album without me. You can read it on the credits that he thanked me. I don’t know if that’s him being generous, but I gave him a lot of records. I made “Practice.”

What did you do on “Practice”?
That whole hook was me. That’s probably the only song I wrote for Take Care. The rest of it was just shit I was going to have for [House of Balloons]. He really wanted to incorporate my sound, which was inspired by his sound. It’s not like, “Oh, I had the ‘new sound.’” It was just easier for him to relate to me, because it was his sound with an edge. It was that Toronto sound. So yeah, you’re right. I feel like I could have been that for his album.

People think you guys aren’t cool with each other anymore.
No, that’s not true. Definitely not true. But it makes sense. The thing about Drake is I told him what my decisions were going to be. And he was down with it from the beginning.
You mean in terms of your label deal?
Everything. I told him from day one what my decision was going to be. I wasn’t going that route. I was going to go my own route. And he supported me.

So when you read things about how you two are not cool…
— he’s like me when it comes to shit like that, too. He loves reading that stuff.

You both just brush it off?
Of course. I don’t like to spoon-feed people. I don’t like to be like, “You know what? I’m going to let the world know that we’re cool. We’re going to take a picture together. Everyone’s cool.” It’s all about the mystery, and people like it. Shit’s WWE, man. It’s wrestling, you know what I mean?
The other rumor is that you two are PartyNextDoor.
[Laughs.] No, no, no, that’s not true at all. I never met him.

Where do you see yourself in the world of R&B?
The only thing R&B about my shit is the style of singing. My inspiration is R. Kelly, Michael Jackson, and Prince, for the vocals anyway. My production and songwriting, and the environment around those vocals are not inspired by R&B at all.

I heard Portishead drums on “Belong to the World.”
Yeah, that was the inspiration behind that. I wrote a letter to the producers of Portishead and let them know this album is inspired by them.

The entire Kiss Land album?
Most of it. I find a sound and run with it. It varies from Stevie Nicks to Genesis and Phil Collins. The production is very cinematic for me, and R&B was never cinematic like that.

Do you have a greater understanding of love on this album?
I don’t know. Like I said, a lot of it’s subconscious.

On “Belong to the World,” it sounds like you may have had a serious relationship.
“Belong to the World” is about falling in love with the wrong person. There are some songs where I talk about the same person, but I like to make every song about someone else. Thursday is a conceptual album. Whatever that situation was, I spent the whole album focusing on that situation.

Have you gone through heartbreak before?
I think I did. I’m not sure. Some people think they go through situations and then it hits them like a fucking brick. I hope that I fell in love and I hope that my heart was broken. Because if I didn’t, then I don’t know what I’m about to go through in the next 20 years of my life.

Last night in the studio you said Kiss Land was a ridiculous title.
Yeah, because Kiss Land symbolizes the tour life, but it’s a world that I created in my head. Just like House of Balloons symbolizes Toronto and my experiences there, but it’s a world that I created. When I think about Kiss Land, I think about a terrifying place. It’s a place I’ve never been to before that I’m very unfamiliar with.

A lot of it is inspired by filmmakers like John Carpenter, David Cronenberg, and Ridley Scott, because they know how to capture fear. That’s what Kiss Land is to me, an environment that’s just honest fear. I don’t know who I am right now and I’m doing all these outlandish things in these settings that I’m not familiar with. To me, it’s the most terrifying thing ever. So when you hear the screams in the record and you hear all these horror references and you feel scared, listen to the music because I want you to feel what I’m feeling. Kiss Land is like a horror movie

Holy shit. That’s the last thing you’d expect from the title.
I didn’t want to call it Dark World or something so generic. The title came from a conversation that I overheard and those words stuck out. Someone said, “Kiss Land” and I thought, “That’s going to be the title of my album.” It sounds so ridiculous. When I put [the title] out everyone was like, “What the hell? This is going to be corny. It’s going to be all lovey-dovey.”

People will say, “It’s a wrap; we lost him.”
But that’s what I want. I want them to be underwhelmed. I’m all about surprises. If you watch a horror movie and it’s called Kiss Land, it’s probably going to be the most terrifying thing you’ve ever seen in your life."

You know by now, I want it more than anything
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

You must be crazy, I got a man, you got a lady
I know, we here together, so this must be something special

The way you touching me like no other
I'ma make you feel insane
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wanting if you keep it up
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rolling up on us (I got you)
I'm not hesitating, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted

I mean, we could do it like a G
On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on
I'm like, shout out to the DJ for playing this song
Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl
And it started with a hug
But now we making love in this club
And we're not gonna stop just because
The people in the crowd are watching us
But we don't give a damn what they say
And this is the, the remix, baby

Come a little closer to daddy, put it on you
Need you to know what happens here, stays here
And I'm ready and willing, almost got to go
Got you standing at attention, keep it on the low
Ain't nobody watching, don't worry, they can't see us
I know I got you hot, now let me in
You in the club or the car, wherever you are
Run and tell the DJ, run it back on replay

Always wear a plastic, baby cause shit happens
She leaked the back seat, just to freak in the Magnum
Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs
She in love with the G, so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Ten black Maybachs back to back in a lane
I'mma make it rain, and I'mma make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie, that's a fact
Workin' with the police, actin' like you know me
Fresh out of jail, already in yo' hoe cheeks

When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, ""Oh, she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs

So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down, who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the highwire

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

[Verse 2]
Out the many broken backdoors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the soul falling down
From the thrones without any innuendos
But you found it a piece for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifters one has a short life
[Chorus]
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

I wanna tell you what you do to think you practice what you preach
Now I know there's nothing we can't reach
'Cause the heart can't erase once it finds a place to be warm and welcome
To be held in shelter

I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me

When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by
[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by

[Verse 4]
These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox
Yeah, with all of these men lining up to get neutered
It's hip now to be feminized
But I don't highlight my hair
I've still got a pair
Yeah, honey, I'm still a guy

Oh, my eyebrows ain't plucked
There's a gun in my truck
Oh, thank God I'm still a guy"

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill
[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Motherfucker, I'm ill

See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac

Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me

Text appears which reads, “...And these children/that you spit on/as they try to change their worlds/are immune to your consultations./They’re quite aware/of what they’re going through.../DAVID BOWIE.”
CUT TO: EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL, DAY
The text on screen shatters and reveals an establishing shot of Shermer High School. Brian’s voice begins to narrate.

BRIAN: Saturday, March 24th, 1984. Shermer High School. Shermer, Illinois, 60062.

Cut to various shots from inside the high school as Brian continues to narrate.

BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon. We accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. What we did was wrong, but we think you’re crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. What do you care? You see us as you want to see us. In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions. You see us as a brain, an athlete, a basket case, princess, and a criminal. Correct? That’s the way we saw each other at seven o’clock this morning. We were brainwashed.

Outside the school, Claire sits in a car with her father.

CLAIRE: I can’t believe you can’t get me out of this. It’s so absurd I have to be here on a Saturday. It’s not like I’m a defective or anything.

Claire’s dad sighs and turns to her.

CLAIRE’S DAD: I’ll make it up to you.

He hands her a bag from the back seat..

CLAIRE’S DAD: Honey, ditching class to go shopping doesn’t make you a defective. Have a good day.
She gets out of the car. Cut to Brian in a car with his mother and younger sister.

BRIAN’S MOM: Is this the first or the last time we do this?

BRIAN: Last.

BRIAN’S MOM: Well, get in there and use the time to your advantage.

BRIAN: Mom, we’re not supposed to study. We just have to sit there and do nothing.

BRIAN’S MOM: Well, mister, you figure out a way to study.

BRIAN’S SISTER: Yeah.

BRIAN’S MOM: Well, go!

He gets out of the car. Cut to Andrew in a car with his dad.

ANDREW’S DAD: Hey, I screwed around. Guys screw around. There’s nothing wrong with that, except you got caught, sport.

ANDREW: Yeah, mom already reamed me, all right?

ANDREW’S DAD: You want to miss a match? You want to blow your ride?

Andrew shakes his head.
ANDREW’S DAD: Now, no school is going to give a scholarship to a discipline case.

Andrew gets out of the car. Andrew’s dad drives away. John walks up and almost gets hit by Allison’s car, but just keeps walking. Allison gets out. She walks to the passenger side, but the car pulls away.
CUT TO: INT. DETENTION ROOM
Claire is seated in the front row. Brian sits in the row behind her. Andrew enters. He gestures to a seat near Claire. She smiles and shrugs, and he sits down. John enters and steals something from a desk. He walks to Brian and gestures for him to move. Brian gets out of his seat and moves to a different one. John pulls out two chairs and lays across them. Allison enters and sits in the far back. Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker. Vernon enters.

VERNON: Well, well. Here we are. I want to congratulate you for being on time.

Claire raises her hand.

CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir? I think there's been a mistake. I know it's detention, but, um... I don't think I belong in here.

Vernon ignores her and checks his watch. As he speaks we see the reactions of the students

VERNON: It is now 7:06. You have exactly 8 hours and 54 minutes to think about why you're here. To ponder the error of your ways. And you may not talk. You will not move from these seats. And you-

He takes one of the chairs John is laying across and moves it.

VERNON: -will not sleep. All right, people, we're gonna try something a little different today. We are going to write an essay of no less than a thousand words describing to me who you think you are.

He hands out paper to the students.

JOHN: Is this a test?
VERNON: And when I say ""essay,"" I mean essay. I do not mean a single word repeated a thousand times. Is that clear, Mr. Bender?

JOHN: Crystal.

VERNON: Good. Maybe you'll learn a little something about yourself. Maybe you'll even decide whether or not you care to return.

Brian raises his hand and stands up.

BRIAN: Uh, you know, I can answer that right now, sir. You know, that'd be ""no."" ""No"" for me, 'cause-

VERNON: Sit down, Johnson.

BRIAN: Thank you, sir.

Brian sits down.

VERNON: My office is right across that hall. Any monkey business is ill-advised. Any questions?

JOHN: Yeah, I got a question. Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?
VERNON: I'll give you the answer to that question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday. Don't mess with the bull, young man. You'll get the horns.
Vernon walks to his office.

JOHN: That man is a brownie hound.

Allison begins loudly biting her nails. The other students look at her. She notices, but doesn’t stop.

JOHN: You keep eating your hand, you're not gonna be hungry for lunch.

She spits a nail at him.

JOHN: I've seen you before, you know.

BRIAN: Who do I think I am? Who are you?

Brian sticks his pen in his mouth and plays with it.
BRIAN: I’m a walrus.
John gives him a look. Brian takes the pen out. John takes off his scarf. They both go to take their jackets off at the same time and stare at each other. Brian relents and leaves his on. John stares intently at Brian.

BRIAN: It’s the shits, huh?

John turns away, then crumples up paper and throws it to the front of the room. He begins humming.

CLAIRE: I can’t believe this is really happening to me.

JOHN: Oh, shit! What are we supposed to do if we have to take a piss?

CLAIRE: Please.

JOHN: If you gotta go, you gotta go.

He unzips his pants.

CLAIRE: Oh, my god.

ANDREW: Hey, you’re not urinating in here, man.

JOHN: Don’t talk, don’t talk. It makes it crawl back up.

ANDREW: You whip it out and you’re dead before the first drop hits the floor.

JOHN: God. You’re pretty sexy when you get angry.

He turns to Brian.

JOHN: Hey, homeboy. Why don’t you go close that door, we’ll get the prom queen impregnated?

ANDREW: Hey. Hey!

JOHN: What?

ANDREW: If I lose my temper you’re totaled, man.

JOHN: Totally?

ANDREW: Totally.

CLAIRE: Why don’t you just shut up? Nobody here is interested.

JOHN: Really.

ANDREW: Buttface.

JOHN: Well hey, sporto, what’d you do to get in here? Forget to wash your jock?

BRIAN: Excuse me, fellas, I think we should just write out papers.

ANDREW: Look, just because you live in here doesn’t give you the right to be a pain in the ass, so knock it off.

JOHN: It’s a free country.

CLAIRE: He’s just doing it to get a rise out of you. Just ignore him.

JOHN: Sweets.

Claire turns to him.

JOHN: You couldn’t ignore me if you tried. So… So, are you guys like, boyfriend-girlfriend? Steady dates? Lovers? Come on, sporto. Level with me. Do you slip her the hot beef injection?

CLAIRE: Go to hell!

ANDREW: Enough!

VERNON: Hey, what’s going on in there?

Vernon sits in his office, reading a newspaper.

VERNON: Spoiled little pricks.

He doesn’t get up. Cut back to the detention room.

ANDREW: Scumbag.

John gets up and sits on a railing.

JOHN: What do you say we close that door? We can't have any kind of party with Vernon checking us out every few seconds.

BRIAN: You know, the door's supposed to stay open.

JOHN: So what?

ANDREW: So why don't you just shut up? There's four other people in here, you know.

JOHN: God, you can count. See, I knew you had to be smart to be a, a wrestler.

ANDREW: Who the hell are you to judge anybody, anyway?

CLAIRE: Really.

ANDREW: You know, Bender, you don't even count. I mean if you disappeared forever it wouldn't make any difference. You may as well not even exist at this school.

JOHN: Well, I'll just run right out and join the wrestling team. Maybe the prep club, too. Student council.

ANDREW: Nah. They wouldn't take you.

JOHN: I'm hurt.

CLAIRE: You know why guys like you knock everything?

JOHN: Oh, this should be stunning.

CLAIRE: It's 'cause you're afraid.

JOHN: Oh, God. You richies are so smart; that's exactly why I'm not heavy in activities.

CLAIRE: You're a big coward.

BRIAN: I'm in the math club.

CLAIRE: See, you're afraid that they won't take you. You don't belong, so you just have to dump all over it.

JOHN: Well, it wouldn't have anything to do with you activities people being assholes, now would it?

CLAIRE: Well you wouldn't know; you don't even know any of us.

JOHN: Well, I don't know any lepers, either, but I'm not gonna run out and join one of their fucking clubs.

ANDREW: Uh, let's watch the mouth, huh?

BRIAN: Um, uh, this is a Club, too.

JOHN: Excuse me a sec. What are you babbling about?

BRIAN: Well, what I’d said was, I'm in the Math Club, uh, the Latin Club, and the Physics Club. Physics Club.

JOHN: Hey, Cherry. Do you belong to the Physics Club?

CLAIRE: That's an academic club.

JOHN: So?

CLAIRE: So, academic clubs aren't the same as other kinds of clubs.

JOHN: Ah, but to dorks like him, they are. What do you guys do in your club?

BRIAN: In physics, well, we, we, uh, we talk about physics. Uh, properties of physics.

JOHN: So it's sort of social. Demented and sad, but social, right?

BRIAN: Yeah, well, I guess you could consider it a social situation. I mean, there are other children in my club, and at the end of the year, we have, we have, you know, a big banquet at the Hilton.

JOHN: You load up, you party.

BRIAN: Well, no, well, we get dressed up. I mean, but we don’t get high.

CLAIRE: Only burners like you get high.

BRIAN: And I didn’t have any shoes, so I had to borrow my dad’s. It was kind of weird because my mom doesn’t like me to wear other people’s shoes. And my cousin Ken- my cousin Kendall, from Indiana, he got high once-

Allison mimes shooting Brian behind his back.

BRIAN: -and he started eating really weird foods, and um, and then he just felt like he didn’t belong anywhere, you know, kind of, like, you know, Twilight Zone, kind of.

CLAIRE: Sounds like you.

ANDREW: Look, you guys keep up your talking and Vernon's gonna come right in here. I got a meet this Saturday and I'm not gonna miss it on account of you boneheads.

JOHN: Oh and wouldn't that be a bite, huh? Missing a whole wrestling meet!

ANDREW: Well, you wouldn't know anything about it, faggot! You never competed in your whole life!

JOHN: Oh, I know. I feel all empty inside because of it. I have such a deep admiration for guys that roll around on the floor with other guys.

ANDREW: Ah, you'd never miss it. You don't have any goals.

JOHN: Oh, but I do!

ANDREW: Yeah?

JOHN: I wanna be just like you. I figure all I need's a lobotomy and some tights!

BRIAN: You wear tights?

ANDREW: No, I don't wear tights. I wear the required uniform.

BRIAN: Tights.

ANDREW: Shut up!

Allison smirks and scribbles. Vernon makes a noise in his office and the kids peer around the corner to see him up and walking around. John makes a show of sitting between Claire and Andrew. Vernon ends up going down the hallway away from the detention room. John gets up and heads for the door.

BRIAN: You know, there’s not supposed to be any, uh, monkey business.

JOHN: Young man, have you finished your paper?

John fiddles with latches on the door.

ANDREW: Come on, Bender, don’t screw around.

CLAIRE: What are you gonna do?

ANDREW: Drop dead, I hope.

Cut to Vernon elsewhere in the building. He inspects a reflection of himself and says something incoherent. Cut back to the detention room.

BRIAN: Bender, that’s school property there. I mean, that’s, you know, it doesn’t belong to us and it’s something that’s not to be toyed with.

John closes the door.

ANDREW: That’s very funny. Come on, fix it!

BRIAN: You should really fix that.

John sits back down.

JOHN: Am I a genius?

ANDREW: No, you’re an asshole.

JOHN: What a funny guy.

ANDREW: Fix the door, Bender.

JOHN: Everyone just shh!

Cut in the hallway, Vernon returns and hears the conversation through the door.

JOHN: Listen, I’ve been here before, I know what I’m doing.

ANDREW: No, fix the door! Get up there and fix it!

JOHN: Shut up!

VERNON: Goddamn it!

He bursts in.

VERNON: Why is that door closed?

No one responds.

VENON: Why is that door closed?

JOHN: How are we supposed to know? We’re not supposed to move, right?

Vernon looks at Claire.

VERNON: Why?

CLAIRE: We’re just sitting here, like we’re supposed to.

VERNON: Who closed that door?

JOHN: I think a screw fell out of it.

ANDREW: It just closed, sir.

VERNON: Who?

Allison squeals and slams her face on the table.

JOHN: She doesn’t talk, sir.

VERNON: Give me that screw.

JOHN: I don’t have it.

VERNON: You want me to yank you out of that seat and shake it out of you?

JOHN: I don’t have it. Screws fall out all the time. The world’s an imperfect place.

VERNON: Give it to me, Bender.

CLAIRE: Excuse me, sir, why would anybody want to steal a screw?

VERNON: Watch it, young lady.

Vernon leaves in a huff. He tries to open the door, but it falls shut. He grabs a chair.

JOHN: The door’s way too heavy, sir.

Vernon attempts to prop the door open with the chair, but the door still swings shut, swatting the chair out of the way. He shouts and the kids try to conceal their laughter. Vernon comes back in.

VERNON: Andrew Clark. Get up here. Come on, front and center. Let’s go.

Andrew sighs and gets up.

JOHN: Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?

Vernon instructs Andrew to help him carry a large shelving unit to the door.

JOHN: If he gets up we’ll all get up. It’ll be anarchy!

VERNON: Okay, watch it, watch the magazines.

The carry the unit through the door.

JOHN: It’s out of my hands.

With the door propped open, Andrew clumsily tries to get back inside, but slips. Vernon tries to help him up.

JOHN: That’s very clever, sir. But what if there’s a fire? I think violating fire codes and endangering the lives of children would be unwise at this juncture in your career, sir.

VERNON: Alright, what are you doing with this? What are you doing with this? Get out of here, for god’s sake. What’s the matter with you? Come on.

BRIAN: Well, you know the school comes equipped with fire exits at either end of the library.

JOHN: Show Dick some respect.

Vernon prods Andrew back to the seats.

VERNON: Let’s go. Go, get back in your seat.

Andrew sits down.

VERNON: I expected a little more from a varsity letterman. You’re not fooling anybody, Bender. The next screw that falls out is going to be you.
JOHN: (Muttering) Eat my shorts.

VERNON: What was that?

JOHN: Eat my shorts.

VERNON: You just bought yourself another Saturday, mister.

JOHN: Oh, I’m crushed.

VERNON: You just bought one more right there.

JOHN: Well, I’m free the Saturday after that. Beyond that, I’m going to have to check my calendar.

VERNON: Good, because it’s going to be filled! We’ll keep going. You want another one? Say the word, just say the word. Instead of going to prison you’ll come here. Are you through?

JOHN: No.

VERNON: I’m doing society a favor.

JOHN: So?

VERNON: That’s another one, right now. I’ve got you for the rest of your natural born life if you don’t watch your step. You want another one?

JOHN: Yes.

VERNON: You got it! You got another one right there. That’s another one, pal.

CLAIRE: Cut it out!

She mouths stop at him.

VERNON: You through?

JOHN: Not even close, bud.

VERNON: Good, you got one more right there.

JOHN: You really think I give a shit?

VERNON: Another.

John just stares.

VERNON: You through?

JOHN: How many is that?

BRIAN: That’s seven including when we first came in and you asked Mr. Vernon here whether Barry Manilow knew that he raided his closet.

VERNON: Now it’s eight. You stay out of it.

BRIAN: Excuse me, sir, it’s seven.

VERNON: Shut up, Pee Wee.

Vernon holds up two fingers.

VERNON: You’re mine, Bender. For two months I got you. I got you.

JOHN: What can I say? I’m thrilled.

VERNON: Oh, I’m sure that’s exactly what you want these people to believe. You know something, Bender? You ought to spend a little more time trying to do something with yourself and a little less time trying to impress people. You might be better off. Alright, that’s it. I’m going to be right outside those doors. The next time I have to come in here, I’m cracking skulls.
He walks out, holding two fingers up to John one last time before the door closes. Noise builds up.

JOHN: Fuck you! Fuck.

Cut to a close up of a clock which shows 7:45. John strikes a match on his shoe and uses it to light a cigarette. Claire stares off into the distance. Brian covers his crotch with his hat. Andrew plays with the strings on his hoodie. Allison holds up a string. John hits the fire on his shoe, putting it out. Allison ties the string around her finger, cutting off circulation to the tip. John plays air-guitar. Allison draws a detailed piece of art. Andrew plays paper football. Allison scratches her hair, getting dandruff all over her drawing. The kids all struggle to stay awake. Cut to Vernon staring at them all with contempt.

VERNON: Wake up!

None of the kids respond.

VERNON: Who has to go to the lavatory?

The kids all raise their hands. Cut to the clock again, now a little past 10:20. John sits on a desk ripping something up. Brian stands nearby reading something. Andrew stretches his leg on a railing. Claire sits, looking bored. John throws papers everywhere.

ANDREW: That’s real intelligent.

JOHN: You’re right. It’s wrong to destroy literature. It’s such fun to read. And…

He reads the name of the author off of the book he’s ripping up.

JOHN: “Mollay” really pumps my nads.

Claire smiles at John.

CLAIRE: Molière.

Classical music plays.

BRIAN: I love his work.


John angrily throws paper at Brian and puts the book down.

JOHN: Big deal. Nothing to do when you’re locked in a vacancy.

He picks up a drawer of index cards.

ANDREW: Ah, speak for yourself.

JOHN: Do you think I’d speak for you? I don’t even know your language.

Andrew turns away from John to Claire.

ANDREW: Hey, you grounded tonight?

CLAIRE: I don’t know. My mom said I was, but my dad told me just to blow her off.

Andrew gives a pointed look to John before continuing.

ANDREW: There’s a big party at Stubby’s. Parents are in Europe. Should be pretty wild.

CLAIRE: Yeah?

ANDREW: Yeah, you gonna go?

CLAIRE: I doubt it.

ANDREW: How come?

CLAIRE: Well, cause if I do what my mother tells me not to do, it’s because my father says it’s okay. It’s this whole big monster deal. It’s endless. It’s a total drag. It’s like any minute, divorce.

JOHN: Who do you like better?

CLAIRE: What?

JOHN: You like your old man better than your mom?

CLAIRE: They’re both screwed.

JOHN: No, I mean, if you had to choose between them.

CLAIRE: I don’t know. Probably go live with my brother. I mean, I don’t think either one of them gives a shit about me. It’s like they use me just to get back at each other.

ALLISON: Ha!

Claire, John, and Brian look at Allison in confusion. Andrew smiles. Allison blows hair out of her own face.

CLAIRE: Shut up.

ANDREW: You’re just feeling sorry for yourself.

CLAIRE: Yeah, well, if I didn’t, nobody else would.

ANDREW: Aw, you’re breaking my heart.

JOHN: Sporto?

ANDREW: What?

John hops down from the desk.

JOHN: You get along with your parents?

ANDREW: Well, if I say yes I’m an idiot, right?

John hops over the railing in front of Andrew.

JOHN: You’re an idiot anyway. But if you say you get along with your parents, well you’re a liar too.

John walks away. Andrew follows and shoves him from behind.

ANDREW: You know something, man? If we weren’t in school right now I’d waste you.

John holds up his hand.

JOHN: Can you hear this? You want me to turn it up?

He turns his hand up, flipping off Andrew. Brian walks into frame and tries to get between them.

BRIAN: Hey, fellas, I mean-

He reaches his arms around them, but they both shove him off. Andrew takes a few steps away.

BRIAN: I don’t, I don’t like my parents either, I mean, I don’t, you know, I don’t, I don’t get along with them, and their idea of, you know, parental compassion is just, you know, whacko, you know?

JOHN: Dork?

BRIAN: Yeah?

JOHN: You are a parent’s wet dream, okay?

He pats Brian, who stumbles back onto a desk.

BRIAN: Well, that’s the problem.

JOHN: Look, I can see you getting all bunged up for them making you wear these kind of clothes, but face it. You’re a neo-maxi-zoon-dweebie. What would you be doing if you weren’t out making yourself a better citizen?

ANDREW: Why do you have to insult everybody?

JOHN: I’m being honest, asshole. I would expect you to know the difference.

ANDREW: Yeah, well he’s got a name.

JOHN: Yeah?

ANDREW: Yeah. What’s your name?

BRIAN: Brian.

ANDREW: See?

JOHN: My condolences.

CLAIRE: What's your name?

JOHN: What's yours?

CLAIRE: Claire.

JOHN: Claire?

CLAIRE: Claire. It's a family name.

JOHN: No, it's a fat girl's name.

CLAIRE: Oh, thank you.

JOHN: You're welcome.

CLAIRE: I'm not fat.

JOHN: Well, not at present, but I could see you really pushing maximum density. You see, I'm not sure if you know this, but there are two kinds of fat people. There's fat people that were born to be fat, and there's fat people that were once thin, but they became fat, so when you look at them you can sort of see that thin person inside. You see, you're gonna get married, you're gonna squeeze out a few puppies and then, uh…

He imitates bloating up. She flips him off.

JOHN: Oh, obscene finger gestures from such a pristine girl.

CLAIRE: I'm not that pristine.

He leans in closer.

JOHN: Are you a virgin? I'll bet you a million dollars that you are. Let's end the suspense. Is it gonna be a...white weddin'?

CLAIRE: Why don't you just shut up?

JOHN: Have you ever kissed a boy on the mouth? Have you ever been felt up, over the bra, under the blouse, shoes off, hoping to God your parents don't walk in?

CLAIRE: Do you want me to puke?

JOHN: Over the panties, no bra, blouse unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on the front seat past 11:00 on a school night?

ANDREW: Leave her alone.

John doesn’t move. Andrew walks closer.

ANDREW: I said, leave her alone.

JOHN: You gonna make me?

ANDREW: Yeah.

John walks closer.

JOHN: You and how many of your friends?

ANDREW: Just me. Just you and me. Two hits. Me hitting you, you hitting the floor. Anytime you're ready, pal.

John shoves Andrew. Andrew grabs John’s arm and pins him to the ground.

JOHN: I don't want to get into this with you, man.

Andrew gets off of him.

ANDREW: Why not?

JOHN: Because I'd kill you. It's real simple: I'd kill you, and your fucking parents would sue me, and it'd be a big mess, and I don't care enough about you to bother.

He backs up as he talks.

ANDREW: Chickenshit.

Andrew turns away, but looks back when he hears John pull out a switchblade. John stabs it into a chair.

ANDREW: Let's end this right now. You don't talk to her-

Allison takes John’s knife.

ANDREW: -you don't look at her, and you don't even think about her! You understand me?

JOHN: I'm trying to help her.

Cut to Carl the janitor entering. He empties a trash near the kids.

CARL: Hey, Brian, how you doing?

JOHN: Your dad work here?

Andrew smirks.

JOHN: Uh, Carl?

CARL: What?

JOHN: Can I ask you a question?

CARL: Sure.

JOHN: How does one become a janitor?

CARL: You want to be a janitor?

JOHN: No, I just want to know how one becomes a janitor, because Andrew here is very interested in pursuing a career in the custodial arts.

CARL: Oh, really? You guys think I'm just some untouchable peasant? Serf? Peon? Huh? Maybe so. But following a broom around after shitheads like you for the last eight years, I've learned a couple of things. I look through your letters. I look through your lockers. I listen to your conversations: you don't know that but I do. I am the eyes and ears of this institution, my friends.

He turns to leave and checks his watch.

CARL: By the way, that clock's 20 minutes fast.

John smiles as Carl leaves. Cut to Vernon in his office. He sees the clock reach 11:30 and gets up. In the detention room, John whistles with a bandana on his head. The rest of the kids join in. They stop when Vernon enters. John switches to a different tune.

VERNON: Alright, girls. That’s thirty minutes for lunch.

ANDREW: Here?

VERNON: Here.

ANDREW: Well, I think the cafeteria would be a more suitable place for us to eat lunch in, sir.

VERNON: Well, I don’t care what you think, Andrew.

JOHN: Uh, Dick- excuse me, Rich. Will milk be made available to us?

ANDREW: We’re extremely thirsty, sir.

CLAIRE: I have a really low tolerance for dehydration.

ANDREW: I’ve seen her dehydrate, sir. It’s pretty gross.

JOHN: Relax, I’ll get it.

John begins to get up.

VERNON: Ah, ah, ah. Grab some wood there, bub. What, do you think I was born yesterday? You think I’m going to have you roaming these halls? You.

He looks at Andrew. Andrew gestures to Claire.

VERNON: And you.

Vernon points to Allison. She doesn’t notice.

VERNON: Hey! What’s her name? Wake her, wake her up. Hey, come on, on your feet, missy. Let’s go. This is no rest home.

Allison grabs her bag and gets up.

VERNON: There’s a soft drink machine in the teacher’s lounge. Let’s go.

Andrew gets up. Cut to Andrew and Allison walking down the halls. Allison keeps a distance a few steps behind him.

ANDREW: So, what’s your poison? What do you drink?

She says nothing.

ANDREW: Okay, forget I asked.

They walk in silence for a moment.

ALLISON: Vodka.

ANDREW: Vodka. When do you drink vodka?

ALLISON: Whenever.

She moves up a step ahead of him.

ANDREW: A lot?

ALLISON: Tons.

ANDREW: Is that why you’re here today? Why are you here?

ALLISON: Why are you here?

He takes a moment and backs up.

ANDREW: Um… I’m here today because, uh… Because my coach and my father don’t want me to blow my ride. See, I get treated differently because, uh, coach thinks I’m a winner. So does my old man. I’m not a winner because I want to be one. I’m a winner because I got strength and speed, kind of like a racehorse. That’s about how involved I am in what’s happening to me.

ALLISON: Yeah. That’s very interesting. Now, why don’t you tell me why you’re really in here.

ANDREW: Forget it.

Back in the detention room, John is watching Claire. She rotates around a statue in the middle of the room. Brian is sitting near John, also watching her.

JOHN: Claire? You want to see a picture of a guy with elephantitis of the nuts? It’s pretty tasty.

CLAIRE: No, thank you.

JOHN: How do you think he rides a bike?

She just glares at him.

JOHN: Oh, Claire, would you ever consider dating a guy like this?

CLAIRE: Can’t you just leave me alone?

JOHN: I mean, if he had a great personality and was a good dancer and had a cool car. Although, you’d probably have to ride in the backseat because his nuts would ride shotgun.

CLAIRE: You know what I wish I was doing?

JOHN: Watch what you say. Brian here is a cherry.

BRIAN: A cherry?

CLAIRE: I wish I was in a plane to France.

BRIAN: I’m not a cherry.

JOHN: When have you ever gotten laid?

BRIAN: I’ve laid lots of times.

JOHN: Name one.

BRIAN: She lives in Canada. Met her at Niagara Falls. You wouldn’t know her.

JOHN: Ever laid anyone around here?

Brian gestures to Claire.

JOHN: Oh, you and Claire did it.

CLAIRE: What are you talking about?

BRIAN: Nothing, nothing. Let’s just drop it, okay? We’ll talk about it later.

CLAIRE: No, drop what? What are you talking about?

JOHN: Well, Brian’s trying to tell me that in addition to the number of girls in the Niagara Falls area, that presently you and he are riding the hobby horse.

CLAIRE: You little pig.

BRIAN: No, I’m not. I’m n- John said I was a cherry and I said I wasn’t. That’s it. That’s all that was said.

JOHN: Well, then what were you motioning to Claire for?

CLAIRE: You know, I don’t appreciate this very much, Brian.

BRIAN: He is lying.

JOHN: Oh, you weren’t motioning to Claire?

BRIAN: You know he’s lying, right?

JOHN: Were you or were you not motioning to Claire?

BRIAN: Yeah, but it was only because I didn’t want her to know I was a virgin, okay? Excuse me for being a virgin, I’m sorry.

CLAIRE: Why didn’t you want me to know you were a virgin?

BRIAN: Because it’s personal business. It’s my personal private business.

JOHN: Well, Brian, it doesn’t sound like you’re doing any business.

CLAIRE: I think it’s okay for a guy to be a virgin.

BRIAN: You do?

Cut to Claire, John, and Andrew sitting at a table. Some drinks are spread out on the table. Claire and Andrew are opening bags of food.

JOHN: What’s in there?

CLAIRE: Guess. Where’s your lunch?

JOHN: You’re wearing it.

CLAIRE: You’re nauseating.

John grabs a drink and tosses it to Allison, who’s looking at an album. Claire takes out her lunch.

JOHN: What’s that?

CLAIRE: Sushi.

JOHN: Sushi?

CLAIRE: Rice, raw fish, and seaweed.

JOHN: You won’t accept a guy’s tongue in your mouth and you’re gonna eat that?

CLAIRE: Can I eat?

JOHN: I don’t know. Give it a try.

Andrew takes out his lunch, which has substantially more food than anyone else’s. Allison opens her drink which fizzes over, and she slurps up what spills. Brian looks at her. Andrew notices Claire and John staring at him.

ANDREW: What’s your problem?

Allison takes apart her sandwich, tossing the meat at the statue in the middle of the room. She pours a large amount of sugar all over her food and begins mashing it all up as the others stare. She notices them as she takes a bite. John moves over to Brian and takes his food.

JOHN: What are we having?

BRIAN: Uh, just your standard regular lunch, I guess.

John reaches in and pulls out a thermos.

JOHN: Milk?

BRIAN: Soup.

John reaches in the bag again. Brian reaches over, but John slaps his hand away. He pulls out a juice box.

BRIAN: That’s apple juice.

JOHN: I can read. PB&J with the crusts cut off. Well, Brian, this is a very nutritious lunch. All the food groups are represented. Did your mom marry Mr. Rogers?

BRIAN: Uh, no. Mr. Johnson.

JOHN: Ah. Here's my impression of life at Big Bri's house.

He gets up and begins acting out a scene.

JOHN: ""Son?"" ""Yeah, Dad?"" ""How was your day, pal?"" ""Great, Dad! How's yours?"" ""Super! Say, son, how’d you like to go fishing this weekend?"" ""Great, Dad! But I got homework to do."" ""That's okay, son! You can do it on the boat!"" ""Gee!"" ""Dear, isn't our son swell?"" ""Yes, dear. Isn't life swell?""

He mimes Brian’s parents kissing each other, then punching one of them. Andrew sees Brian’s face fall.

ANDREW: All right, what about your family?

JOHN: What, mine?

ANDREW: Yeah.

JOHN: It’s real easy.

He gets up and acts out another scene.

JOHN: ""Stupid, worthless, no good, goddamned, free loading son-of-a-bitch! Retarded, big mouth, know-it-all asshole jerk!"" ""You forgot ugly, lazy, and disrespectful!"" ""Shut up, bitch! Go fix me a turkey pot pie!"" ""What about you, Dad?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?"" ""Fuck you!"" ""No, Dad, what about you?!"" ""Fuck you!""

He mimes getting punched by his dad.

BRIAN: Is that for real?

JOHN: You wanna come over some time?

ANDREW: That's bullshit. It's all part of your image; I don't believe a word of it.

JOHN: You don't believe me?

ANDREW: No.

JOHN: No?

ANDREW: Did I stutter?

John walks over to Andrew. He pulls up his sleeve and shows Andrew a burn mark on his arm.

JOHN: Believe this? Huh? It's about the size of a cigar. Do I stutter? You see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage. See, I don't think that I need to sit with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

He walks away, swiping some books off of a desk in anger. He climbs up some stairs and takes a moment to breathe.

CLAIRE: You shouldn’t have said that.

ANDREW: How did I know? I mean, he lies about everything anyway.

Cut to Vernon eating lunch in his office. He spills his drink all over his desk.

VERNON: Oh, shit.

He walks out of his office.

VERNON: Coffee. Probably scrape it off the bottom of the Mississippi River. Everything’s polluted. The coffee’s polluted.

As Vernon rounds a corner, the kids exit the detention room. He enters the bathroom while the kids walk the halls.

CLAIRE: How do you know where Vernon went?

JOHN: I don’t.

CLAIRE: Well, then how do you know when he’ll be back?

JOHN: I don’t. Being bad feels pretty good, huh?

BRIAN: What’s the point of going to Bender’s locker?

ANDREW: Beats me.

BRIAN: This is so stupid. Why do you think, why are we risking getting caught?

ANDREW: I don’t know.

BRIAN: So then, what are we doing?

ANDREW: You ask me one more question and I’m beating the shit out of you.

BRIAN: Sorry.

Cut to John’s locker. He opens it.

ANDREW: You’re such a slob.

JOHN: My maid’s on vacation.

He takes out a bag. He pulls another bag out of it, and then a third bag out of the second. Finally, he pulls a bag of weed out. Brian sniffs.

BRIAN: Drugs.

ANDREW: Screw that, Bender. Put it back.

BRIAN: Drugs. The boy has marijuana.

John walks away, then Claire.

BRIAN: That was marijuana.

ANDREW: Shut up, dick.

Andrew follows.

BRIAN: Do you approve of this?

Allison doesn’t respond. Brian turns and follows the others. Allison steals the lock off of John’s locker. Cut to John and Andrew walking in unison.

JOHN: We’ll cross through the lab, and then we’ll double back.

ANDREW: You better be right. If Vernon cuts us off, it’s your fault, asshole.

BRIAN: What’d he say? Where are we going?

As the kids come around a corner, they see Vernon heading back to the detention room. They scramble around various hallways as music plays, often being barely missed by Vernon.

JOHN: Wait, wait, hold it, hold it. We have to go through the cafeteria.

ANDREW: No, the activities hall.

JOHN: Hey, man, you don’t know what you’re talking about.

ANDREW: No, you don’t know what you’re talking about! Now, we’re through listening to you. We’re going this way. You go where you want, mother hen.

Andrew runs off. Brian and Claire follow. Allison looks at John for a moment before they both follow the others. Vernon walks slowly to where the kids just were. They kids find themselves blocked by a gate.

ANDREW: Shit.

JOHN: Great idea, jagoff.

ANDREW: Fuck you!

CLAIRE: Fuck you! Why didn’t you listen to John?

BRIAN: We’re dead.

JOHN: No, just me.

BRIAN: What do you mean?

JOHN: Get back to the library.

He shoves the weed in Brian’s pants.

JOHN: Keep your unit out of it.

John runs down the hallway, yelling.

JOHN: I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!

Elsewhere, Vernon hears John in the distance.

VERNON: That son of a bitch!

Vernon runs off. We see shots of each of them running through hallways.

JOHN: Before the day I die, there’s some things I want to buy! Light bulbs, light bulbs, automobile, and a Ferris wheel! I want to be an air force ranger! I want to lead a life of danger!

Vernon turns a corner, out of breath. He hears a sound in the distance. Cut to John in the gymnasium, playing with a basketball.

JOHN: Ah! Three, two, one!

He makes a slam dunk. Vernon walks in.

JOHN: Big applause!

VERNON: Bender! What is this? What are you doing here? What is this?

JOHN: Hi.

John dribbles.

VERNON: Out! That’s it, Bender. Out, it’s over.

JOHN: Don’t you want to hear my excuse?

VERNON: Out!

JOHN: I’m thinking of trying out for a scholarship.

VERNON: Give me the ball, Bender. Give me that ball.

John does two fake outs before rolling the ball over gently. Vernon kicks it at him. They both exit the gymnasium. Cut back to the detention room.

VERNON: Get your stuff, let’s go.

Vernon shoves John towards the tables.

VERNON: Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon himself to go to the gymnasium. I’m sorry to inform you you’re going to be without his services for the rest of the day.

JOHN: B-O-O-H-O-O.

VERNON: Everything’s a big joke, huh, Bender? The false alarm you pulled Friday, false alarms are really funny, aren’t they? What if your home, what if your family… What if your dope was on fire?

JOHN: Impossible, sir. It’s in Johnson’s underwear.

Andrew chuckles.

VERNON: Oh, you think he’s funny? You think this is cute? You think he’s bitchin’? Is that it? Let me tell you something. Look at him. He’s a bum. You wanna see something funny? You go visit John Bender in five years, you’ll see how goddamn funny he is.

Vernon walks over to John.

VERNON: What’s the matter, John? You gonna cry? Let’s go.

Vernon grabs John’s arm. John gets up and shakes him off.

JOHN: Hey, keep your fucking hands off me! I expect better manners from you, Dick.

John walks away. He sets sunglasses down in front of Andrew.

JOHN: For better hallway vision.

John knocks things off of a desk as he leaves, followed by Vernon. Cut to the two of them in a closet.

VERNON: That’s the last time, Bender. That’s the last time you ever make me look bad in front of those kids, do you hear me? I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year and I’ve got a home, and I’m not about to throw it away on some punk like you. But someday, man, someday when you’re out of here and you’ve forgotten all about this place, and they’ve forgotten all about you, and you’re wrapped up in your own pathetic life, I’m gonna be there. That’s right. And I’m gonna kick the living shit out of you, man. I’m going to knock your dick in the dirt.

JOHN: You threatening me?

VERNON: What’re you gonna do about it? You think anybody’s gonna believe you? You think anybody is gonna take your word over mine? I’m a man of respect around here. They love me around here. I’m a swell guy. You’re a lying sack of shit and everybody knows it. Oh, you’re a tough guy. Hey, hey, come on, come on. Get on your feet, pal. Let’s find out how tough you are. I wanna know right now how tough you are. Come on, I’ll give you the first punch. Let’s go, come on. Right here. Just take the first shot. Please, I’m begging you. Take a shot right here, come on. Just take one shot. That’s all I need. Just one swing.

John doesn’t do anything. Vernon backs off. He goes for a fake out and John flinches.

VERNON: That’s what I thought. You’re a gutless turd.

Vernon exits, locking the door on his way out. Cut to him entering the bathroom, then back to the closet. The camera pans up a stack of objects and then to a roof tile sliding into place. Cut to John making his way above the ceiling, crawling on all fours.

JOHN: A naked blonde walks into a bar with a poodle under one arm and a two-foot salami under the other. She lays the poodle on the table. Bartender says, ""I suppose you won't be needing a drink."" Naked lady says- Oh, shit!

He falls through the ceiling into the detention room.

VERNON: Jesus Christ Almighty!

The other kids look on in shock as John falls and then makes his way down the stairs to the main table area.

JOHN: Forgot my pencil.

He walks over to his seat.

VERNON: Goddamn it!

Vernon enters. John is nowhere to be seen.

VERNON: What in god's name is goin' on in here? What was that ruckus?

The kids just shrug.

ANDREW: Uh, what ruckus?

VERNON: I was just in my office and I heard a ruckus.

BRIAN: Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

VERNON: Watch your tongue, young man, watch it.

Under the table in front of Claire, John hits his head. Andrew hits along in a rhythm.

VERNON: What is this?

Andrew makes a zipper sound.

VERNON: What is that? What, what is that, what is that noise?

Under the table, John stares at Claire’s panties.

ANDREW: What noise?

CLAIRE: Really, sir, there wasn't any noise.

As John moves closer, she crushes his head between her knees. He cries out. Claire pretends to sneeze to cover. The other students cough along.

CLAIRE: That noise? Was that the noise that you're talking about?

VERNON: No, it wasn't. That was not the noise I was talking about. Now, I may not have caught you in the act this time, but you can bet I will.

Allison laughs.

VERNON: You make book on that, Missy. And you!

He points to Claire.

VERNON: I will not be made a fool of.

Vernon walks away. Toilet paper liner is stuck to the back of his pants. As the door slams shut, Andrew, Brian, and Allison crack up. Claire kicks John and scoots her chair back. She keeps hitting him as he gets out from under the table

JOHN: It was an accident.

CLAIRE: You’re an asshole.

JOHN: Sue me.

He walks over to Brian.

JOHN: So, Ahab, can I have all my doobage?

Brian pulls out the weed and hands it to John.

ANDREW: Yo, wasteoid. You’re not going to blaze up in here.

John ignores him. Claire looks at Andrew, who shakes his head. She gets up and follows John anyway. Brian awkwardly clears his throat. He mouths a question and Andrew, who shakes his head. Biran looks around for a moment and then walks to the back. Andrew turns away and looks agitated.

ANDREW: Shit.

He grabs his sunglasses and gets up. Allison watches. Cut to Vernon, who enters the basement. Cut back to the detention room. Brian is wearing the sunglasses. He, John, and Claire giggle. John lights a match with his teeth and lights the blunt in Claire’s mouth. She coughs. John laughs. Brian pretends to eat the smoke from his blunt. Brian begins doing an impression.

BRIAN: Chicks cannot hold their smoke. That’s what it is.

John chuckles

CLAIRE: Do you know how popular I am? I’m so popular, everybody loves me so much at this school.

BRIAN: Poor baby.

Allison stares slack-jawed at the others from her table.

BRIAN: Five.

He holds up his hand. John gives him a forceful high-five, pushing him backwards. His legs go up in the air. Claire laughs. Andrew exits a nearby smoke-filled room smoking a blunt. He takes off his jacket and starts dancing around.

ANDREW: Woo!

He does a cart-wheel as he goes, then a barrel-roll. He takes off his shirt and swings it around, throwing it down. Brian whistles. Andrew pretends to hit himself and then keeps running around the perimeter of the second floor. Brian, laughing, hits Claire, who yelps. Andrew makes his way back to the smoke-filled room and walks in closing the door. He yells, and the glass on the door’s window shatters. Cut to Vernon, who’s reading files.

VERNON: Mr… Oh, Mr. Tierney. A history of slight mental illness.

Carl walks in.

VERNON: No wonder he’s so fucked up.

CARL: Afternoon, Dick.

Vernon looks up and puts the file he’s reading down.

VERNON: Hey, Carl, how you doing?

CARL: Good.

VERNON: Good, what’s up?

CARL: Not much. What’s happening? What are you doing in the basement files?

VERNON: Oh, nothing, nothing here. I’m just doing a little homework here.

CARL: Homework, huh?

Carl walks closer.

VERNON: Yeah.

CARL: Confidential files, huh?

VERNON: Well, look, Carl, this is a highly sensitive area, and I, I tell you something, certain people would be very, very embarrassed. I would really appreciate it if this would be something that you and I could keep between us.

CARL: What are you gonna do for me, man?

VERNON: What would you like?

CARL: You got fifty bucks?

VERNON: What?

CARL: Fifty bucks.

Cut back to the detention room. Brian and Andrew are sitting in chairs and laughing.

ANDREW: No, no, man, no. You got a middle name?

BRIAN: Yeah, guess.

ANDREW: Uh-

Allison begins walking over.

ALLISON: Your middle name is Ralph, as in, puke. Your birth date’s March 12th, you’re five-nine and a half, you weigh 130 pounds and your social security number is 049-38-0913.

She sits near Brian.

ANDREW: Wow, are you psychic?

ALLISON: No.

BRIAN: Well, would you mind telling me how you know all this about me?

She pulls out a wallet from her bag.

ALLISON: I stole your wallet.

BRIAN: Give it to me.

ALLISON: No.

BRIAN: Give it.

She tosses it down.

BRIAN: This is great, you’re a thief too, huh?

ALLISON: I’m not a thief.

ANDREW: Multi-talented.

ALLISON: What’s there to steal? Two bucks and a beaver shot.

ANDREW: A what?

ALLISON: He’s got a nudie picture in there. I saw it. It’s perverted.

ANDREW: Alright, let’s see it.

John brushes his teeth. Claire reads a clip of IDs.

CLAIRE: Are all these your girlfriends?

JOHN: Some of them.

CLAIRE: What about the others?

JOHN: Well, some I consider my girlfriends and some I just consider.

CLAIRE: Consider what?

JOHN: Whether or not I want to hang out with them.

CLAIRE: You don’t believe in just one guy, one girl?

JOHN: Do you?

CLAIRE: Yeah. That’s the way it should be.

JOHN: Not for me.

CLAIRE: Why not?

JOHN: How come you got so much shit in your purse?

CLAIRE: How come you have so many girlfriends?

JOHN: I asked you first.

CLAIRE: I don’t know. I guess I never throw anything away.

JOHN: Neither do I.

CLAIRE: Oh.

ANDREW: This is the worst fake ID I’ve ever seen. You realize you made yourself 68?

BRIAN: Oh, I know, I know, I goofed it.

ANDREW: What do you need a fake ID for?

BRIAN: So I can vote.

ALLISON: Want to see what’s in my bag?

ANDREW AND BRIAN: No.

She looks at them, then spills the contents of her bag all over the couch.

ANDREW: Holy shit. What is all that stuff?

BRIAN: Do you always carry this much shit in your bag?

ALLISON: Yeah. I always carry this much shit in my bag. You never know when you may have to jam.

BRIAN: Are you going to be like, a shopping bag lady? You know, like, sit in alleyways, and, like, talk to buildings and wear men’s shoes and that kind of thing?

ALLISON: I’ll do what I have to do.

BRIAN: Why do you have to do anything?

ALLISON: My home life is unsatisfying.

BRIAN: So you’re saying you’d subject yourself to the violent dangers of these Chicago streets because your home life is unsatisfying?

ALLISON: I don’t have to run away and live in the street. I can run away and I can go to the ocean. I can go to the country. I can go to the mountains. I can go to Israel, Africa, Afghanistan.

Brian leans over to Andrew.

BRIAN: Andy, you want to get in on this? Allison here says she wants to run away because her home life is unsatisfying.

ANDREW: Well, everyone’s home life is unsatisfying. And if it wasn’t, people would live with their parents forever.

BRIAN: Yeah, yeah. I understand, but I think hers goes beyond what, you know, guys like you and me consider normal unsatisfying.

ALLISON: Never mind, forget it, everything’s cool.

She begins packing stuff back in her bag.

ANDREW: What’s the deal?

ALLISON: No. There’s no deal, sporto. Forget it. Leave me alone.

ANDREW: Wait a minute. Now, you’re carrying all that crap around in your purse. Either you really want to run away or you want people to think you want to run away.

ALLISON: Eat shit.

She walks off.

BRIAN: The girl is an island with herself.

Andrew throws Brian’s wallet back at Brian and walks off towards Allison.

ANDREW: Hi. You want to talk?

ALLISON: No.

ANDREW: Why not?

ALLISON: Go away.

ANDREW: Where do you want me to go?

ALLISON: Go away!

After a few moments, he walks away.

ALLISON: You have problems.

ANDREW: Oh, I have problems?

ALLISON: You do everything everybody ever tells you to do! That is a problem.

ANDREW: Okay, fine. But I didn’t dump my purse out on the couch and invite people into my problems, did I?

He walks closer to her.

ANDREW: So what’s wrong? What is it? Is it bad? Real bad? Parents?

ALLISON: Yeah.

ANDREW: What did they do to you?

ALLISON: They ignore me.

ANDREW: Yeah. Yeah.

Cut to Vernon and Carl.

VERNON: What did you want to be when you were young?

CARL: When I was a kid I wanted to be John Lennon.

VERNON: Carl, don’t be a goof. I’m trying to make a serious point here. Carl, I’ve been teaching for twenty two years, and each year these kids get more and more arrogant.

CARL: Oh, bullshit, man. Come on, Vern. The kids haven’t changed, you have. You took a teaching position because you thought it’d be fun, right? Thought you could have summer vacations off? And then you found out it was actually work. That really bummed you out.

Vernon shakes his head.

VERNON: These kids turned on me. They think I’m a big fucking joke.

CARL: Come on. Listen, Vern, if you were sixteen, what would you think of you?

VERNON: Hey, Carl, you think I give one rat’s ass what these kids think of me?

CARL: Yes, I do.

VERNON: You think about this. When you get old, these kids, when I get old, they’re gonna be running the country.

CARL: Yeah.

VERNON: Now, this is the thought that wakes me up in the middle of the night, that when I get older, these kids are gonna take care of me.

CARL: I wouldn't count on it.

Back in the detention room, all five kids are seated on the floor.

ANDREW: What would I do for a million bucks? I guess I’d do as little as I had to.

CLAIRE: That’s boring.

ANDREW: Well, how am I supposed to answer?

CLAIRE: The idea is to, like, search your mind for the absolute limit. Like, um… Would you drive to school naked?

He laughs.

ANDREW: Uh, would I have to get out of the car?

CLAIRE: Of course.

ANDREW: In the spring? Or winter?

CLAIRE: Doesn’t matter. Spring.

ANDREW: In front of the school or in back of the school?

CLAIRE: Either one.

ANDREW: Yes.

ALLISON: I’d do that. I’ll do anything sexual. I don’t need a million dollars to do it, either.

CLAIRE: You’re lying.

ALLISON: I already have. I’ve done just about everything there is except a few things that are illegal. I’m a nymphomaniac.

CLAIRE: Lie.

BRIAN: Are your parents aware of this?

ALLISON: The only person I told was my shrink.

ANDREW: What did he do when you told him?

ALLISON: He nailed me.

CLAIRE: Very nice.

ALLISON: I don’t think that from a legal standpoint what he did can be construed as rape since I paid him.

CLAIRE: He’s an adult.

ALLISON: Yeah, he’s married, too.

CLAIRE: Ugh. Do you have any idea how completely gross that is?

ALLISON: Well, the first few times-

CLAIRE: The first few times? You mean he did it more than once?

ALLISON: Sure.

CLAIRE: Are you crazy?

BRIAN: Obviously she’s crazy if she’s screwing a shrink.

ALLISON: Have you ever done it?

CLAIRE: I don’t even have a psychiatrist.

ALLISON: Have you ever done it with a normal person?

CLAIRE: Didn't we already cover this?

JOHN: You never answered the question.

CLAIRE: Look, I'm not going to discuss my private life with total strangers.

ALLISON: It's kind of a double edged sword, isn't it?

CLAIRE: A what?

ALLISON: Well, if you say you haven't, you're a prude. If you say you have, you're a slut. It's a trap. You want to but you can't, and when you do, you wish you didn't, right?

CLAIRE: Wrong.

ALLISON: Or are you a tease?

ANDREW: She's a tease.

CLAIRE: I'm sure. Why don't you just forget it.

ANDREW: Oh, you're a tease and you know it. All girls are teases.

JOHN: She's only a tease if what she does gets you hot.

CLAIRE: I don't do anything.

ALLISON: That's why you're a tease.

CLAIRE: Okay, let me ask you a few questions.

ALLISON: I already told you everything.

CLAIRE: No. Doesn't it bother you to sleep around without being in love? I mean, don't you want any respect?

ALLISON: I don't screw to get respect. That's the difference between you and me.

CLAIRE: It's not the only difference I hope.

JOHN: Face it, you're a tease.

CLAIRE: I'm not a tease.

JOHN: Sure you are. Sex is your weapon. You said it yourself. You use it to get respect.

CLAIRE: No, I never said that. She twisted my words around.

JOHN: What do you use it for then?

CLAIRE: I don't use it period.

JOHN: Oh, are you medically frigid or is it psychological?

CLAIRE: I didn't mean it that way. You guys are putting words into my mouth.

JOHN: Well, if you'd just answer the question.

BRIAN: Why don't you just answer the question?

ANDREW: Be honest.

JOHN: No big deal.

BRIAN: Yeah answer it.

ANDREW: Answer the question, Claire.

JOHN: Talk to us.

They all begin talking over each other, prodding her to answer the question.

JOHN: C'mon, it's easy. It's only one question.

CLAIRE: No, I never did it!

ALLISON: I never did it either. I'm not a nymphomaniac, I'm a compulsive liar.

CLAIRE: You are such a bitch. You did that on purpose just to fuck me over.

ALLISON: I would do it, though. If you love someone, it’s okay.

CLAIRE: I can’t believe you. You’re so weird. You don’t say anything all day and then when you open your mouth you unload all these tremendous lies all over me.

ANDREW: You’re just pissed off because she got you to admit something you didn’t want to admit to.

CLAIRE: Okay, fine. But that doesn’t make it any less bizarre.

ANDREW: What's bizarre? I mean, we're all pretty bizarre! Some of us are just better at hiding it, that's all.

CLAIRE: How are you bizarre?

ALLISON: He can't think for himself.

ANDREW: She's right. Do you guys know what uh, what I did to get in here?

Claire shakes her head.

ANDREW: I taped Larry Lester's buns together.

BRIAN: That was you?

ANDREW: Yeah, you know him?

BRIAN: Yeah, I know him.

ANDREW: Well then, you know how hairy he is right? Well, when they pulled the tape off, most of his hair came off and some, some skin too.

CLAIRE: Oh, my god.

ANDREW: And the bizarre thing is, is that I did it for my old man. I tortured this poor kid, because I wanted him to think that I was cool. He's always going off about, you know, when he was in school, all the wild things he used to do. And I got the feeling that he was disappointed that I never cut loose on anyone, right? So, I'm, I'm sitting in the locker room, and I'm taping up my knee, and Larry's undressing a couple lockers down from me. And he's kinda, he's kinda skinny, weak. And I started thinking about my father, and his attitude about weakness. And the next thing I knew, I, uh, I jumped on top of him and started wailing on him. And my friends, they just laughed and cheered me on. And, afterwards, when I was sitting in Vernon's office, all I could think about was Larry's father. And Larry havin' to go home and, and explain what happened to him. And the humiliation, fucking humiliation he must've felt. It must've been unreal. I mean, I mean, how do you apologize for something like that? There's no way. It's all because of me and my old man. God, I fucking hate him! He's like this, he's like this mindless machine that I can't even relate to anymore. ""Andrew, you've got to be number one! I won't tolerate any losers in this family. Your intensity is for shit! Win! Win! Win!"" You son of a bitch. You know, sometimes, I wish my knee would give, and I wouldn't be able to wrestle anymore. And he could forget all about me.

JOHN: I think your old man and my old man should get together and go bowling.

BRIAN: It's like me, you know, with my grades. Like, when I, when I step outside myself kinda, and when I, when I look in at myself you know? And I see me. I don't like what I see. I really don't.

CLAIRE: What's wrong with you? Why don't you like yourself?

BRIAN: Sounds stupid, but… ‘Cause I'm failing shop. See, we had this assignment, to make this ceramic elephant, and um, and we had eight weeks to do it and we're supposed to, and it was like a lamp, and when you pull the trunk, the light was supposed to go on. My light didn't go on. I got an F on it. Never got an F in my life. When I signed up, you know, for the course, I mean, I thought I was playing it real smart, you know. 'Cause I thought, ""I'll take shop, it'll be such an easy way to maintain my grade point average.""

JOHN: Why'd you think it'd be easy?

BRIAN: Have you seen some of the dopes that take shop?

JOHN: I take shop. You must be a fuckin' idiot.

BRIAN: I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't make a lamp?

JOHN: No, you're a genius because you can't make a lamp.

BRIAN: What do you know about Trigonometry?

JOHN: I could care less about Trigonometry.

BRIAN: Bender, did you know without Trigonometry, there'd be no engineering?

JOHN: Without lamps, there'd be no light.

CLAIRE: Okay, so neither one of you is any better than the other one.

ALLISON: I can write with my toes. I can also eat, brush my teeth.

CLAIRE: With your feet?

ALLISON: Play Heart and Soul on the piano.

BRIAN: I can make spaghetti.

CLAIRE: What can you do?

ANDREW: I can tape all of your buns together.

JOHN: I want to see what Claire can do.

CLAIRE: I can’t do anything.

JOHN: No, everybody can do something.

CLAIRE: There’s one thing I can do… No, forget it. It’s way too embarrassing.

JOHN: You ever see “Wild Kingdom?” I mean, that guy’s been doing that show for thirty years.

CLAIRE: Okay. You have to swear to God you won’t laugh.

John motions a cross.

CLAIRE: Okay. I can’t believe I’m actually doing this.

She sticks a tube of lipstick between her breasts. She leans her head down and swings it either way. When she brings her head up, she’s successfully applied lipstick to her lips. The other kids clap.

ANDREW: Alright. Great. Where’d you learn to do that?

CLAIRE: Camp, seventh grade.

John keeps clapping.

JOHN: That was great, Claire.

She wipes the lipstick off.

JOHN: My image of you is totally blown.

ALLISON: You’re a shit. Don’t do that to her. You swore to God you wouldn’t laugh.

JOHN: Am I laughing?

ANDREW: You fucking prick.

JOHN: What do you care what I think anyway? I don’t even count, right? I could disappear forever and it wouldn’t make any difference. I may as well not even exist at this school, remember? And you don’t like me anyway.

CLAIRE: You know, I have just as many feelings as you do, and it hurts just as much when somebody steps all over them.

JOHN: God, you’re so pathetic. Don’t you ever, ever compare yourself to me, okay? You got everything and I got shit. Fucking Rapunzel, right? School would probably fucking shut down if you didn’t show up. Queenie isn’t here. I like those earrings, Claire.

CLAIRE: Shut up.

JOHN: Are those real diamonds, Claire?

CLAIRE: Shut up.

JOHN: I bet they are. Did you work for the money for those earrings?

CLAIRE: Shut your mouth.

JOHN: Or did your daddy buy those?

CLAIRE: Shut up!

JOHN: I bet he bought those for you. I bet those were a Christmas gift, right? You know what I got for Christmas this year? It was a banner fucking year at the old Bender family. I got a carton of cigarettes. The old man grabbed me and said, “Hey, smoke up, Johnny.” Okay? So go home and cry to your daddy. Don’t cry here, okay?

ANDREW: My God, are we gonna be like our parents?

CLAIRE: Not me. Ever.

ALLISON: It's unavoidable, it just happens.

CLAIRE: What happens?

ALLISON: When you grow up, your heart dies.

JOHN: Who cares?

ALLISON: I care.

BRIAN: I was thinking, I mean... I know it’s kind of a weird time, but I was just wondering, um… What is going to happen to us on Monday when we’re all together again? I mean, I consider you guys my friends. I’m not wrong, am I?

ANDREW: No.

BRIAN: So on Monday, what happens?

CLAIRE: Are we still friends, you mean? If we’re friends now, that is.

BRIAN: Yeah.

CLAIRE: Do you want the truth?

BRIAN: Yeah, I want the truth.

CLAIRE: I don’t think so.

ALLISON: With all of us? Or just John.

CLAIRE: With all of you.

ANDREW: That’s a real nice attitude, Claire.

CLAIRE: Oh, be honest, Andy. If Brian came walking up to you in the hall on Monday, what would you do? I mean, picture this. You’re there with all the sports. I know exactly what you’d do. You’d say hi to him, and when he left, you’d cut him all up so your friends wouldn’t think that you really liked him.

ANDREW: No way.

ALLISON: What if I came up to you?

CLAIRE: Same exact thing.

JOHN: You are a bitch.

CLAIRE: Why, ‘cause I’m telling the truth? That makes me a bitch?

JOHN: No, ‘cause you know how shitty that is to do to someone, and you don’t got the balls to stand up to your friends and tell them that you’re going to like who you want to like.

CLAIRE: Okay, what about you, you hypocrite? Why don’t you take Allison to one of your heavy metal vomit parties?

Allison chuckles.

CLAIRE: Or take Brian out to the parking lot at lunch to get high, or what about Andy for that matter? What about me? What would your friends say if we were walking down the hall together? They’d laugh their asses off. And you’d probably tell them that you were doing it with me so they’d forgive you for being seen with me.

JOHN: Don’t you ever talk about my friends. You don’t know any of my friends, you don’t look at any of my friends, and you certainly wouldn’t condescend to speak to any of my friends. So you just stick to the things that you know. Shopping, nail bolish, your father’s BMW, and your poor, rich, drunk mother in the Caribbean.

CLAIRE: Shut up!

JOHN: And as far as being concerned about what’s going to happen when you and I walk down the hallways at school, you can forget it, because it’s never going to happen. Just bury your head in the sand and wait for your fucking prom.

CLAIRE: I hate you.

JOHN: Yeah? Good.

BRIAN: Okay, then I assume Allison and I are better people than you guys, huh? Us weirdos. Would you… Would you do that to me?

ALLISON: I don’t have any friends.

BRIAN: Well, if you did.

ALLISON: No. I don’t think the kind of friends I’d have would mind.

BRIAN: I just wanna tell each of you that I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't and I will not! 'Cause I think that's real shitty.

CLAIRE: Your friends wouldn't mind because they look up to us.

BRIAN: You're so conceited, Claire. You're so conceited. You're so, like, full of yourself. Why are you like that?

CLAIRE: I'm not saying that to be conceited! I hate it! I hate having to go along with everything my friends say!

BRIAN: Well, then why do you do it?

CLAIRE: I don't know, I don't... You don't understand, you don't... You're not friends with the same kind of people that Andy and I are friends with. You know, you just don't understand the pressure that they can put on you.

BRIAN: I don't understand what? You think I don't understand pressure, Claire? Well, fuck you! Fuck you!

Brian begins to cry into his sleeve.

BRIAN: Know why I'm here today? Do you? I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a gun in my locker.

ANDREW: Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

BRIAN: I tried. You pull the fuckin' trunk on it and the light's s'posed to go on, and it didn't go on, I mean...

ANDREW: What's the gun for, Brian?

BRIAN: Just forget it.

ANDREW: You brought it up, man!

BRIAN: I can't have an F. I can't have it, and I know my parents can't have it. Even if I aced the rest of the semester, I'm still only a B. And everything's ruined for me.

CLAIRE: Brian…

He punches a chair nearby.

BRIAN: So I considered my options, you know?

CLAIRE: No, killing yourself is not an option.

BRIAN: Well I didn't do it, did I? No, I don't think so!

ALLISON: It was a handgun?

BRIAN: No, it was a flare gun. Went off in my locker.

ANDREW: Really?

Andrew begins to laugh.

BRIAN: It's not funny.

Andrew tries to stop himself but can’t contain his laughter. Allison and John try to hide their smiles. Brian starts to laugh after a moment as well.

BRIAN: Yes it is. Fuckin' elephant was destroyed!

ALLISON: You wanna know what I did to get in here? Nothing. I didn't have anything better to do.

Everyone begins to laugh.

ALLISON: You're laughing at me!

ANDREW: No!

ALLISON: Yeah, you are!

The laughter continues. Cut to Brian playing music on the radio in an office. Allison dances around the middle of the room. The camera follows her and we see John in the background shaking the statue while on top of it. Brian dances in the office. He throws some papers. Claire dances on the stairs. Andrew sits on a railing, drumming on his knee. A montage plays of the kids dancing in various ways and combinations. The montage ends and John makes his way back across the ceiling to the room he was locked in. the other four kids sit on a railing.

CLAIRE: Brian?

BRIAN: Hm?

CLAIRE: Are you going to write your paper?

BRIAN: Yeah, why?

CLAIRE: Well, it’s kind of a waste for all of us to write our paper, don’t you think?

BRIAN: Well, that’s what Vernon wants us to do.

CLAIRE: True, but I think we’d all kind of say the same thing.

BRIAN: You just don’t want to write your paper, right?

CLAIRE: True, but you’re the smartest, right?

BRIAN: Well, um.

CLAIRE: We trust you.

ANDREW: Yeah.

BRIAN: Alright. I’ll do it.

CLAIRE: Great.

Claire begins to stare at Allison. Allison stares back in response.

CLAIRE: Come on.

ALLISON: Where are we going?

CLAIRE Come on.

Claire gets up. Cut to a close up of Allison’s face as Claire does her makeup.

CLAIRE: Don’t be afraid.

ALLISON: Don’t stick that in my eye.

CLAIRE: I’m not sticking it, just close that- no, wait. Just go like that.

Claire makes a face. Allison copies it. Claire continues.

CLAIRE: Good. You know, you really do look a lot better without all that black shit on your eyes.

ALLISON: Hey, I like that black shit.

CLAIRE: This looks a lot better. Look up.

Brian sits at his desk, working on the paper. Andrew sits on a railing nearby. Claire continues with the makeup.

ALLISON: Please. Why are you being so nice to me?

CLAIRE: Cause you’re letting me.

Brian writes something down. John sits in the closet and looks up as the door opens. Claire enters.

JOHN: You lost?

Brian continues writing. Andrew looks up as Allison enters. She walks over. Andrew hops down from the railing. Brian looks up at her.

ALLISON: Thank you.

Back in the closet, Claire kisses John’s neck.

JOHN: Why’d you do that?

CLAIRE: ‘Cause I knew you wouldn’t.

JOHN: You know how you said before how your parents use you to get back at each other? Wouldn’t I be outstanding in that capacity?

CLAIRE: Were you really disgusted about what I did with my lipstick?

JOHN: Truth?

CLAIRE: Truth.

He nods.

JOHN: No.

Back in the detention room, Brian takes one last look at the paper and kisses it.

ANDREW: What happened to you?

ALLISON: Why? Claire did it.

He doesn’t say anything.

ALLISON: What’s wrong?

ANDREW: Nothing’s wrong. It’s just, you’re so different. I can see your face.

ALLISON: Is that good or bad?

ANDREW: It’s good.

She smiles. Brian gives himself a pat on the arm. Cut to the five of them walking through the hallway. They pass Carl on the way out.

CARL: See you Brian.

BRIAN: Hey, Carl.

JOHN: See you next Saturday.

CARL: You bet.

Cut to them exiting the building. Brian approaches his dad in the car. Andrew and Allison kiss. She rips a patch off of his jersey and walks to her car. Andrew’s dad pulls up. Andrew gets in the car. Claire gives John one of her earrings. He kisses her. She gets in the car and drives away. John puts on the earring she gave him. Cut to Vernon in the detention room reading Brian’s essay.

BRIAN: Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact that we had to sacrifice a whole Saturday in detention for whatever it was we did wrong. But we think you're crazy to make us write an essay telling you who we think we are. You see us as you want to see us: In the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.

As the letter continues, John walks across a football field.

BRIAN: But what we found out is that each one of us is a brain...

ANDREW: ...and an athlete...

ALLISON: ...and a basket case...

CLAIRE: ...a princess...

JOHN: ...and a criminal.

BRIAN: Does that answer your question? Sincerely yours, The Breakfast Club.

John throws a fist up into the air and the frame freezes.

844,2008,Daughtry,Feels Like Tonight,"[Verse 1]
You, you got me
Thinking it'll be alright
You, you told me
""Come and take a look inside""
You believe me
In every single lie
But I, I failed you this time

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
Tonight

[Verse 2]
I was waiting
For the day you'd come around
I was chasing
But nothing was all I found
From the moment you came into my life
You showed me what's right

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight
[Bridge]
I never felt like this before
Just when I leave, I'm back for more
Nothing else here seems to matter
In these ever-changing days
You're the one thing that remains
I could stay like this forever

[Chorus]
And it feels like tonight
I can't believe I'm broken inside
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

[Outro]
Tonight (feels like tonight)
Tonight (feels like tonight)
Can't you see that there's nothing that I wanna do
But try to make it up to you
And it feels like tonight

845,2008,Trace Adkins,You're Gonna Miss This,"[Verse 1]
She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
[Verse 3]
Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

[Chorus]
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna miss this
Yeah, you're gonna miss this"
846,2008,David Cook,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Not my son

(guitar solo)

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice"
847,2008,Taylor Swift,Our Song,"[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"
848,2008,James Otto,Just Got Started Lovin' You,"[Verse 1]
You don't have to go now honey
Call and tell 'em you won't be in today
Baby there ain't nothin' at the office
So important it can't wait
I'm thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

What's the point in fightin' what we're feelin'
We both know we'll never win
Ain't this what we're missin'
Let's just stop all this resistin' and give in
Let me wrap my arms around you
You know you don't want to leave this room
Come back and let me hold you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

[Chorus]
What can I say I've never felt this way
Girl you're like a dream come true
After all the love we've made
It sure would be a shame
If we let this moment end so soon
[Verse 2]
So won't you lay back down beside me
Girl just like I know you're wantin' to
Trust me when I tell you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you
I'm thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you
Come back and let me hold you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you

[Chorus]
What can I say I've never felt this way
Girl you're like a dream come true
After all the love we've made
It sure would be a shame
If we let this moment end so soon

I'm thankful for the weekend
But two days in heaven just ain't gonna do
This is gonna take forever darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you
Come back and let me hold you darlin'
Girl I just got started lovin' you"
849,2008,Rascal Flatts,Every Day,"[Verse 1]
You could have bowed out gracefully
But you didn't
You knew enough to know
To leave well enough alone
But you wouldn't
I drive myself crazy
Trying to stay out of my own way
The messes that I make
But my secrets are so safe
The only one who gets me
Yeah, you get me
It's amazing to me

[Chorus]
How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life

[Verse 2]
I come around all broken down and
Crowded out
And you're comfort
Sometimes the place I go
Is so deep and dark and desperate
I don't know, I don't know
[Chorus]
How every day
Every day, every day
You save my life

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I swear, I don't know if
I'm coming or going
But you always say something
Without even knowing
That I'm hanging on to your words
With all of my might and it's alright
Yeah, I'm alright for one more night-
Every day
Every day, every day, every day
Every day, every day
You save me, you save me, oh, oh, oh
Every day
Every, every, every day-

Every day you save my life"

My hands are searching for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you
This fire runs in through my being
Burning I'm not used to seeing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive

[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing say we are alone with you
I am alone and they are too with you

With four fantastic hoes cause I got a deal-ly

853,2008,Kenny Chesney,Better As A Memory,"[Verse 1]
I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Verse 2]
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man
[Bridge]
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

[Verse 3]
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man"

Telling me that she wants to own me

Never last strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Ooh, no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before

And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love, ooh, 'cause

In your heart is sent from (Sent from heaven) (Sent from heaven)

And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

858,2008,Lifehouse,Whatever It Takes,"[Verse 1]
A strangled smile fell from your face
It kills me that I hurt you this way
The worst part is that I didn't even know
Now there's a million reasons for you to go
But if you can find a reason to stay

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance, believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

[Verse 2]
She said ""If we're going to make this work
You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see""
She said, ""Like it or not it's the way it's gotta be
You gotta love yourself if you can ever love me""

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance and give me a break
I'll keep us together, I know you deserve much better
[Bridge]
But remember the time I told you the way that I felt
That I'd be lost without you and never find myself
Let's hold onto each other above everything else
Start over, start over

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance, believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes"

860,2008,Ashanti,The Way That I Love You,"[Chorus]
After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)

[Verse 1]
I woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
Felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it
I didn't complain or say nothing
I tried to act like I didn't see it
'Cause deep down, I knew I didn't wanna believe it
There it was, it was you and her, you left your sidekick on the nightstand
And I read

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything you did and everything you said
Now I'm standing here looking like damn
I thought it was you and I
Now all I got to say is why

[Chorus]
After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)
Ohh, ohh, ohh
[Verse 2]
I notice now that when I'm around you be tryna lock the doors, whispering on the phone
Now wait a minute, since we been in this house, you ain't never did this before
Tell me what's this about, I tried to sit and say to myself
This here is too good, he don't want nothing else
But there it was, it was you and her
You left the credit card receipt inside the beamer with

[Pre-Chorus]
Everything you bought
Everything you spent, now I'm standing here once again
I thought it was you and I, now all I've got to say is
Why

[Chorus]
After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love)
The way that I love (The way that I love you)

[Bridge]
Ohh, ohh, ohh
You lied, you lied, oh why, oh why?
Can't, why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why'd you have to lie to me?
Why?
[Chorus]
After all of the times that we tried
I found out we were living a lie
And after all of this love that we made
I know now you don't love me the same
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)
The way that I love (The way that I loved you)

[Outro]
Ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ohh"
861,2008,Britney Spears,Break The Ice,"[Spoken Intro]
It's been a while
I know I shouldn't've kept you waiting
But I'm here now

[Verse 1]
I know it's been a while, but I'm glad you came
And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name
You got my body spinning, like a hurricane
And it feels like you got me going insane
And I can't get enough
So, let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
[Interlude]
So, are you warming up yet?

[Verse 2]
You got me hypnotized
I never felt this way
You got my heart beating like an 808
Can you rise to the occasion?
I'm patiently waiting, 'cause it's getting late
And I can't get enough, so let me get it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, looks like we're alone now
You ain't gotta be scared, we're grown now
I'ma hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin'
We can turn the heat up if ya wanna
Turn the lights down low if ya wanna
Just wanna move ya, but you froze up
That's what I'm saying

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
[Spoken Interlude]
I like this part, oh
It feels kinda good
Yeah

[Chorus]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Hot

[Outro]
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot
Let me break the ice
Allow me to get you right
Once ya warm up to me
Baby, I can make you feel hot, hot, hot, hot"
862,2008,Lady Antebellum,Love Don't Live Here,"[Verse 1]
Well, this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, when I would curse your name
Hey!
Well I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back

[Pre-Chorus]
Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh no
[Verse 2]
Well baby, you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you
I think it's best you go

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
Oh, should've known
Now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore

[Bridge]
Oh no
That love don't live here anymore
[Outro]
Oh no, no
Sugar no, no
And you don't live here anymore
And love don't live here anymore
And since you walked out of my door
Love don't live here
Love don't live here, girl
Oh, love don't live here anymore"
863,2008,Flobots,Handlebars,"[Intro]
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars, no handlebars
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars, no handlebars
[Verse 1]
Look at me, look at me
Hands in the air like it's good to be
Alive, and I'm a famous rapper
Even when the paths are all crooked-y
I can show you how to do-si-do
I can show you how to scratch a record
I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""De Colores""
And I'm proud to be an American
Me and my friends saw a platypus
Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took?
I can do anything that I want 'cause look—

[Chorus 1]
I can keep rhythm with no metronome
No metronome, no metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone, on the telephone
[Verse 2]
Look at me, look at me
Just called to say that it's good to be
Alive, in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read
I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers, shakers, and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause—

[Chorus 2]
I can lead a nation with a microphone
With a microphone, with a microphone
And I can split the atom of a molecule
Of a molecule, of a molecule

[Trumpet Solo]​

[Verse 3]
Look at me, look at me, driving and I won't stop
And it feels so good to be alive and on top
My reach is global, my tower secure
My cause is noble, my power is pure
I can hand out a million vaccinations
Or let 'em all die in exasperation
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
Or have 'em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because—
[Chorus 3]
I can guide a missile by satellite
By satellite, by satellite
And I can hit a target through a telescope
Through a telescope, through a telescope
And I can end the planet in a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
In a holocaust (Ah!)
(Ah!)
[Outro]
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars, no handlebars
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
No handlebars, no handlebars"

He said, ""Hey, sister, it's really, really nice to meet ya""
I just met this 5-foot-7 guy who's just my type
Like the way he's speakin', his confidence is peakin'
Don't like his baggy jeans but I might like what's underneath them
And, no, I ain't been to MIA
I heard that Cali never rains and New York's all the way
First let's see the West End, I'll show you to my bredrin
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy
[Chorus 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you

Can we get away this weekend? Take me to Broadway
Let's go shopping, maybe then we'll go to a café
Let's go on the subway, take me to your hood
I never been to Brooklyn and I'd like to see what's good
Dressed in all your fancy clothes
Sneakers lookin' fresh to death, I'm lovin' those Shell Toes
Walkin' that walk, talk that slick talk
I'm likin' this American boy, American boy

[Chorus 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy
Tell 'em wagwan, blud!
[Verse 3: Kanye West with Estelle]
Who killin' them in the UK?
Everybody gonna say, ""You, K""
Reluctantly, 'cause most of this press don't fuck with me
Estelle once said to me, ""Cool down, down
Don't act a fool now, now.""
I always act a fool oww, oww
Ain't nothing new now, now
He crazy, I know what you thinkin'
Ribena, I know what you're drinkin'
Rap singer, chain blinger
Holler at the next chick soon as you're blinkin'
What's your persona about this Americana rhymer?
Am I shallow 'cause all my clothes designer? Uh
Dressed smart like a London bloke (Yeah)
Before he speak his suit bespoke (Woop)
And you thought he was cute before
Look at this pea coat, tell me he's broke (Woo)
And I know you ain't into all that
I heard your lyrics, I feel your spirit
But I still talk that ca-a-ash
'Cause a lotta wags wanna hear it
And I'm feelin' like Mike at his baddest
Like The Pips at their gladdest
And I know they love it
So to hell with all that rubbish
[Bridge: Estelle]
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Would you be my love, my love?
Would you be mine?
Could you be my love, my love? (Ooh)
Would you be my American boy? American boy

[Chorus 2: Estelle]
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day (Ooh, someday)
Take me to Chicago, San Francisco Bay (I wanna see the Bay)
I really want to (You) come kick it with you (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You'll be my American boy, American boy (Be my American boy)

[Chorus 1: Estelle]
Take me on a trip I'd like to go some day (I'd like to go some day)
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA (See LA)
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American boy, American boy

Will you be my American boy?"
865,2008,Coldplay,Violet Hill,"[Verse 1]
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

[Refrain]
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

[Refrain]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

[Refrain]
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

[Outro]
I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?"

Had to put some foldin' chairs in the vestibule
Yeah, it's gettin' full
Even old Aunt Ruby came
Her first time on an airplane
It's her sister's girl
She wouldn't miss it for the world

Pre Chorus

And all them kids jumpin' in the pews
And Mr. Charlie in his lime-green suit
'Is a handsome man'
Remarks Widow Callahan
Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go

Chorus

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love is a beautiful thing
2nd Verse

Daddy's waitin' with the bride
Yeah, she helps him with his tie
She sees a tear
He says, 'Man, it's hot in here' hmm
He hugs his little girl and asks
'How did you grow up so fast?
God, I wish your Momma could be here for this'

Pre Chorus

And everybody stands and smiles
As she goes walkin' down the aisle
In her Momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago
And said their vows
Yeah, I guess it's workin' out

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

A little table full'a gifts
Catering's covered dish
And the wedding band
Well, that's on her hand
And Tommy's teasin' Lorelei
He pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows
A day will come
Tag Chorus

When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher gets to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s

Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love
Two people in love is a beautiful thing"
868,2008,George Strait,I Saw God Today,"[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today
[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today"

State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone

Andy: ...Just pretty or...
David: ...Nah. Well I mean. Yeah. The...uh...atom, it's not really...I mean it's a symbol. You see that and you think atom. It shows electrons moving in elliptical paths around a nucleus and all...we know...
Andy: Mmhmm
David: ...That's...that's not how an atom works. Or...or looks even, for that matter...
Andy: Okay
David: ...And so....and so that's why it was appropriate for the cover, you know...
Andy: Right. Uhmm. Ok. Yeah. I'm not really sure I see the connection. But...
David: ...Well...and what we mean to say is that the elements of worship are inadequate, much like the atom depiction. But this is what we have you know? It helps us carry the idea
Andy: Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Uhmm. Ok. Uh. Tell...ok...what's the deal with these little songs between the real...you know, the real songs? Like are they significant? Uhmm...is there like a theme of the album? Or are they creating space? Like what's...going on there?

If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (ayy)
Diamonds on my pinky (ayy), hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, 84s on the frame

Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like

Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop

37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in

I'm doing me like Siamese incest
We're about to raise up the roof like bench press
All the pretty girls in the place start dancin'
And all the nerds in the place start spazzin'
No gown, no gavel, no judgment
And baby girl swallows like it's Robitussin
Ugh
Now that's distasteful
And niggas talking trash and that's just wasteful
I don't need to say how I'm a great MC
I'll just sit back and let my words speak for me
Do re mi fa so la ti do
That's fake orange juice I call that Tarentino
And that's Pulp Fiction
You found a new addiction
Comeback Music's what you've been missin
McCloud
David is the 1st name
Similar to Bruce Wayne
I'm on fire where's the Propane

New kids on the block we're fresh to undeath

Dancing on the floor can you keep up girl
All they can say is let me catch my breath
All they can say is let me catch my breath (x2)

Give me a second let me catch my breath

[Verse 2: Kid Raven]

Oh no it's the kids are back off the shelf
Making new sounds that you have never felt
Vibrating on rhythm yes its a new culture
The nerd is back guess I'm the one who told ya
So come on girl move those hips around
Whenever the kids are coming back in town
Taking shots, who called in the firing squad
I make music just to hear the crowd applaud
(Yaaaaaaay)
Why am I lying I make music cuz I love it
So much to the point that no one I know is above it
Enjoying the party when the music turns on
Keep it going on night like a bedroom marathon
(Bang Bang)
I beat the drums real hard
Let me stop now before I take it too far
To the next level is where this song's taking me
Regenerating my power like I took a hit of V
Cuz yes I'm a monster, we've established this
Vampire teeth showing, would you like a kiss
From the sin-inspiring creature that I am
Girls only know me cuz I make them go Ka-Blam
At the end of the night, they're melting like Melt-Man
Brusing up the skin, changing them like a sun tan
Girls say I'm smooth so they call me lotion
Hey what can I say, Sinsation is the man

When I walk in you bitches know I'm here to smack face
Do it on the 1st try, never hit a backspace
Wanna blow me, now you should've done it in the 1st place
Praising the Lord but you're living on my grace
I can screw girls who wouldn't let you get to 1st base
Word around the campfire, rapper's saying I'm fake
Acting like It's my fault I'm whiter than a milkshake
But I get all the love cuz I get them so baked

Hmm and her butter milk lipstick
Give a little something to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could shake like that

Hottie, she's a Hottie! She got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rockin' that cowboy hat
Hottie, she's a Hottie! And just a little bit naughty
Singing Kayay digidigy
Kayay digidigy, yey Hey hey hey Hey

[Verse 5]
Dress her up boys, I took her from the farm
I brought her downtown, I hung her on my arm
You've got to give a little somethin' to a cool dark cat
Finding him a woman who could walk like that!
She's a Hottie, she's a Hottie! She's got a smokin' little body
String bikini and a barbed-wire tat (tattoo)
She's rocking' that cowboy hat

880,2008,Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"[Verse 1]
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure
[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

Brr da ba mmm da ba bo mmm day

Baby, do you believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, hmm"
881,2008,Montgomery Gentry,Back When I Knew It All,"[Verse 1]
At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""Tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Verse 2]
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all
[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Bridge]
I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all"

Jones Beach, 1988
Come on

[Verse 1]
Do you remember or should I rewind?
To that summer when you caught my eye?
I played it cool, the weather was hot
You had the beauty & the beach on lock
With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

[Pre-Chorus]
I was like ""Hey, girl, can I get your number?""
I remember what you told me too
""Don't call after 10:00""
But you know that I did
Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'about you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
[Verse 2]
Do you remember? I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool, the feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked
In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it?
And I wonder if you miss it too?
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'about you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
[Bridge]
(Break it down)
Summer ended, winter started
It got colder when we parted ways
(I like this part)
As the seasons change
(Now bring it, bring it back)
Winter melted, spring, I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
Without you, my summertime
My summertime

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime"
883,2008,Taylor Swift,Should've Said No,"[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"

885,2008,Dierks Bentley,Trying To Stop Your Leaving,"[Verse]
Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a coming
It'll be here before too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl that's kind of what I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door

[Outro]
Train's a coming, river's running
Train's a coming, river's running
Pain's a coming, tears are running
Yeah that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving"

887,2008,Julianne Hough,That Song In My Head,"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)
I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day"

It's gon' be the best though, promise
Just one last time

It's the way you flip your hair and those stylish clothes you wear
When you walk into the room, all my partners stopped and stared at you
But they just been the usual
It's the tattoo on your back and that brand new Louie bag
With them matchin' high heels; I can't help this girl's swag's the truth
And I just want to give her love, oh

[Lil Wayne]
Ah ha ha, yeah
OK I'm thinkin' of a master plan
Nah, I'm lyin', shorty on my mind

Nothin' but sweat inside my hands
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent
But I don't need a cent, cause shorty priceless
I tell it like this, I been (all around the world)
So baby I can take you (all around the world)
I roll up, this is a hold up; it's Young Money man
Shorty made me smile when ain't a damn thing funny
Heh heh, but still don't nothin' move but the money
So baby if I move then we move with the money
Which is my favorite dish
But if I taste you that'll probably switch
And then we will probably switch
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this

Born Helena Jane
With a restless soul
She moved west to California
Became a centerfold
But once you change your name
Well the pieces fall
Now she hardly recognizes, her
Herself at all

[Pre-Chorus]
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all

[Chorus]
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
So long
Put your blue jeans back on, girl
Go home
Remember, Hollywood's not America
Oh yeah
[Verse 2]
And everybody here's
From somewhere else
You can make a million dollars
Well, you might lose yourself
And you can take the heat
Will your heart grow cold?
They say acting's just pretending, and
But even that gets old

[Chorus]
And there's never any rain
When you want it
A hollow little game
And you've won it
Looking for a thrill
But you've done it all

Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Kanye West]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? (Yeah)
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It’s just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

[Chorus]
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good

Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
""Man, it feels good to feel this way""
Now I know what I mean
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do

Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do

897,2008,Chris Cagle,What Kinda Gone,"I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here
Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout

Take the light
And darken everything around me

Call your name every day

I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this

When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room

[RACHEL]
A smell of wine and cheap perfume

For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill

Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose

Some are born to sing the blues
And oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people, livin' just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Hold on to that feelin'

905,2009,Linkin Park,New Divide,"[Verse 1]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide
Across this new divide"

Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever, when you feel you’ve lost your way
And what if my chances are already gone?
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

[Chorus]
With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

[Verse 2]
I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe, but I always knew why
I always knew why
[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can

You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries
Above and beneath you
Break every rule 'cause there’s nothing between you and your dreams

With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
Yeah
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain

You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

Sometimes, love comes around

And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down

Said if I could go back and (Make it happen faster)
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? (Oh)

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby; we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes

How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying; now, I'm crashing (Oh)

And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did

Washed them in the bathroom to drink like the bands
And the setlist (Setlist) you stole off the stage
Has red and purple lipstick all over the page
Br—br—br—bruises cover your arms
Shaking in the fingers with the bottle in your palm
And the best is (Best is), no one knows who you are
Just another girl alone at the bar
[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me

Shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips
I said shush girl, shut your lips
Do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips

[Chorus: Nathaniel Motte & Sean Foreman]
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me
She wants to touch me, woah-oh
She wants to love me, woah-oh
She’ll never leave me, woah-oh, woah-oh, oh-oh
Don’t trust a ho, never trust a ho
Won’t trust a ho ‘cause the ho won’t trust me"

I can almost see it
That dream I'm dreaming, but
There's a voice inside my head saying
""You'll never reach it""
Every step I'm taking
Every move I make feels lost, with no direction
My faith is shaken

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I, I gotta keep trying
Gotta keep my head held high

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

[Verse 2]
The struggles I'm facing
The chances I'm taking
Sometimes might knock me down, but
No, I'm not breaking
I may not know it
But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah
Just gotta keep going
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I, I gotta be strong
Just keep pushing on, 'cause...

[Chorus]
There's always gonna be another mountain
I'm always gonna wanna make it move
Always gonna be an uphill battle
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
Ain't about how fast I get there
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side
It's the climb

There's always gonna be another mountain

In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless
How could you be so heartless?
Oh.. how could you be so heartless?

How could you be so, cold as the winter wind when it breeze yo
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You know need to watch the way you talkin' to me you know
I mean after all the things that we've been through
I mean after all the things we got into
Yo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Yo, I did some things but that's the old me
And now you wanna get me back and you goin' show me
So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well I got homies
But in the end it's still so lonely

In the night, I hear 'em talk, the coldest story ever told
Somewhere far along this road, he lost his soul
To a woman so heartless

How could be so Dr. Evil, you bringin' out the side of me that I don't know

I won't stop, I won't mess my groove up 'cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you leavin' me

You wait a couple months then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

I know you can't believe

By the way, I made it through the day
I watched the world outside
By the way, I'm leaving out today

Well, I just saw Halley's comet, she waved
Said, ""Why you always runnin' in place?""

Somewhere in the stratosphere

Tell my mother, tell my father

To make them realize, this is my life
I hope they understand

All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going no where
Going no where
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very, mad world, mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me
Look right through me

And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had

It's a very, very, mad world, mad world

To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow

Call up my homies

We keep a fadeaway shot

Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand

Time to get paid, it's maximum wage

926,2009,Jason Mraz,I'm Yours,"[Verse 1]
Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure
[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
A-do you, do, do, do you, but do you, do you, do, do, but do you want to come on?
Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

[Outro]
Brr da ba mmm da ba bo mmm day

Baby, do you believe I'm yours?
You best believe, you best believe I'm yours, hmm"
927,2009,The All-American Rejects,Gives You Hell,"[Verse 1]
I wake up every evening
With a big smile on my face
And it never feels out of place
And you're still probably working
At a nine to five pace
I wonder how bad that tastes

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell

[Verse 2]
Now where's your picket fence, love?
And where's that shiny car?
And did it ever get you far?
You never seemed so tense, love
I've never seen you fall so hard
Do you know where you are?

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
If you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
I hope it gives you hell
[Verse 3]
Tomorrow, you'll be thinking to yourself
""Yeah, where did it all go wrong?""
But the list goes on and on

[Pre-Chorus]
And truth be told, I miss you
And truth be told, I'm lying

[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell

[Bridge]
Now, you'll never see what you've done to me
You can take back your memories, they're no good to me
And here's all your lies, you can look me in the eyes
With the sad, sad look that you wear so well
[Breakdown]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell
When you find a man that's worth a damn and treats you well
Then he's a fool, you're just as well, hope it gives you hell
[Chorus]
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell!)
When you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)
When you hear this song and you sing along, no you never tell (No you never tell)
Then you're the fool, I'm just as well, hope it gives you hell (Hope it gives you hell)

[Outro]
When you hear this song, I hope that it will give you hell
(Give you hell)
You can sing along, I hope that it puts you through hell"
928,2009,T.I. Featuring Justin Timberlake,Dead And Gone,"[Intro: T.I.]
Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?
[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)

Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Maybe I was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryna pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go

'Cause we belong together now, yeah, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you, yeah
'Cause we belong together now, yeah (Together now)
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me

My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you"
930,2009,The Fray,You Found Me,"[Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
[Verse 2]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
For early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want
[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?"
931,2009,Kelly Clarkson,I Do Not Hook Up,"[Verse 1]
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys'll be boys, oh, yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're lookin' for thrills, then get cold feet

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well
[Chorus]
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over
With a snap of your finger, oh, no

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve

Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going?

Broken-hearted in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

936,2009,Kris Allen,Ain't No Sunshine,"Ain't No Sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no Sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna to stay
Ain't No Sunshine when she's gone

And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know I know I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know....

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

Anytime she goes away

Anytime she goes away
Anytime she goes away"
937,2009,Zac Brown Band,Whatever It Is,"[Verse 1]
She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife
[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Bridge]
When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you"" (I do)
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is"
938,2009,Brad Paisley,Then,"[Verse 1]
I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 2]
I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then
[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

[Verse 3]
I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
We'll look back someday
At this moment that we're in
And I'll look at you and say
And I thought I loved you then
And I thought I loved you then

939,2009,Nickelback,If Today Was Your Last Day,"[Verse 1]
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)
[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)

'Oh what the hell' she says 'I just can't win for losing'
And she lays back down
Man there's so many times
I don't know what I'm doin'
Like I don't know now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

[Chorus]
And she says 'ooh
I can't take no more'
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down (way down)
[Verse 2]
Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (all night)
And I know I could break her concentration
Oh, but it don't feel right

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
So I sit down and I cry too
But don't let her see

[Chorus]
And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down

She shuts out the night
And tries to close her eyes
If she can find daylight
Then she'll be all right
She'll be all right
Just not tonight

And she says ooh
I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She's down in it
She tried her best and now she can't win, it's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling
Oh I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She down with it
She tried her best and now she can't win, It's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)

942,2009,Sugarland,It Happens,"[Verse 1]
Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens

[Verse 2]
My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
""I'll be right back,"" going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
""Sorry 'bout your neck baby""
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

Ain't no rhyme or reason

If I wrote a note to God
I would speak what's in my soul
I'd ask for all the hate
To be swept away
For love to overflow

If I wrote a note to God
I'd pour my heart out on each page
I'd ask for war to end
And for peace to mend this world
I'd say, I'd say

I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on

[Verse 2:]
If I wrote a note to God
I'd say please help us find a way
End all the bitterness
Put some tenderness in our hearts
I'd say, I'd say

I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it looks like
We haven't got a clue

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope

So much is going wrong

Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my cash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)

I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes

Can't tell a grown man what to do with his

But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese

Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)
[Hook]

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033
It's my son's birthday my boy turned 3, and looking at him is like looking at me
Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

I tried my best at movin' on, have yet to find a girl like you
See things now, I didn't before now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about then never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep
It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

Baby all that I hear from my friends again, again and again (They come and ask about you, they say)
We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you
Not only does your body bang but I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you couldn't go to sleep, can't think, can't eat
'Til I come see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep (how do you sleep)

(Interlude from Ludacris)
Look
Now it's been about a year
And I'm tryin' to figure out, how could ya
Forget about who loves you the most, why would ya

Heal my heart, heal my brain and
Oh how I wish you could feel my pain
Cause I couldn't get you off my mind, if I tried

Twenty-four/seven, three six five
And my nights so cold, days so long
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Well it's gone and I'm trippin', how much I miss it
And you steady walkin' round, like I never existed
And it's hard to understand, you got another plan
Tryin' to play hard, that you got another man

But you'll never find another like moi
That'll ridin' you round in a drop-top car
Baby you're a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we sow it

LUDA!

It's been about a year now, ain't seen or heard from you
I been missin' you crazy, how do you, how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me, it still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories

953,2009,Maino Featuring T-Pain,All The Above,"[Hook: T-Pain]
Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness
[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

Guess who? D'you miss me?
Jessica Simpson, sing the chorus!

[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby) (Yeah)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl

When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)

The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim

When you walked through the door (Woo!)

And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt

There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar

There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound

And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in

Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name

Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?

Ain't jealousy funny?

'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The lovin' look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories (our memories)
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep (you can't keep)
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise"

They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official

It's never enough to say I'm sorry
It's never enough to say I care
But I'm caught between what you wanted from me
And knowing that if I give that to you
I might just disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Nobody wins when everyone's losing

[Chorus]
It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind
I know it's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want
And it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

It's never enough to say I love you
No, it's never enough to say I try
It's hard to believe
That's theres no way out for you and me
And it seems to be the story of our lives

963,2009,Kenny Chesney,Out Last Night,"[Verse 1]
We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

[Verse 2]
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

[Bridge]
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight
When we went out last night"
964,2009,Billy Currington,People Are Crazy,"[Verse 1]
This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were having us some beers and
Swapping I don't cares

[Verse 2]
Talking politics
Blonde and red-haired chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked

[Bridge]
We talked about God's grace
And all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say

[Chorus]
God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Verse 3]
He said ""I fought two wars
Been married and divorced""
What brings you to Ohio?
He said ""Damned if I know""
[Verse 4]
We talked an hour or two
'Bout every girl we knew
What all we put them through
Like two old boys will do

[Bridge]
We pondered life and death
He lit a cigarette
Said ""These damn things will kill me yet""

[Chorus]
But God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

[Break]
Last call is 2 a.m
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again

[Verse 3]
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page obituary
He was a millionaire-y
[Verse 4]
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell
Huh, but me
I'm doing well

[Bridge]
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
I left a six-pack
Right there on his grave
And I said

God is great
Beer is good
And people are crazy

And people are crazy

Got me ten feet off the ground

But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait

And suppose I cried and said I think I've finally learned my lesson
And I'm tired of spendin' all my time alone

[Verse 2: Carrie Underwood]
If I told you that I realized you're all I ever wanted
And it's killin' me to be so far away
Would you tell me that you love me too? And would we cry together
Or would you simply laugh at me and say

I told you so, oh, I told you so
I told you some day you'd come crawlin' back and askin' me to take you in
I told you so, but you had to go
And now I've found somebody new and you will never break my heart in two again

Would you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?
And you've waited for the day that I returned

Four letter word just to get me along
It's a difficulty and I'm biting on my tongue
And I, I keep stalling, not keeping me together
People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane

Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now

Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not

Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'

[Verse 1]
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way
And what if my chances were already gone
I started believing that I could be wrong
But you gave me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
So here I am still holding on

[Chorus]
With every step you climb another mountain
With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

I fought to the limit, to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down

I risk being safe
I always knew why
I always knew why
So here I am still holding on

972,2009,Jason Michael Carroll,Where I'm From,"On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And ""Amazing Grace"" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from
And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace
It's where I'm from
How sweet the sound
It's where I'm from
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, amazing grace"

I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm

'Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see
I will fuck with all y'all, all of y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one, so you can never say I'm choosing hoes
And Wayne say, ""Pussy, pussy, pussy""
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of staying with her
She bring that friend around and make a nigga reconsider
And then...

[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Jae Millz]
'Cause we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh...
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I—I—I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
Calling all sexy ladies
Oh, oh, ahh
[Verse 3: Jae Millz]
But, um, I ain't being disrespectful, baby, I'm just bein' Millz
And I don't know how fake feels, so I gotta keep it real
I just want to fuck every girl in the world
Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every high-saditty chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper, and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Wilt, so, married women or MILF
It don't matter who you is, miss—you can get ""Tha Bizness""
Ha!

[Verse 4: Gudda Gudda]
These hoes is God's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair, thick ass
Ugh, and I swear I'm feelin' all of y'all
I'm scrollin' down my call log, and I'ma call all of y'all
My butter-pecan, Puerto Rican
She screamin' out, ""Papi!"" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hilary can Rodham too, boy, I gets my pimpin' on

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
'Cause we like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
We like her (Hey), and we like her, too
And we like her, and she like us, too, and oh...
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world (Oh, oh, ahh)

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

Sanna Lathan, Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie, ha, D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all-nighters
In about three years, holla at me, Miley Cyrus
I don't discriminate, no, not at all
Kit-Kat a midget, if that ass soft, I break her off
I exchange V-cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like Dior 'cause he are
Mack Mizzle, baby
'Cause he are Mack Mizzle, baby

I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road
And it's not like her to drive that slow, nothin's on the radio
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell
She usually comes right in, now I can tell

[Chorus]
Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

[Verse 2]
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

Here comes goodbye
Here comes the last time
Here comes the start of every sleepless night
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry
Here comes the pain
Here comes me wishing things had never changed

Why does it have to go from good to gone?
Before the lights turn on, yeah and youre left alone
All alone, but here comes goodbye

Left all alone

Feel me in your bones

980,2009,Eli Young Band,Always The Love Songs,"[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most
[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs
Always the love songs, always the love songs"

Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus 1]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus 2]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other

One life, but we're not the same

They were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
As they handed me my glass, smiling thinking to myself
Man, what a picture-perfect postcard this would make of America

It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America

[Verse 2]
Later on when I got home, I flipped the TV on
I saw a little town that some big twister tore apart
And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out
And I was thinking to myself I'm so glad that I live in America

It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade

Now we might not always get it all right
There's no place else I'd rather build my life

Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest,"" the next day my mother said
""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck

I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?""

""Did you get him?"" Nah, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw

Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along!

Don't you know what felch means? (""Yeah"") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching (Urrp!)
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" — I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting!
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no! — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene!""

Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

Maybe later on we'll walk down to the river
Lay on a blanket and stare up at the moon
It may not be no French Riviera
But it's all the same to me as long as I'm with you
[Pre-Chorus 2]
May be a simple life but that's okay, yeah
If you ask me baby, I think I've got it made

[Hook]
Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need
And it's alright by me

[Bridge]
When I lay down at night I thank the lord above
For giving me everything I ever could dream of

Because I got a roof over my head
The woman I love laying in my bed
And it's alright, alright
I got shoes under my feet
Forever in the eyes staring back at me
And it's alright, alright
Yeah, I got all I need

I'm nice right now man
I-I feel good
If you have a drink
Would you please put it in the air?

[Chorus]
That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off
And had this one girl completely naked
Drink my beer and smoke my weed
But my good friends is all I need
Pass out at three, wake up at ten
Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

[Verse 1]
I wanna go to college for the rest of my life
Sip Bankers Club, and drink Miller Lite
On Thirsty Thursday and Tuesday Night Ice
And I can get pizza a dollar a slice
So fill up my cup, let's get fucked up (Let's get fucked up!)
I'm next on the table, who want what
I am champion, at beer pong
Allen Iverson, Hakeem Olajuwon
Don't even bounce, not in my house
Better hope you make it, otherwise, you naked
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is, um

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)
I danced my ass off

I can't tell you what I learned from school
But, I could tell you a story or two
Um, yeah, of course, I learned some rules
Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

That party last night
Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it (I wish we taped it)

Two bitches, go'n'n' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unorthodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop

And you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams

And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

(If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around

I came wrong, you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby, believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times, better days
And I miss you more and more

If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around

Words fall through me and always fool me and I can't react
And games that never amount to more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly eyes that know me and I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me and I'm painted black
You have suffered enough and warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice you had the choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing along"

Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it 'til you took it back

Keep walking forward, now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home

Ralph Lauren, Purple Label; ain't I fresh as I can be?
Made it through my situation; ain't I blessed as I can be?
Ain't I laughing at you haters tryna take a shot at me?
They don't know which way to go—I'll make it easy: Follow me
Honestly, ain't I insane? I think that's the way I gotta be
Ain't I so, so superfly? Boy, ain't nobody hot as me
Ain't T.I. all on TV when he wake up and go to sleep? (Ain't he?)
Everywhere, they notice me—ayy, for yourself, just go and see
My community, I'm serving, though they hope I don't succeed
Hear me speak, they so intrigued—""Ayy, ain't he snitching?"" No, indeed
You come with that common flow (Well), your show, I have to commandeer
Since I see you can't take over, I'll just have to volunteer (Yeah, yeah)
Ayy, ain't I your superior? Listen here, bruh: you not a peer
I'm so Zone 1 that it ain't funny, twice the G that I appear (Hahaha)
Rep Bankhead so loud and clear (Bankhead!), gon' be gone for 'bout a year
So Paper Trail, you gotta hear, but ain't that ""Ain't I"" outta here? Ayy!

996,2009,Toby Keith,Lost You Anyway,"[Verse 1]
Maybe you were right, maybe I could have changed
Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things
What's a man to say when all the questions start
Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

[Verse 2]
I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

[Chorus]
Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway
[Outro]
Let the world revolve around you
And given you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway"

She love the way I move, I sh, I show it to her
Shows about 100, goon

Black car, black flags
I really hope that's money that ya'll got off in them black bags

Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy
