Yeah

[Verse 1]
I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

[Chorus]
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

[Bridge]
I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey

Doja! Rrr

[Doja Cat:]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

[Nicki Minaj:]
Every time I take a break, the game be so boring
Pretty like Naomi, Cassie, plus Lauren
Spittin' like Weezy, Foxy, plus Lauryn
Ball like the ram, see, now that's Gordon
They don't understand the bag talk, I'm foreign
When they think they top the queen, they start fallin'
Word to my ass-shots, I'm so cheeky
Got 'em tryna palm my ass like young Keke
Yes, I'm ghetto, word to Gepetto
Plus I'm little, where's my stiletto?
Tell Mike Jordan, send me my Retros
Used to be bi, but now I'm just hetero
Ain't talkin' medicine, but I made 'em morphine
Ever since I put the cookie on quarantine
He know this thing A1 like a felony
All he gotta do is say the word like a spelling bee
[Doja Cat:]
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?

[Doja Cat:]
Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Yeah you know it
Yeah you know it
Yeah you know it
Yeah you know it

You could've said so
Boy, you shoulda said so
Say so, say so

[Nicki Minaj:]
I got dressed just to sit in the house
People with the least always doin' the most
I'm countin' money while he suckin' my toes
Real nasty with them balls, all net, yeah, I'm gross
Why you talkin' 'bout who body fake?
With all them fillers in your face, you just full of hate
That real ass ain't keep your nigga home

Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary

Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

[Verse 1]
I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me
[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah

[Verse 2]
Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah
[Chorus]
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at"

9,2020,Future Featuring Drake,Life Is Good,"[Part I]

[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Verse: Drake]
Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit
[Chorus: Drake]
Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual (Like usual)
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

[Interlude: Future]
It's cool, man, got red bottoms on
Life is good, you know what I mean? Like

[Part II]

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemars-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since, woo

[Verse 1: Future]
Granny, she was standin' right there while I catch a play on a brick, woo
I make them lil' niggas go haywire, Taliban in this bitch, woo
I done been down bad in them trenches, had to ride with that stick, woo
Who gave you pills? Who gave you that dust? Pluto sent you on a lick, woo
Too many convicts that roll with me to play in this shit, woo
I'm tryna avoid nonsense, get Osama spray in this bitch, woo
They at the candlelight lightin' it up, nigga, anybody can get it, woo
I'm on a PJ lightin' it up, Backwood full of sticky, woo
I'm tryna tote that Draco in London and it's extended, woo
They gotta stretch a nigga out, we gon' die for this shit, woo
Yeah, I ride for my niggas, I lie to my bitch, woo
We some poor, high-class niggas, made it, we rich, yeah
I was at the bando, got a penthouse for a closet, woo
It's like a chandelier on my neck, my wrist, woo
I got pink toes that talk different languages, woo
Got Promethazine in my blood and Percocet, yeah
[Chorus: Future]
Hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemars-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since

[Verse 2: Future]
Racks by the ton, I call up Serena
I go tremendo for new fettuccine
All fact though, carat the pinky
All fact though, we ordered the Fiji
I'm in the loop with the voo, I'm in the loop with the woo, which one you workin'?
I'll put your face on the news, I'll put the pussy on the shirt after I murk it
Then make 'em go shoot up the hearse, cost me a quarter bird, nigga, it's worth it
And you a maniac, a fuckin' alien, how you splurgin'?
Got that kitty cat, I'm havin' fun with that, goin' Birkin

[Chorus: Future]
Yeah, hunnid thousand for the cheapest ring on a nigga finger, lil' bitch, woo
I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemars-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo

Oh, oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh
Oh,  oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
We couldn't turn around 'til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now, but know I ain't too proud
I  couldn't be there even when I tried
You  don't believe it, we do this every time

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed  the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm  waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Verse 2]
Let go, I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I said so, I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

[Bridge]
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go

[Chorus]
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away"

12,2020,Maren Morris,The Bones,"[Verse 1]
We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

[Verse 2]
Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good
[Bridge]
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)

Will blow right over while we stay put

I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know though, you already know though
I walk in the corner with the money, on my finger
She might get it popping, I might wife her for the winter
I already know, already know, nigga roses
All I need is roses

[Chorus]
Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw, this who you wanna be
And I know you won't tell nobody nothing
And I know you won't tell nobody no

[Verse 2]
Roses
I might pull up flexing on these niggas like aerobics
I might tell her girl you cute but balling
That shit gorgeous
Standing on the table, Rosé, Rosé, fuck the waters
You know who the god is

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on
Too fast, never ask, if the life don't last
Done been through it all
Fuck with a nigga raw

[Verse 3]
I might bring them Brooklyn niggas out, oh lord it's overs
I might bring them strippers out and tell 'em do it pole-less
You already know, already know, nigga roses
Kill 'em, make it ...

Turn up baby, turn up, when I turn it on
You know how I get too lit when I turn it on
Can't handle my behavior when I turn it on

Being stuck with you, stuck with you, stuck with you

You, oh, oh

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

[Chorus]
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

[Verse 2]
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone

That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night

I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Hanging on to a girl to just rub it in

Forgive and just about forget
Let him take you on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

19,2020,Luke Combs Featuring Eric Church,Does To Me,"[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me"

Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya

My last made me feel like I would never try again

But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down"

Questi ragazzi tutti miei figli come Phoenix (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
La mia città e il mio stato non hanno mai visto questo
Jimmy Neutron, sono un ragazzo prodigio (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
Sul futon, le sto dando quel cazzo
Quando questa merda è pronta, I'ma fill up arenas
Ooh, come Gilbert Arenas, sparo il colpo
Sono ancora con i demoni, ooh, I keep it thorough
Ho cinque tipe a New York
Questo significa una in ogni quartiere
Sono nel pocket come Burrow
Quando sono tornato a casa, though
Mi trattano come Robert De Niro
La ho portata Taco Bell, le ho comprato un churro
La ho portata a casa, le ho dato un cinnamon swirl
I left it in, now I got a one-year old
Zeri su zeri su zeri (Zeri)
Quello è cosa il bilancio del mio conto bancario dice (Woo)
Ho a check dalla compagnia di scarpe
Ora faccio qualsiasi cosa che dice New Balance
Le ho comprato un biglietto aereo, fuori di stato
I got me a shorty from 'round the way
Ho detto, ""Sono in città oggi""
Lei ha detto che she comin' over and she down to stay
I got a hit, she been playin' quella merda
Così quando she pull up on me so cosa she 'bout to say

I go back and forth come se giocassi a tennis
Fotto con la tua puttana, yeah, I'm fit for it

I fucked her, she told me, ""It's nobody harder""
And I'm with the G-ski, I need that shit for the freeski

She use to lie on my bed and go lie to your face
And say I'm just a broski, nigga, you knows me
You ain't believe it, you wanted to toast me
I had extendi as long as a ruler in case you was coolin' and wanna approach me
Dropped the Bentayga, came back in the Cullinan
She wanna fuck again, I want that tongue again
Stuck it so deep that she cough up her lung again
Five star bitches, they on the run again, run again
Runnin' in diamonds, they illuminatin' the way that I come again
I just put so many pennies on the watch
That I don't ever got to stunt again, nigga, lil' Tory

25,2020,Powfu Featuring beabadoobee,Death Bed,"Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away
I been thinking of our future 'cause I'll never see those days
I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best, but you know that I'm not perfect
I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Yeah, ayy, ayy)
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed (Ayy, yeah)
I'm happy that you here with me, I'm sorry if I tear up
When me and you were younger, you would always make me cheer up
Taking goofy videos and walking through the park
You would jump into my arms every time you heard a bark
Cuddle in your sheets, sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03
Sundays, went to church, on mondays, watched a movie
Soon you'll be alone, sorry that you have to lose me
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed
Don't stay awake for too long, don't go to bed
I'll make a cup of coffee for your head
It'll get you up and going out of bed"

28,2020,Carly Pearce & Lee Brice,I Hope You're Happy Now,"[Verse 1: Carly Pearce with Lee Brice]
It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said ""I don't love you"" a little too late
But I guess there ain't ever a right time
And I don't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

[Verse 2: Lee Brice with Carly Pearce]
Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

[Chorus: Lee Brice & Carly Pearce, Lee Brice]
Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now
[Chorus: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Carly Pearce]
I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
So I hope you're happy now

[Outro: Carly Pearce & Lee Brice, Lee Brice]
Happy now
Oh, I hope you're happy now
Mmm"
29,2020,Lewis Capaldi,Before You Go,"[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face
[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go"

Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, ""No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it""
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot

I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Good girl, good girl)

I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you

[Chorus]
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
[Verse 2]
I tried to find love
In someone else too many times
But I hope you know I mean it (Mean it)
When I tell you you're the one that was on my mind, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know (Let you know)

32,2020,Travis Denning,After A Few,"[Verse 1]
I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss
[Pre Chorus]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few"
33,2020,Dua Lipa,Break My Heart,"[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""

34,2020,Billie Eilish,Everything I Wanted,"[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

There stands the glass
That will ease all my pain
That will settle my brain
It's my first one today
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I saw your sister at work
I saw your mama at church
I'm pretty sure I saw your car at the mall
I see your face in the clouds
I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

[Pre-Chorus]
It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget
[Verse 2]
Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Bridge]
There stands the glass
That-that will ease all my pain
That-that will settle my brain
It's-it's my first one today
[Chorus]
You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

[Outro]
Oh honey, I'm fallin' apart
And you're playin' hard to forget"
37,2020,Gunna Featuring Young Thug,Dollaz On My Head,"[Intro: Gunna]
Pull up with a stick, I pull up with a stick (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick (Ear Drummers)
I put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich
We was used to pullin' kick doors (That money go for Myles)

[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

[Verse 1: Gunna]
My bro on a steamin' stove, cookin' crack like grits
Got this vibe on her tippy toes, strokin' her in a pent'
LA live, I'm stayin' at the Loews with this Hollywood bitch
Got a nine and a snubnose (Let's go), can't wait to let it hit (Hit)
Pull up with a stick, I'll pull up with a stick
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick
I'll put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich (Let that ho know that I'm rich)
We was used to pullin' kick doors, you could still call it a lick (Lick)
You broke and can't be fixed (Nah), went to Neimans and spent a nick (Hah)
How you poor? That don't make sense (Ah), I made a whole mile off an inch (An inch)
I had ninety-nine problems, I just scratched your ho off the list (Scratched your ho off the list)
Got some millions and went and solved 'em, now my neck cost a quarter brick (Brick)
[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Bestie, bestie, I just hit my friend
Told her ""Catch me"" (Woah), ""Catch me"" (Woah), I'ma lick her skin
She so precious, precious, might not fuck again
She too messy, messy, but hittin', no flexin' (No flexin')
Rose gold ornaments (Rose)
Dropped the two tint, car came with no tint (Damn)
You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers and a thottie in the bed (Yeah)
I know niggas ran up a milli', still didn't tell 12 shit (12, 12, 12, shh)
I got skeletons in my closets (Woah), and they scared of me and shit (Closets and they scared)
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', ""Rock me, kid"" (Woah)
I put water on my head, then she got seasick (I put water on my head)
Couple opps played dead (What?), and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid (Still ain't my kid)
Only reason I answer my line (Why?), is 'cause she drink my spit (No cap)
[Chorus: Gunna]
I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said

38,2020,Marshmello & Halsey,Be Kind,"[Verse 1]
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That you don't have a bad bone in your body
But the bruises on your ego make you go wild, wild, wild, yeah
Wanna believe, wanna believe
That even when you're stone cold, you're sorry
Tell me why you gotta be so outta your mind, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah

[Verse 2]
I know you need, I know you need
The upper hand even when we aren't fighting
'Cause in the past, you had to prepare every time, yeah
Don't wanna leave, don't wanna leave
But if you're gonna fight, then do it for me
I know you're built to love, but broken down, so just try, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you're chokin' on your fears
Already told you I'm right here
I will stay by your side every night

[Chorus]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah

[Bridge]
I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
Going sick in the head, tryna get you there
And I know it's hard for you, but it's not fair
It's not fair

[Chorus]
I don't know why you hide from the one
And close your eyes to the one
Mess up and lie to the one that you love
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah, ah
When you know you can cry to the one
Always confide in the one
You can be kind to the one that you love
Ah"
39,2020,Thomas Rhett Featuring Jon Pardi,Beer Can't Fix,"[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

[Verse 2: Jon Pardi]
You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair
[Pre-Chorus: Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

[Chorus: Jon Pardi]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Jon Pardi]
It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Jon Pardi & Both]
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix"

Got five bitches rollin' off the dope at the penthouse
She ain't tryna give me no neck, she had to get out
Send my young shooters, go wet some shit
Big brother taught me how to sip Actavis
When I pull up Mulsanne, she get crackin' on the dick

Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Verse 1]
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
This that throw up in your Birkin bag
Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

[Pre-Chorus]
That college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman
[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Verse 2]
This that hot girl bummer two-step
They can't box me in, I'm too left
This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, ""Who's all there?""
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

[Pre-Chorus]
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman
[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum

[Bridge]
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
We go stupid, we go stupid, we go—
And you want me to change? Fuck you!

[Chorus]
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
I'm through, I'm through, I'm through
This that hot girl bummer anthem
Turn it up and throw a tantrum
Fuck you, and you, and you
I hate your friends and they hate me too
Fuck you, and you, and you

Biliyorum işleri berbat ettim, sadece ezik biriyim
Seninle olmamalıyım, sanırım ben bir döneğim
Sen dışarıda içerken, ben burda düşünüyorum
Nerede olmam gerektiğini
Yalnızdım

[Verse 1: BENEE]
Tavandan sular damlıyor
Bunun olacağını biliyordum, inanması yine de zor
Belki dramatik biriyim, öyle görünmek istemiyorum
Panik olmak istemiyorum

[Pre-Chorus: BENEE]
Ben üzgün bir kızım, bu koca dünyada
Bu delirmiş bir dünya
Bütün arkadaşlarım neler olduğunu biliyor
Sen kötü bir detaysın

[Chorus: BENEE]
Biliyorum işleri berbat ettim, sadece ezik biriyim
Seninle olmamalıyım, sanırım ben bir döneğim
Sen dışarıda içerken, ben burda düşünüyorum

[Verse 2: BENEE & Gus Dapperton]
Şu an küvette ağlıyorum
Sanırım yavaş yavaş batıyorum, gözlerimde köpükler var
Belki de sadece rüya görüyorum
Artık üzgünler kulübündeyim, sırt masajı yapmaya çalış

Ben üzgün bir kızım, bu koca dünyada
Bu delirmiş bir dünya

Yalnız (Ben yalnız bir sürtüğüm)
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Yalnız (süper yalnız)
[Bridge: Gus Dapperton]
Romantizmin kendisinden tiksiniyorum, denersem lanetlenirim
Kendi başıma dans ediyorum, İrlanda viskimi tokuşturmayacağım
Yenilenen bardaklar, B-B-Benee bunu yeterince vurgulamıyorum
İşleri batırmaktan nefret ederim
Ama boogie’m hala yerinde duramıyor, evet

[Chorus: BENEE & Gus Dapperton, BENEE]
Biliyorum işleri berbat ettim, sadece ezik biriyim
Seninle olmamalıyım, sanırım ben bir döneğim
Sen dışarıda içerken, ben burda düşünüyorum

Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)
Selling dope 'til the sun come down (Come down)

Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (With my Glock)
You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (Get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

[Verse 1: NLE Choppa]
Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom (You fucked, yeah)
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy (I smoke 'em up, yeah)
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em (I wanna)
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em (I gotta stalk 'em)
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em (Grrt, grrt)
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em (Yeah)

Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Sippin' on a frozen drink

Clouds ain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
""Hey, señorita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?""
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

[Verse 2]
Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock

1300 block, bitch, I caught my last cases there
Ain't no second chances in this shit, so we can't play it fair
Foenem line shit like a barber, Glock knock off his facial hair
Caught him lackin' in his whip, they tryna find his face in there
Lil Hop Out, he stay on go, bitch, all he know is green light
Let off shots with accuracy, showed 'em what that beam like
Posted by that liquor store, was sellin' what the fiends like
Used to wake up in low income, now I live a dream life

Don't come 'round here like we friends, you know I don't know you
You know I got demons, allow me to show you
Lately, I been on the road (Yeah), show after show

[Verse 2]
Wake up every day, somebody harrassin' me
I got rich, they need money, they askin' me
I was sittin' in jail, they ain't look out for me
Ones who need me them same ones who doubted me
I been handlin' my own, they can vouch for me
Head way down with me, know that she proud of me
Turn the heat up, ain't nobody hot as me
Everywhere dollars be, that's how I gotta be
I done gave her the world, now she not leavin'
Say she love me to death, told her, ""Stop breathin'""
He try do what I do, but we not even
I want all of the beef, I am not vegan
Boy, you said it was smoke, nigga, stop speakin'
'Ventador, drop the top, I can't stop speedin'
Tryna see if this bitch hit the top speed
Hit the bitch from the back, have her knock knee
Call me Baby Hov, I control the rock
If the rap slow, I control the block
Yeah, I'm really it, and you niggas not
Got a couple coupes, I can drop the top
I done made it, nigga, all these digits comin' in
I'm savin' for the bigger picture, know one day I'll need 'em
Might as well get used to me
My biggest fear is endin' up a used-to-be, yeah
[Chorus]
Yeah, my diamonds be VV's (VV's)
They don't wan' see us on TV unless it's the news
I got somethin' to prove (Somethin' to prove)
Yeah, I'm young, but got somethin' to lose (Somethin' to lose)
In the street, I done paid all my dues (Yeah)
No extortion, ain't talking 'bout literally (Nah)

I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34  was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,  I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep

They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I  got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

[Chorus]
And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul

53,2020,Lil Baby,Emotionally Scarred,"[Verse 1]
A love letter came through the mail, it said, ""I miss you""
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, ""Of course""
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

[Verse 2]
All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it
[Chorus]
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)

I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

Top floor (Yeah)
Elevator entrance, not doors
Only thing above us is outdoors
Took her down to Houston to the chachos
Took a million and started a bank
Top of the floor, man, it came with the rank
And you're welcome come party, the hell did you think?
Juggle the beats how I juggle the fame
And I gobble the pain when I swallow this drank
I grow my own gas in the back of the farm
Need the cover of Time so my haters believers
I ran through these seasons with centerfold pieces
Flip the promoter just like we do pizza
Just run me my cheese, we don't wanna go grease ya

[Coro: GIVĒON]
A las 2:30, cariño, ¿nos reuniremos en The Bean?
Si es muy temprano, tal vez más tarde podrías mostrarme algunas cosas
Sabes a lo que me refiero, cada vez que visito
La ciudad Windy, ella me da besos, no
Con treinta grados hace demasiado frío, así que abrázame fuerte
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?

[Verso 1: Drake]
Ey, del camión al avión, al camión
Del camión al pasillo del hotel
Yo paseo por garajes subterráneos
Con un suite presidencial en el depósito
Y un ascensor hasta la habitación
Nos duchamos y luego vamos al club
Llego y tengo que ver qué ocurre
Con el código de área de mi teléfono
¿Qué números sigo teniendo?
¿A quién conozco del pasado?
Hablo con una, y ella dice que tiene un hombre
Hablo con otra, aparece verde
Debe haber cambiado de teléfono al equipo
¿Recuerdas cuando me llevabas por el buen camino?
Eso fue en 2017
Todo está bien, Chubbs mirará alrededor
Encuentra a alguien que sea de mi tipo
Ese es mi socio y él sabe lo que me gusta
Él encontró mucho en mi vida
El problema es que me veré con una chica esta noche
Y la trataré demasiado bien
Pasos de tarjetas de crédito en el Galleria
Sin siquiera saber si está casada
[Pre-Coro: Drake]
Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista
De un solo camino

[Coro: GIVĒON]
A las 2:30, cariño, ¿nos reuniremos en The Bean?
Si es muy temprano, tal vez más tarde podrías mostrarme algunas cosas
Sabes a lo que me refiero, cada vez que visito
La ciudad Windy, ella me da besos, no
Con treinta grados hace demasiado frío, así que abrázame fuerte
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?

[Verso 2: Drake]
Hay joyas en la caja fuerte a la llegada
J lleva una pistola para sobrevivir
Mucha gente lucha por el título
Mucha gente trata de aprovecharse
Pero yo sólo estoy tratando de pasar una buena noche
El camarero trajo el cheque de la comida
Ella dijo, ""Cariño, creo que hubo un error""
No, chica, yo lo pago, no es nada
Podría mostrarte cosas más grandes que eso
En un minuto regreso
Déjame mostrarte imágenes que sí duran
AMEX tenía un límite en el pasado
Tuve muchas mujeres en el pasado
Pequé mucho en el pasado
No necesitas saberlo, pero puedes preguntar
Apegada a tu pase tras bastidores
Tienes todo el acceso porque eres mala
Podrías ir a donde sea con ese culo
Del concierto a la ducha, al camión
Del camión al club, para la fiesta
Entras primero con tus amigas
Porque no sé quién está afuera mirando
[Pre-Coro: Drake]
Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista
De un solo camino

You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

Sipped a little shine from a paper sack that'll
Knock the horns off a Cadillac

Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat

Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

69,2020,Gunna,Met Gala,"[Intro]
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
I drip on this bitch like Met Gala, ballin'
Answer her texts, don't answer her calls

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

[Verse 1]
Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came
That boy say my name, I went and got me some strain
You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame
I trapped for a living and been had a name
Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, and ain't easy to tame
She squirt on my sheets while I beat out her frame
Dozed off, woke back up, she still sayin' my name
In love with my life, and you wish we could trade
[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

[Verse 2]
Walk in with the drip like Met Gala Ball
Came in and she strip, her panties and all
Lip gloss on her lip, suck me like a Hall
A boss and a pimp, I bought me a ship
I walk with a limp, FN in my drawers
When she talk that shit, I put dick in her jaws
I hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat
On the South, in that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'? Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard
I ain't get this shit just from askin', I made this shit happen and passion, it played a big part
I ain't get this bitch off of mackin', it came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

[Chorus]
Yeah, she sent me a text, won't answer her call
She love when I flex and shop in the mall
Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls
We speed in that 'Vette, don't stop for the laws
VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball"

I didn't feel it when the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)

Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies

Hey, hey
Oh, cover me in daisies

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out (Count me out)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house

79,2020,Keith Urban,God Whispered Your Name,"[Verse 1]
I was so cold and lost
And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For everything I'd been through
And each day, I knew I needed change
But there was no way, no way

[Chorus]
And then God whispered your name
And that's when everything changed
And love came out of the rain
And talk about being saved
Suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Verse 2]
I can see the sunshine
For the first time in a while
Girl, it's like I've been baptized
By the warmth of your smile, hmm
Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace
[Chorus]
When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain
Talk about being saved
Well, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name

[Bridge]
It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear

When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain (Out of the rain)

When God whispered your name, oh yeah

40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans

Disappear kick back on a white sand beach

A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand

When they let us off of lock', man, we gon' make that shit pop
Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)

I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken

Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em

Won't be your one and only

Consider it to cross me a costly mistake

In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw

'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her

'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full
I'm not afraid to pull a—

[Verse 1: NAV]
I'm a late bloomer, third year on the scene
Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me
Came from the streets, it turned me to a beast
Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload
I fuck the bitch I picked right out of Vogue

[Chorus: NAV]
Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

Who is that lil' nigga icy hoppin' out a Wraith? (Hoppin' out a Wraith?)
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade (Chop)
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page (Poppin' on your page)
Trust me, we could never be the same (Never be the same)
You know I like to flirt, no skirts in Turks (Yeah)
I'm puttin' in work, I beat her out the frame (Beat her out the frame, Wheezy outta here)
She sweet, I was movin' off a Perc'
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake (Birthday cake)
Line his ass up like a barber do the fade (Barber do the fade)
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes

[Verse 1: Polo G & Stunna 4 Vegas]
Hit the strip after school, couldn't wait 'til I got out of class, used to stare at the clock and shit
Before all of this rappin' shit, I was gangbangin' and doin' high-speeds on the cops and shit
And I'm straight from the Chi, but I ball like a king up in Cali and shoot like Stojaković
Keep applyin' that pressure, I go on the run, it ain't no lettin' it up, ain't no stoppin' this
Had to tell my lil' brother to chill, gotta stay in the house, come outside, he be poppin' shit
You ain't heard about us, well, you need to go watch the news, niggas know we be dropping shit
Got the feds on my ass in the hood 'cause they think I'm the one who been buyin' up Glocks and shit
I'm just focused on music, they say my last tape was a classic, but I got some hotter shit (Hotter shit)
Might be rocking a show or if I'm not up the stu', then I'm fucking this cash off
Don't you know Polo G? Skinny tall with the dreads, that lil' nigga be rappin' his ass off
Yeah, I heard she got surgery, still wanna clap from the back just to see if her ass soft
Go like Harden with rockets, we blast off
Tried to throw us some bullets, but we made 'em fumble, like nah, you ain't gettin' that pass off
Spin the block, now I'm takin' my mask off
Hit the gas like we racin', speed off in them foreigns and leave tire marks on the asphalt
It's gon' be R.I.P. once your ass caught
He like frontin', we knockin' his cap off
'Nother day, a new chain or a MAC bought
All this ice got me freezin' like Jack Frost (4X)

In BOA, I'm pullin' them bands out (Cash)
DOA, bitch, I get your mans off (Gone)
A rockstar from the block, I stand out (Uh)
Came from nothing, I fucked my advance off
When I hit the game, with my flow, niggas ran off (No cap), fuck it
I'm not your average joe (Uh-uh)
When I leave the house, I tuck it, uh (Fire, fire)
I'm rich, I don't shop on no budget
He clutchin', my lil' youngin want him a bucket, uh (Score)
I hop on this bitch and run it (Uh)
If I said it, I seen it or done it (Uh, uh)
These lil' niggas never robbed nobody
Ain't caught no body, and ain't getting no money (Cap)
Where I'm from, it's sports or gunplay
We looked up to the killer and dealers
But even them niggas wan' make it out one day (On gang)
Fuck my first M, I been had hood fame (Yeah)
Took off like I was on a runway (Yoom)

Hop on the scene and I'm thuggin'
This Glock on my hip, so you know that I'm clutchin'
Catch me an opp, I'ma down him in public
The police keep askin', I'm changin' the subject
The way I grew up, man, a nigga was rugged
Why the fuck you got a gun? You not gonna bust it
And a hundred some shots, I ain't doin' no tustlin'
Give a nigga temptation like he David Ruffin
I ain't gon' cap, I don't even like rappin'
But I love wrappin' them bodies and shit
Fuck the bitch, and when I get done
I'ma up my Glock and then rob the bitch
Catch a nigga when he clock out
I'ma get him whacked at his job and shit
And I don't know why the police keep fuckin' with me
'Cause they ain't stoppin' shit, yeah
Spin on your block like a remix
Shoot him in the face, get his teeth lit
Extended clip like a broomstick
Shoot a flick like Netflix
Scratch an opp off the checklist
I just bought a gun off Craigslist
Shoot an opp in the brain, I'm leavin' a stain, only thing you see is red shit
If the police behind, we keep duckin'
My gun need some drawers, it got nuts
Whole gang, we strapped, don't test us
If a nigga play, he gon' get bust, yeah

She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's her head lost
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mum, while you diddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get bun, where I'm from, it's on

See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top

'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up

Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map

Dysfunctional, I can't show affection, might bug out for no reason
Really you don't even gotta be here, I done got so used to people leavin'

Ask around, I bet they tell you we winnin'

Run it up and show love to my city

Even on your worst days, girl, you still kind of cute
If it go down, I'm gon' protect you, pull that stick out and shoot
All I want is your love, I can't see no bitch after you
Off emotions, we did things that we didn't have to do
Scared of you leaving, I told lies when you asked for the truth
I second-guessed if you the one, that's when I didn't have a clue
They be Martin and Gina, but we ain't think about behind the scenes
The way I kill it, lose her voice when she tryin' to scream
We from the trenches, we moved onto the finer things
Now you done went from H&M to a designer fiend

You can only get this feeling from a thug

Only talk to bosses, independent, can't be fucking with a scrub

I get this feeling in my stomach when you next to me
Man, I'm tryna get to know you sexually
Take you on shopping sprees for therapy
Move you out to Cali', in my mansion takin' care of me

Beauty and the beast, pretty girl with a gangster
I swear you still the baddest in the room with no makeup
You the type of woman every hood nigga pray for
I vow to stay a hundred, never change up
In that sundress, damn, your body so amazing
Love the way you smell, I'm addicted to your fragrance
It's somethin' about you, but I really can't explain it
Just know that you mine, I tell that nigga he can save it

Ever since I stepped up in this game, I've been a bomb threat
I was in the trenches, tryna see a life beyond that
'Cause complacent niggas usually die up in they complex

Lil' bitch, I'm from the Northside where they raise goons
Took losses in these streets, shit got me singin' gang blues

Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Baby]
Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down
I don't trust no one, I can't put my gun down
Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name (Hello?)
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

[Verse 4: 42 Dugg]
Bitches ain't shit, doggybone, I get it
Fell in love twice, had me in my feelings
Three months, dropped damn near a half a million
Nigga, fuck a house, I done damn lost a building
Fucked a nigga's ho, so he say he wanna kill me
I miss Tev, this shit was different
I miss Nef, rest in peace to my niggas
Damn near went deaf, when they told me they killed you
Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on
Still'll flood a nigga town with a truckload
Get the head, I'm out, I don't trust hoes
If the feds in the house, a nigga told on me
I pray to God my soul to keep
G5 just beat his murder
Body got picked up, doggy I'm hurt
Still pay the lawyer even though I'm nervous
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang

Never thought 'bout doin' music
I was tryna build my phone up
Contacts full of drug abusers
Ridin' around with that Mexican, tryna figure out what my cousin doin'
Prison with the 'migos, found out they was sellin' bricks
Wish I would've knew that shit, I would've been lit
Swear to God, since I was seventeen, I been hood rich
I be at James Harden house, I'm all in Houston in the mix
I'm talkin' 'bout spare time in New York, I buy floor seats to watch the Knicks
And I don't even know no players

I might just stand up and go crazy, someone make the layup
And we ain't squashin' shit for free, you niggas gotta pay us
You niggas better pay up, yeah
Know he might not beat it, I told the lawyer go for a lighter sentence
I don't want know no problems with y'all niggas, y'all got women tendencies
I don't gotta sell drugs no more, I'm bossed up, I got plenty business
Ridin' 'round in that Lam' truck, I wreck this bitch, it ain't rented
Givin' out my respect, get respect in every city
Niggas know I came up, but I came back through the slums with Diddy
Fucked around and got plugged in, I'm buyin' that red Richard Mille
Stay out my lil' brother business, just know that they gettin' millions

Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Good for you

Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused

Und ich sage, oh (Ohh)
Die Art, wie ich dich einatme (Ein-)
Es ist die Textur deiner Haut
Ich möchte meine Arme um dich legen, Baby
Lasse dich niemals gehen, oh

Es gibt nichts, das wie deine Berührung ist
Es ist die Art, wie du mich aufbaust
Ja, und ich werde bei dir sein bis zum Ende der Zeit

Aber ich bin es für dich
Alles, was ich wollen könnte, alles, was ich mir wünschen könnte

Es gibt keine Zeit mehr, ich möchte mehr Zeit haben
Und dir mein ganzes Leben geben

Hasse es, sie zu verlassen, nenn es Folter
Erinnere mich zurück, wie ich sie nicht halten könnte
Habe ihr das Gepäck für Rimowa zurückgelassen

Hand in meiner Hand, weil ich deins bin (Ich kann nicht)
Ich kann es nicht vortäuschen, ich kann es nicht ignorieren, du bist richtig für mich
Denk nicht, du würdest willst wissen wollen, wo ich war, ohh

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about

That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help

And I wish people liked me more

If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2]
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someonе more exciting
The nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied

'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied

And don't you think I loved you too much
To be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much
To think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday, I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
Then you'll be the one who's crying

Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy

Say you love her, baby
Just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Shit, I guess that's how it sound when you winnin'
I ain't jokin', do it sound like I'm kiddin'?

Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri

Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely

White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand"
119,2021,Luke Combs,Forever After All,"[Verse 1]
A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

[Pre-Chorus]
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Verse 2]
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back, I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)

Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)

A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today

I guess way too late is convenient for you (Ooh)
The dirt you left don't turn into dust, it don't move (Ooh)
It's here waiting for you (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
She run from all of her problems like she in shape for it (Oh)
Hard times, wait for it and then she break for it (And then she break, yeah)
Love don't cost a thing, ashamed how much I paid for it (I'm ashamed)
Love don't cost a thing ashamed how much I gave for it
Heart broken into pieces put tape on it (Woah-woah)
Fragile made out of glass, close the drapes on it (Woah-woah)
Trust issues so deep playing safe on it (Woah-woah)
Will I ever love again or will I stay lonely?
[Refrain]
I-I-I-I-I I'm
Lost for words, let it hurt
(Setting my heart on fire, setting my heart on fire)
I-I-I-I-I
Put you first, showed you your worth
(Gave you whatever you desire, gave you whatever you desire)

So used to them gray clouds, I might fuck around, drop the top in the rain
For the squad, we don't play around, we'll lay him down, hit his top close range
He just pretend, he not with the gang

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Lil Baby & Lil Durk]
Scratched a million off my checklist three years ago
Add two zeros to the one, I'm in a different mode
This my life, do what I want, I be with different hoes
You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people
I said, ""I’m the one,"" they didn't believe me
I show 'em the facts, now they all need me
I'ma get cake as long as I'm breathin'
They makin' it hard, this shit really easy, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)

[Verse 2: Lil Baby, DJ Khaled & Lil Durk]
Yeah, she think I'm a regular rapper, I'm not
One person come tell me, we fuck up your block
Watch me run this shit to the tippity-top, yeah (Keep goin')
Put my kids in Givenchy
She must think one plus one is three
I can't support you personally
She don't got a mortgage, moved in with her niece
These niggas be cappin', them cars be leased
Youngest in charge, I speak for the streets
I was nodding off, they woke up a beast
Struggle what made me, we used to have water for dinner, we didn't have nothin' to eat
Soon as I get on his ass, they gon' look at me better, like, ""Damn, he was fuckin' with me,"" yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks
Soon as they say we can't come, you know we'll run 'round that bitch
You can miss me with that shit, you know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
You know I live in the mix (Money, cars and clothes and hoes)
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
I'm from the trenches
Niggas be tough on the 'net, but really be there for attention
Bitches be talkin' like they really rich
But really be beggin' me under my pictures
I'll give her forty, fifty thousand cash to start up a business
I'll spend that shit at the dentist
I'd rather fuck her and pay up her rent for a year just to get out of her feelings
I'm in the Lambo' truck in my hood, nobody gon' tell me shit
Goin' to Cali, I pick up my weed for sure, nobody gon' mail me shit
Dice game, Craps and Cee-Lo, I need cash, don't sell me shit
Baby got his hood on smash, yeah, you can tell they really rich
Drop the load, ain't no room right now, I took her to the O
Then I pulled up on the Lamb' 'cause she a fan of Boonie Moe
I got the city on lock, uh, fuckin' up all the opps
I be around with three million dollars in jewelry, I'm standin' on all the blocks
This the anthem, mmm-hmm
Droppin' the six in the Fanta, mmm
Black Rolls truck with the all-white seats, remind me of sittin' on Panda, mmm
I love my cousin, she was a dancer
I love my brother, he was a scammer
Sittin' on my lap 'cause I'm pullin' her tracks and I fuck from the back 'cause she callin' me handsome (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
I'ma turn up on a hater every chance that I get
I want the biggest watch that they got, don't care if that shit hurt my wrist
All these hoes fuck on us all, I wish I would claim that bitch
They get hard when they get guns, we got a hood full of sticks

Yeah, I kinda put the cup down for a minute but umm
But honestly, it ain't nobody's business what's in my cup, what's in your cup, what's in they cup
It's your cup, drink it
So whatever the hell was in my cup, the only reaction I did was got more popular, more successful
Than a lot more things that I've ever done, I probably should pick that cup back up (Haha)

[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' here lookin' at Keisha, like, ""Do you love me, do you love me not?""
Damn, you hit the spot
Taste like candy (Candy), sweet like fruit (Ooh)
Wet like water, can I love on you?
Withdrawals, I'm feelin' different, every day I need a dose
Every now and thеn I'm missin', I got my times when I go ghost
But she minе (Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm), I'm stampin' her
Priority status, so them other bitches mad at her (Too mad, ha)
Thumbin' through a hunnid thou', I spent that times two on you
Caught myself cuttin' you loose, then I pop back up like peekaboo
Here I go, flyer than most, Louis V coat
Gas station, coffee cup full, I don't drive boats, no
Money can't buy happiness but she found love inside a G
Head and somethin' to eat, that's all a thug nigga need
No lie you get me higher than the prices on my weed
I'm displayin' my feelings like I'm wearing 'em on my sleeve (See)

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

[Verse 2]
Ring around the rose-z, cup full of OZ's
I hope I don't OD, she keep sayin', ""Pour me""
Turn me to that purple demon emoji (Devil)
Fuck me like you miss me, it's been a whole week
This ain't no playground love, we grown (Too grown)
I'm too fucked up, I paid four hunnid for a zone (That strong)
My bitch don't like you, you've been fuckin' up my home (In my house)
Relapsin' every time I try to leave you 'lone (I relapse, girl)
Every nigga in the street lookin' for her but she rare
Dark skin, purple hair, stingy, with her hard to share (I can't)
Never needed nobody but it feel good to have somebody (That somebody)
Drop you and pick you up whenever I feel like it
This shit toxic
Let me know if you feel me, hmm-hmm (Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm)
I gotta stop it, I must stop it

[Pre-Chorus]
One minute I'm done with you, the next one I be runnin' back
Go your way, I go my way but somehow we be still attached
Tryna find my answers with this cup, but ain't no truth in that
They be like, I'm dumb for fuckin' with you, I spend stupid racks
[Chorus]
I'm sittin' here knowing I don't need ya pouring O's in the lid
Sippin' chaser with my reefer, can't get my mind off Wockesha
Watch me put my heart in this cup
In my feelings, she my therapist, I'ma talk to this cup (I swear)

Don't stop, baby, you can walk through
Don't want, baby, think about you

Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat, heat waves, I'm swimmin' in a—

Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 1]
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood, layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now, the night has come, but
[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

[Verse 2]
You can't fight it, you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
[Bridge]
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out

[Chorus]
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes, all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now

I was no daddy's dream
Was not your momma's prayer
But I was your first and your
Last ticket out of there
I caught your wings on fire
When I smoked my bronco tires
Out of that town

[Verse 2]
I'm good at rollin' dice
No good at standin' still
You liked the thought of chasin'
Life instead of dollar bills
We were livin' wreckless
Nothin' to catch us, baby
But the ground

[Chorus]
This ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me, holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
[Verse 3]
I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shootin' stars
Chasin' what's in our hearts
Into thе blue (Into the blue)

[Chorus]
This ain't for еverybody
Toes hangin' off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a Hell of a view
A Hell of a view

We ain't for everybody
Toes hangin' off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always Heaven, baby

It's a Hell of a view

He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

[Pre-Chorus]
One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Verse 2]
You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
[Pre-Chorus]
He's one of the good ones

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

[Bridge]
We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

[Chorus]
A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine"

And she take a naked pic before she leave the door
I be waking up to pics before a nigga yawning
And every weekend my shawty comin' over (Over)
Shawty could Fendi out but she like Fashion Nova (Nova)
She ain't driving no Camry she pullin' in a Rover (Rover)
With her hair so curly, I love you, baby

[Chorus]
She said, ""What you know 'bout love?"" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please

It's just you and me
You know what I be on, I'm about to go raw (Love you, baby)
'Cause I like what I see

[Verse 2]
Look, baby, I said I ain't gon' front
You got my heart beating so fast to words I can't pronounce
And I be getting the chills every time I feel your touch
I be looking at the top and girl, it's only us
All I need is your trust
And girl I told you once, don't make me tell you twice
I know you see this print through my pants that I know you like
And yo ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights
And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
You always keep me right, for a fact, you never left
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best
So here's fifty-five hunnid, go and get your breasts
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo neck
Hey batter, batter, hey batter, batter
Niggas know I had to swing, I had to make a play
I had to apply the pressure, 'cause you my hidden treasure
I think I'm falling in love
[Chorus]
She said, ""What you know 'bout love?"" (I'll tell you everything)
I got what you need (Oh)
Walk up in the store and get what you want (Go get it)
You get what you please

It's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Verse 2]
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared (Oh, scared)
Learnin' to be grateful for myself (Oh, oh, oh)
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me (Trust me)
The way that you trust me (Trust me)
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view

[Bridge]
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely (My baggage fadin')
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away

[Chorus]
I wanna love me (Ooh)
The way that you love me (Ooh)
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh (Trust me)
The way that you trust me, baby (Trust me)

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Drake]
Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life
Amen

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I'm from the four, but I love me a threesome
DM her, delete it, she my lil' secret
He tryna diss me to blow up, I peep it
I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto
I know I be on some shit that they ain't thought of
[Chorus: Drake]
Sins, I got sins on my mind
And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
I'm in love, I'm in love with two girls at one time
And they tens, that's why I got ten on my mind
I got M's, got a lot of M's on my mind
And my friends, yeah, I keep my friends on my mind
Should repent, I need me some Jesus in my life

Yeah, man, oh man, oh man

[Verse 1]
Bartender looked at me like
""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again
It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
[Verse 2]
Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

[Chorus]
I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

[Bridge]
Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life
[Chorus]
Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
(I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s)
I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Bae gave it to me (Hmm)
You dig? Yeah, hold up, hm

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I'ma pull up so lit, I just might crash, dawg
Let me take this Balenciaga mask off to ask y'all, ""Who asked y'all?""
Cita told me to stomp my ass off, that's all
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop, he was a good cat, my bad, dawg
Don't put no K after that B-Boy, ""Bad kall,"" that's flag talk
Fuck around and knock your flag off, I had to
I wore a Gat' before a tattoo, I had to
As a matter of fact, I had two
No cap, I'm on them capsules, I done relapsed, boo
But I been on my feet since Cinderella lost her glass shoe
The cash blue, but I'm still seein' green
I'm in the bathroom, and I'm peein' lean
My bitch a vacuum
I told her, ""Keep me clean,"" the scene serene
I'm a badonkadonk and bikini fiend
I just need a queen that ain't scared to fuck a Stephen King
I used to live next door to Drake and Momma Dee
And Lisa Dee on Eagle Street
How I go from bars on the screen door to the TV screen?
Don't ask me, but never change the channel
Gucci flannel, Gucci socks, Gucci sandals
Gucci teddy bears, and pandas, not fake
Propaganda 'bout to blow out the candle
My lil' ho out Atlanta, got a ho out Atlanta
With a ho out Atlanta, she a ho out Atlanta
We get it, it's the same in each city
My bitch dance better than P. Diddy's
And ever since the pandemic
They don't wanna let Drake out of Canada
I been screamin', ""Free Drizzy""
I know bae trust my vision but don't want me to see prison
Said, ""I can't make no promises, either leave or come visit
But leave the keys to your heart next to your soul and your spirit""
Some see graffiti as art, some could see hoes to be women
But I'm the greediest shark amongst an ocean of killers
I put you six feet deep, I'm bein' socially distant
Nina Ross on the hip, the .44 is my mistress
Extra shots, extra clips, ain't talkin' videos nor vixens
Just come and see about it, bitch
Tunechi
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I am the star in any room that I stand in
I am the standout, you just my stand-in
These bitches copy my homework, that's what they hand in
That's why I'm private like the airports I land in
Life is a beach house, don't let the sand in
I ball in any arena, go let the fans in
I should go cop a new jersey, that's word to Camden
These bitches' time tick-tockin', better stick to dancin'
I D&G the wallet, my money tall and brolic
Big-ass backyards, just so Papa Bear can frolic
One Margarita pizza with Parmesan and garlic
These bitches thirsty, I can see why they alcoholics
Ain't gotta ever talk about it when you are about it
Just bought a new car, not to drive it, but to walk around it
Just call me ""Nicki, cock the blicky,"" the Minaj is silent
Brand new vanilla Maserati, I been Häagen-Dazsin'
He call me solid even though I'm drippin', water diet
Big booty stickin' out, my Daisy Dukes'll cause a riot
These bitches still my sons, who could ever deny it?
My packs hit different, who could ever supply it?
No one bitch could be my opp, that shit offends me
It's corporate giants and machines that went against me
I wash bitches, man, they couldn't even rinse me
She said she hot, I said, ""Well, bitch, come and convince me""
Ain't no C in green, but I'm seein' green
Even with them floor seats, they couldn't see the team
The K-I-N-G, the G.O.A.T., plus me, the Queen
I send shots, send 'em back or flee the scene
[Break: Drake]
You know, one of the perils of makin' money is
You can afford to be dramatic
Y'all some drama queens, for real
It's all good, though
You now tuned in to the biggest ever
YMCMB, Tunechi Lee, Young Angel, Young Lion, man
Y'all boys get on a track with Onika Maraj, and y'all still dyin'
Man, what's up? We in this bitch

[Verse 3: Drake]
This ain't gon' be the first time that I do numbers on two crutches
Seen more plaques than toothbrushes
Until I'm at the pearly white gates, I gotta move somethin', do somethin'
All meetings happen in person, so they can't prove nothin'
Known her eight years and still fuck her like a new husband
Tryna run a country like Putin one day, but who's rushin', who's bluffin'? For real
Who you huggin', who you wanna be lovin'?
I play forty-eight minutes on a torn meniscus, who's subbin'?
El Chico luxury, wanna see my niggas ball so bad, I started up a league
Fuck with me, you niggas can't trouble me from the Doubletree
Step your suites up, I get Oliver to set the beats up
2021, I had to wet the streets up
Your girl was better in the mornin' like a slice of pizza
That's when I had to hit her with the, ""Nice to meet ya""
You niggas think you doin' damage, you just hypin' me up
Face who? I could see a wall of y'all, all of y'all and run straight through
Trust, it's all fun and games until I wanna play too
Ayy, dios mío, the ice is frío on the Jesus, it's bringin' me closer to God
I'm already close to the mob, I'm already known as the G.O.A.T
Could try and get close, but you won't, I already packed the garage
None of these shits is a Dodge, none of this shit's a facade
None of this shit's a mirage
Thought I was seein' things when I was seein' green

You can come get rich with us, you gon' eat or you gon' starve?
Keep a certified hitter sittin', I pay him not to rob
Hop out 2020 Cullinan, I'm ridin' in the stars
Know some people hate that I'm on top, I bulletproofed the car
All the members made free bands off packs, live like they crackin' cards
Joe know for a fact I keep it real, he still ain't take the charge
Why she talkin' crazy 'bout me like I don't do more than my part?
I can't play with my creation, give the world to my lil' boys
I been savin' more than I been spendin', that's what I bе on
I'm a human, I'm not perfect, I know sometimеs I be wrong

If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex
[Verse 2]
I told brodie 'nem to park the car, but they still wrecked
I don't think nobody around steal, but I still check
I don't got a hundred mil' yet, I can't chill yet
But don't get it misconstrued, yeah, I get real checks
Baby fuckin' like a pornstar, we have real sex
Have nobody in our business, we take Learjets
Say she like when I perform, so I fuck her with my chains on
And she handlin' her part, so I let her play the main role
Ain't have to get rich for these partners, still with the same folks
And I can't beef with none of you niggas, not in the same boat
I'm never gon' get caught up about it, know how the game go
Tennis chain bustin', look like rainbows

[Chorus]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me
Put six figures in your business, I do real shit
I drop cash at the dealership, they'll mail you a pink slip
She make sure she keep her nails did and her wig fixed
Went to jail and that one held me down, she a real bitch
Hundred rounds in the double drum, this a Kel-Tec
Marco been in prison for a while, but he still flex

[Outro]
I'm like, ""Come and put that pussy on me, don't be runnin' from me""
If I like it, I spend money on it, get whatever from me"

Baby, I see them boys
They always lookin' at you
But I ain’t causin' a scene
'Cause girl, I’m the one that's with you

Try to steal your attention
They can talk a big talk, they can walk a big walk
But I know you ain't going home with 'em

I know how you like your coffee
And how hot you like your bath
I know what makes you angry
And what makes you laugh
I know the taste of your lips, every inch of your skin
The little things that turn you on
I know that look in your eyes when they look back at mine
Saying baby, take me home

Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself

Boss thinks I've been sick for days

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

[Chorus]
I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

[Verse 2]
Took a trip down memory lane
Checked into hotel heartbreak
Passed rock bottom on the way
Without leaving my living room

I've been a million places
But they're all up in my head
Over-drinking, overthinking ever since you left

I've been gone, I've been gone

All day long, I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong

Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone
Yeah, I've been gone

All the clothes are on the floor
All the mail's by the door
All the whiskey bottles in my bed
All the dishes in the sink
All the gas is in the tank
All the neighbors probably think I'm dead

I've been gone, I've been gone
I've been sittin' on the couch watching TV all day long
All day long I've been tryin' to figure out how a good thing went wrong
Faster than that freight train, farther than that airplane
Sadder than a country song
Headed down that highway, anywhere but my way
Ever since you moved on, I've been gone

And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the ""hey, I think we need to talk""
And the ""it ain't me, it's you"" (Oh, it ain't me)

On the weeds that looked like daisies

If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help

Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

Wouldn't be no sad songs

The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience ""H20""98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean ""Don't Play""97. Mac Miller ft.

Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins	ft Joey Bada$$ ""Jerome""93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q ""2 On""92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens ""Better In Tune With The Infinite""91. Big K.R.I.T. ""King Of The South""90. PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86.

His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj.

Theophilus London ft Kanye West ""Can't Stop""81. Future ft. Andre 3000 ""Benz Friends (Whatchutola)""80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft.

Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods	""Sunday Candy""The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.

Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion

One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room

Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release

The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""

Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind."

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange

She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know (Didn't know)
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes (In your clothes)
But now she's got to get to class

Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun

You need an instant ease
From your life where you got plenty
Of every hurt and heartbreak (Oh)
You just take it all to the face
I know that you want to cry
But there's much more to life than dyin'
Over your past mistakes (Oh)
And people who threw dirt on your name

[Verse]
Since ten, I been feelin' lonely
Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged
Strangers make you feel so loved, you know?
And I'm happy by the way
That I made that jump, that leap of faith
I'm happy that it all worked out for me
I'ma make my fans so proud of me, oh
[Chorus]
I wanna run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life
Send me a gun and I'll see the sun
I'd rather run away
Don't wanna lie, I don't want a life

You
I can't wait for the nights with you
I imagine the things we'll do

[Verse 1: 42 Dugg & Scorpions]
Ain't nothin' plain on me, nigga, four chains on me (I just want to be loved by you)
I ain't trippin' 'bout that ho, nigga, she came on me
I got a bitch from the West, she'll suck a nigga soft
Bitch from the East, she'll fuck a nigga dawgs (No one like—)
Still playin' with that raw even though I got a deal
Had to get up out the city, I just got a nigga killed
Pause, I'm lyin', kinda, still sippin' out the Fanta
OxyContin and Opanas, I want four-two for each
Niggas upped Lou for free, that's my nigga, come and kick it
Mister still'll serve the city, I'm the reason it's some chicken
Why the fuck you in the kitchen tryna turn one?
Daire quit pullin' on thе blender 'fore you burn somе
Baby say she want a real nigga, but she don't get it
Why you ain't never up at night? I told you I been sippin'
Still go harder for my niggas, wish I could bring you back
Turntest in the city, white lows, blue flags
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Catch me in the city, young nigga, four chains
Signed to CMG, still in the dope game
I don't swipe propane, really got it out the mud
Big 4 Gang, catch me ridin' with the thugs
And I got it on my own, ain't nobody helped me
Remain humble, sell crack to dope fiends
You can't ""Lil' bro"" me, bitch, I really got a check
42 in this shit, I be really on that
Put the city on my back, still remember hard times
2018 was the year my dawg died
[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch]
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys
Peanut butter seats, all my windows tinted
Know I keep two flags on bang
I just dropped a Urus for the gang
Tied from the D to LA
Always keep it a hunnid K

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
Number one nigga, but they're never gon' admit it
I was doin' two-hundred in the 'Rari and got a ticket
Every time they see me, they say they ain't seen me in a minute
Probably fuckin' on your bitches, probably runnin' up the digits
Forgiato wheels, both lanes
Floor mats say a nigga name
Interrogation, feds tried to put us on the board, never identified
All my niggas always gettin' dough, it's always chicken time
I got niggas in the box, gon' call me collect
I got model bitches that be tryna call me for sex
And you know what they say, ""If it ain't directed, then don't respect it""
You see 'em out in public, they gon' act like they never said it
I see by the C-side, I throw it up two times
And your nigga got a gangster card, he bought it off Groupon
One of the young niggas that be gettin' love in the city
From the hub to the dub in the tub, fuck with me
[Chorus: 42 Dugg & Roddy Ricch]
Pull up in frog eyes, yeah nigga, we winning
Amiris on low, if not, wheat Timbs
Me and 42 pullin' up, twin Bentleys

I go and hit a lick, you can go and ask Bubba
Big blocks, tote real choppers
Whole lotta shooters, you don't want no problems
R.I.P. Junebug, taught me in the broad day
Tryna pay this lawyer for my lil' ones, gon' be a cold case
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
One thing I never seen was a bitch that leave
Every time I crank the car, I don't use a key
Push-start, foreign whip
Two glizzies, extended clips
I don't go a day bein' sober
Pour a lotta dope in my soda
Magic City, I'm the owner
Tell Steve Harvey I don't want her
Sixes brown, tickin' bomb, sippin' Dom Pérignon
Big ridin', really, I'm a don
Made these bitches wait in line
I done came out the muddy
I done put the most white diamonds on the blackest hoes

I'm just turnin' up for my city (Turn me up)
I'm just turnin' up for my city
I'm just turnin' up for my city (Turn me up)
I been turnin' up for my city
Grandma, daddy, mama, sister, I been through so much lately
Run it up and stash it, damn near two million on that mattress
CMG, that's who I signed to, but I like my pockets full
I got my game from the streets, I barely went to school
I know nine Dugg, slow down, shawty
Four times, I don't really like to squash
On my daddy, on my mama
I don't really like to squash"

Yeah, I met you 'fore anyone knew my name
Playin' for pennies on the dive bar stage
Split an all-star special on our first date in a Waffle House booth
Your daddy was cryin' when he gave you away
'Cause all those country songs I played
They didn't come with a 401k
But hey, I had you

[Chorus]
You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill
You can make my truck out in the driveway
Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac
Girl, lookin' at you lookin' at me that way
Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage
Girl, your love is money, your love is money
Yeah, your love can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

You can give me a tab that's always open
Or give me a yacht parked out in the ocean
But all that keepin' up with the Jones'
It just ain't my style
Just give me some lights strung out in the yard
Give me a lawn chair under the stars
The top of the world's right where you are
'Cause every time you smile

You can make a six pack on the carpet
Taste like a million dollar bill
You can make a one bed room apartment
Feel like a house up on the hill

Roll like a cleaned up Cadillac

Can make a man feel rich on minimum wage

170,2021,J. Cole,interlude,"[Intro]
Right, right, right, right
Something's got a hold on me
Right, right, right, right
Sometimes I think pain is just a lack of understanding
If we could only understand it all, would we feel no pain?
God must feel no pain
Something's got a hold on me
Only joy
Does this mean even our suffering pleases him?

[Verse]
Lost in a cloud of marijuana
Young Carolina nigga, fish out of water
Step-daddy just had a daughter with another woman
Mama ain't recover yet
Callin' me at 12 at night
She drunk as fuck and I'm upset
'Cause why she always using me for crutch?
Growin' up I used to always see her up
Late as shit, cigarette smoke and greatest hits from Marvin Gaye
She kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
I gotta leave this house 'cause part of me dies when I see her like this
Too young to deal with pain
I'd rather run the streets than see her kill herself
So 'Ville became my escape from a feelin' I hate
Mama cursing me out
Depression's such a villainous state
I used to stay out later on purpose
Subconsciously I was nervous that if I came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
And then I'd have to end up seein' my hero on ground zero
Tears flow while Al Green blow
Love and happiness
I wish that I could say the right words to cheer her up
I wish her son's love was enough
I tell her, ""Mama, go to sleep""
She tell me ""Boy, hush. You better pray to God you never get your heart crushed""
I shake my head in frustration
Head to my room and I can still hear the tunes with my door shut
Fuck it though, a couple more months I'll be gone
Off to college and dorms
Foolin' myself, thinkin' problems are gone
But now it's 1 AM and my mama dialin' my phone
I know she intoxicated and soon this high that I'm on comes crashin' down
She lit, talkin' drunk shit, I'm pissed
But I'm still all ears like Basset Hounds
Thinkin' to myself, ""Maybe my mama need help
Don't she got work in the morning?
Why she do this to herself?
Hate how she slurrin' her words
Soundin' so fuckin' absurd
This ain't the woman I know, why I just sit and observe?
Why don't I say how I feel?
When I do, she's defensive for real
Well maybe things get better with time, I heard it heals
Little did I know how deep her sadness would go
Lookin' back, I wish I woulda did more instead of runnin'
[Outro]
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be free
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Out of fear I won't be—
No!
Something's got a hold on me
I can't let it go
Right
Life can bring much pain
There are many ways to deal with this pain (right)
Choose wisely (right)"

And a bad bitch in the bed with me
She ain't got a shirt on
So I'm staring at her titties
Reminiscing about her dripping all night

I ain't never sold my soul
I own the fast route

I went and took the back roads
Put a blunt in my mouth

Or no clout, why?

Don't know about

Hold my crown
Talk all that weak shit
When I'm not around
I couldn't give a fuck
Nope
Not one ounce

To make it this far
But what do you know?
Fuck what you thought
Cause what do you know
What do you know?
NOTHING
So you can't tell me nothing
Said you had my back?
Boy you was fronting
Got a couple racks
Stuffed in the cushion
Just incase I say ""fuck it""
Go AWOL
Stop bugging
Grab the money and the drugs
And take off
Nah that ain't finna happen
You would love it
I'm here until I think
I'm posed in the mud
And my bro's crumble
Underneath the ground y'all walk
Bitch why you talking in the car
While my music on
Who said you were allowed to talk?

I'm in the Wynn, a million in chocolate chips
And that's just how my cookie crumble
I put a skirt on a whip and a crown on the six
But there's no need to dress up the numbers
Ayy, ayy, yeah
But I guess they must have they reasons
They wanna know how I'm livin' my day-to-day life in the regular season
[Chorus]
Well, summer, all I did was rest, okay?
And New Year's, all I did was stretch, okay?
And Valentine's Day, I had sex, okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen next
Okay? Okay? Okay?
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen, ayy
We'll see what's 'bout to happen

[Refrain]
I'm makin' a change today
The liquor been takin' the pain away
I heard you was givin' your chain away
That's kinda like givin' your fame away
What's wrong with you?
I sit in a box where the owners do
A boss is a role that I've grown into
I love you to death but I told you the truth

Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

Hmm, yeah, yeah

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh
Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand
Flag out my ass, no quick brand
I was packing on the pounds, got my weight up
Had beef on the streets, had to stay up
Betty Crocker showed me how to bake a cake, bruh
Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

[Verse 1]
Back in the day, man a nigga had rip jeans
Couldn't afford a new pair, I had broke seams
Couldn't think about the money, I had broke dreams
Outfit was the match of a crack fiend
I was tryna be fly, I couldn't take off
Clothes falling off my ass, lost weight, dawg
No jacket in the winter, had the shakes, dawg
Then I said, ""Fuck it,"" 'cause something gone have to shake, dawg
Then my nigga Bobby put me on a quick lick
Wasn't a lot but enough for a quick fix
Interceptions, I was stealing, caught me a pick six
In the snow pitching woe, bitch it was brick dick
Never killed, ain't gone lie, I was tempted
He was the target, but he lucky that I missed it
I was always fucking up, was a misfit
My opportunity was knocking and I missed it
Young when I hopped off the stoop
Two doors what I floor if I hop in the coupe
Too sore from a war where I couldn't lose
Got scars and bruises, man, I got the proof
Resemble young Steele 'cause I got the juice
You think you 2Pac, let Omar Epps loose
Stepping on necks with my Timberland boots
I'm planted, I'm stable, I'm growing in roots, yeah

Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

[Verse 2]
I remember chillin' at one of my little bitch crib
'Bout to fuck, 'bout to nut, main course with the fixings
Her nigga came through, he was all on some bitch shit
Didn't know I was raw and my hands was so gifted
Boy had me chop, had get him a mix quick
Couple knots made him drop like he drunk or he lifted
Fought another nigga after I thought was some kinship
Throwing up both of our sets which ended the friendship
Gave respect neck to neck, my nigga didn't back down
Had 'em standing up then he ended up back down
His hands in my life now they ended up flat now
Flat like a wing, let's see if he flap now
Had enough, it was tough only lasted about one round
K.D. on the bench equipped with the tre pound
Made 'em run, it was funny, he was scared of the gun sound
Made 'em shit, he a bitch, by the car he was ducked down
I ain't got no time for the fakes
The phonies, jabronies, the ops or the Jakes
My homies the only who come past the gate
I'm whacking the weeds, cutting heads off of snakes
I'm hungry, I'm eating right off of ya plate
I want it, I'm on it, it's mine for the take
I'm stagnant, a magnet, I'm staying in place
The reason I'm popping is all of the hate, yeah

Since a jit stood tall with a kickstand
Thinking of a plan to get quick bands
Falling in deep with the quicksand

Doing that put everything I love at stake, bruh

Throwing down at the spot
Three sheets, just me and the guys
Every single Saturday night
I was killing time, crushing cans
Trying not to catch a tan
'Cause I was under them neon lights
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Everybody knew they could find me there
And right out of the blue, right out of nowhere
Out of nowhere

[Chorus]
Sittin’ over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shaking to a little, shook me all night long
And I thought, ""Man, what a beautiful sight""
Ain't a mornin' you don’t wake up in my shirt now
Even holding hands walkin' out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?
Yeah
My last single Saturday night

[Verse 2]
And now when I'm out, havin' a drink or two
If they see me, uh, well, they see you
'Cause, girl, I got you by my side
Every single Saturday night, yeah
Every now and then, the boys tell me they miss me
Oh but they all get it 'cause they were right there with me
Yeah with me, when

Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw
Shakin’ to a little, shook me all night long

Even holding hands walkin’ out of church now
Who'd of thought, baby, looking back that
That would be my last single Saturday night?

The last time that I'd by a drink for a girl I'd never met before
I wasn’t looking for love when I walked through the door
But damn if I didn't find what I wasn't even looking for

Sittin' over in the corner, baby, I saw
Pretty red lips, working on a White Claw

We all been there some days
Thought I needed something else
And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out
And baby, I needed space
Ain't nobody 'round here on your level
You're so far away
You're pouring your heart out

Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready

No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)

Nigga suck my dick!
In the most disrespectful way I can spit it to you
All that shit you say you wishin' a nigga would do, niggas did it to you
I'll leave a hole big enough to fit a midget through
I'ma introduce the world to a clown
And I don't need help from Steven King to present It to you
Steven King Presents It, oh it's a different vibe
All that Champion Of The Year money, this clown ass nigga still don't know how to use his penny wise (Pennywise)
But when me and Jimmie rock, Suge the shooter and driver, watch how the Hemi slide
Shotgun out the window in Compton, the same alley where Ricky died
Oh nah that was South Central
So I let a round hit you from a loud pistol
When I could quietly stab you in the navel and just drag what's in the south, central
Out in Compton, I'll roll in ya neighborhood, hippie vibes
Six shooter, old man revolver, but I give a 60, five
Oh but you Nutty Blocc, you Compton Crip, my mistake then
You still bang the Six God, you'll get beat wit' a .40 ain't talkin' Drake friend
Ain't no beast to unleash you just be caged in
How I'ma believe the bars your pen state when it took you this long to get past the bars in the state pen'?
But you Nutty Blocc, Compton Crip, big C's you throwin' 'round
'Til you assigned a wheelchair for the rest of ya life, pussy  you Rolling now
I'll grab ya bitch head, while she bobbin' for apples and push her nose in now
Why? Cause I promised Gotti if he went back to jail I would hold you down
Oh but you big Crip? But you give me no option
How I'm supposed to believe your set run the west when half the world includin' the neutral niggas refer to yo' city as ""Bompton""
Let a nigga say they from ""Bewark, New Jersey""
Nigga that semi go choppin'
Smack, Chico, Beasley, Avoca- ain't no fuckin' video's droppin'
I make a movie wit' the toaster, shotgun in the armpit
Kick back gon' make me do the Lil' Uzi wit' the shoulder straps
I would've brought a TEC wit' a 100 clip just so I could give him a Hot 97
And niggas wonder why I Flex
I'm from a city where mothers die for sets
I really live what's in my notebook pussy, my life a Butterfly Effect
I said, nigga don't talk that street shit to the concrete
Cause I laid the foundation and paved the way for you Prodigy's to be able to cause Havoc and even Mobb Deep
Nigga my .9 speak
I pull up on Gotti at five guys, we nine deep
Hmm, now I beat y'all all of this hair on his side burns; Ashanti
I'll get this dummy shot, both arms up, I'm doin' the Mummy Bop
My whole avenue retarded, ""Me, I'm really from Nutty Blocc""
Now if we heard Gotti shootin', what he playin'? Prolly 2K
For nigga keep goin' back to jail on purpose, what that mean to y'all? Prolly he gay
Ya mother said you can be anything you put ya mind to, right? And she proud of you, hey
Well I could give a fuck what ya ma-ma-mama said bitch, you ain't Bobby Boucher
So don't talk to me like I'm stupid, cause your Tommy unemployed
Bitch I ain't Cole
Stab wound through his chest, then push the bullet through the same hole
I never went down, cause I never got caught, my niggas ain't told
Why? Cause I do my shit all by my lonely like I'm J. Cole
I don't wanna know what ya life like
Or what ya stain in ya hood and what your stripes like
Just know that I got triple what they paid you, plus PayPerView, so what's your price like?
Kimbo Slice, Miami backyard, I'm tryin' to fight fight
Kevin Hart told me Gotti the nigga tryin' to go night night
Now I tried to show you that there's a better you nigga
A side of you that you never knew
I'ma show you how involving yourself in the beef will turn you to a vegetable
Nigga you ever have real fiends beggin' you for the residue?
I'm from a city where niggas will literally chop ya neck off ya shoulder just to say they got ahead of you
You talkin' like you play wit' birds?
Nigga, ya dead homies got what they deserved
I came to Compton just to spit in ya mother mouth and smoke my favorite herb
Now you in front of the judge and you don't play with verbs
Stupid nigga got convicted for everything he was up against
Y'all tryin' to convince me that he got a way with words
Man my shit is real and you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick! And let these people believe them lies
Nigga time!
[Round 1: Geechi Gotti]
Nigga that shit was fire!
For real, he was spittin' some retarded shit
Up here dressed like a 'How To Be A Crip' starter kit
Nigga you'se a bitch!
Do somethin', I'll really shoot somethin'
Cross my line, and I'll shut the Volume down like a mute button
Nigga you stuntin'
I liked you better back in them Grind Time mode
But this the URL, this my shit now
And ever since I been the Champ, all these niggas want smoke
I don't see no lies told
Ask Smack
Soon as these niggas come to the crib, I'm the first thing they ask about like the wi-fi code
Nigga y'all like hoes, be in ya inner circle's whisperin' 'bout me
'Til you meet me and realize you just a 300 and I'm a Bentley
Breakfast Club ass niggas, y'all see (C) Da God and envy
You be on D shit, shout out to them Damu's
Y'all know how we do
My real niggas know if I holla ""Asante""
[?]
See now if he knew, he would've hollered out ""[?]""
But see that's why I got a question Crippin', this a lesson given
You need to figure out if gang bangin' was yo' best decision
See the west is listenin'
Just like we supposed to, cause you from New Jersey and Grape Street
So do you got a problem with the east coast too?
Cause Grape Street beef wit' the east coast, but you from the east coast
Ain't that like a conflict of interest?
I guess what's happenin' in Watts ain't none of y'all niggas business
Y'all niggas bitches, you a hoe Ars'
Gotti let the fo' spark
Catch him in his whip, I'll turn that bitch to a go kart
Headshot, need the locks on the do'; I'm Joe Clark
You don't want no part
I already bodied Suge, now Arsonal comin' straight for a vengeance
It ain't jelly when I say I got some artificial Grapes on my biscuits
Y'all be my witness
I'ma need two caskets, Red can get it too since you yappin'
But his apple in a box with the Grapes, it's a fruit basket
Nigga I'm spazzin', Gotti got the juice now
Mix Red's blood on top of Grapes and make it Fruit Town
Nigga you clowns, I'm a real nigga, that shit ain't on me, bitch the shit in me
Gun under the chin, leave a hole that exit out the top, that shit a chimney
It offend me, when you be actin' like you from them JD projects, but ain't put on none of them niggas
But you on the rap game makin' money for one of JD's projects
But I guess, I'll let the .40 bank heads, that's if he outta line
Lemon squeeze in his face, it's our (sour) time
The bottom line, I got a lot of ways I can murder him
If I'm choosing where to shoot, I'ma pick his locks like a burglary
The nerve of me, I'm back on that dumb shit
Hand gun with the drum clip, I'm dumpin' the .40, I want a young bitch
Nigga, one hit, will have his mind gone, he brain dead
Now a machine help him with his words like Rhymezone
Nigga we in different time zones
I'm on that Pacific time, grippin' mine
If this don't work, Twork voice, I got a bigga .9
This a crime
I was in jail when my patna got shot, DOA
I'm talkin' he didn't get away to the doctor
I came home to put in work for him, feelin' just like Meek in a helicopter
Cause I got out and went straight to a chopper
You in the face of a mobster!
I'll have every nigga here stretch him
Pistol whip, blunt force to the face, this peer pressure
These niggas talkin', well I'ma keep on talkin'
Nina sparkin', I've been on so many missions, bitch I'm tired of guns, I got heat exhaustion
This nigga's a fuckin' bus driver
Rappin' gangsta shit
I don't believe the nonsense, I'll show up to your job and pop on campus, it's a parent teacher conference
Nigga we believe in violence
I'll catch ya bitch and let the lead pop
All I heard was ""ooh"" ""ah"" ""eh"" before the headshot
The same bitch with different Screams; Sidney Prescott
The TEC's cocked, I get ya granny goin' to bed, put the silencer on it so the sound gone
If I let it spray, think ""graduation day"", that old bitch gettin' caped wit' her gown on
You a clown bro, Shoebox saved you in Detroit, that's the only reason you around us bro
I came from shootouts, bustin' 'til there ain't shit comin' out this hoe
I'm sayin', we both been saved by the Cal' befo'
And when it's-
Y'all can tell, you can see it in they eyes
Go 'head make niggas believe them lies
Nigga time
[Round 2: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! For the second time
And now I said it to your face Crip
This like workplace harassment
I violate all your personal space bitch
I'm that cousin always on punishment, I'm not the nigga you can play wit'
So what I'm from the east nigga, gang bangin' is gang bangin', we on the same shit
I ain't new to this, I've been bangin' half my life, you must be misinformed
Oh I get it, I hardly, it hardly rain in southern California so you think we weather a different storm
Y'all know why me and this Ray Swag in the face ass nigga ain't never gon' get along?
Because you'd rather go to jail than break yo' mama heart showin' you tough, provin' some other niggas wrong
You still tryin' to prove you tough when you ride wit' yo' city
You said it yo'self you in the Grandee's 24/7 nigga
So when you gonna spend some time wit' yo' kids?
Yo youngest son really miss his daddy
And yo' patna teachin' him how to hold a gun
It's funny you spent more time in jail with yo' bunkie, but didn't spend that much time outside wit' yo' oldest son
See, who don't spend time wit' they kids, I don't support those
It's my job to fire, and leave you dead in your ""showin' up to court clothes.""
Niggas who think they Nutty on my Blocc, I extort those
All you hear is a loud BANG, remind you of how that county cell door close
Gettin' locked up is easy nigga
I can do some shit right now that's gon' land me in jail
Why is it so hard for you niggas to realize bein' absent from your kids life will leave them damaged as well?
You out here glorifyin' incarceration, this nigga scared to get mail
Nigga I give you five years tops 'til you and your oldest son together sharin' a cell
Nigga what?!
You think that jail shit scare me now?
Naw, what's scary is bein' the only nigga free in yo' hood and you gotta take care of all of yo' homies' families now
I'm on the phone with my nigga that's never comin' home
Tellin' him I just let his granny down
Nigga I come to Cali just to walk on yo' grass pussy, you Stanley now
Nigga you gon' meet karma
My hands speak fast and my reach longer
I never went to prison and I stayed free, so who really been on these streets longer?
Oh, oh oh, I'll slap this bitch, now it's gettin' domestic
You standin' there wit' yo' head down and yo' hands behind yo' back
You that used to gettin' arrested?
All that time you spent away from your two boys? I blame the game for it
But God already made him pay for it
They gave him life in the insane asylum, and they assigned him to the A. Ward
I'ma be straight forward, I'ma son of a gun, my mama was ratchet
But she told me, ""Never speak about ya pops.""
I ain't never tell on a soul, nothin' to speak about the cops
You got one style of rap nigga, you don't speak about a lot
But I get it, you wrote all your bars in prison you don't really know how to think outside the box
Nigga ya whole life was tied to the system
Stupid, you always guilty, DUH
That's why you rhyme with conviction
You look the part so ya lines in convincin'
Low cut, fucked up teeth Crip
Nigga you match beyond the description
And the nigga on Youtube, he got- he- he like, ""Yo, welcome to my hood. This the trap trap
The building over there on 165 and 166, oh that's where they make the packs at
Oh yeah that alley over there when the cops run down it's where we throw the straps at.""
Dispatch on the other line like, ""10-4 did you catch that?""
He ain't done he still goin', he said, ""Yo aye cuz, this wall right here cuz, it's full of dead homies I wish I could bring back to life
Lil' Half A Slice, on Nutty man he was a killer. He lived the savage life.""
He said, ""Aye cuz, what he'd kill, 'bout ten niggas before he made the sacrifice?""
Nigga you tellin' everything, you out here gettin' niggas indited in the after-life
Ya name ""Bay Loc""
You a fat Derrick Rose, man you gon' stay broke
And a victim of the system
No anesthesia through this incision, we need you to stay woke
Nigga, I'm here to snatch every bit of saliva out ya bae throat
Hit once then make the bitch disappear like she Def Loaf
Now between me and Gotti, it's a distance
You from where gang bangin' originated, so why I'm
{Stream cuts out}

Between me and Gotti it's a distance
Cause you went from where gang bangin' originated, but I'm more world wide known for this Crippin'
I'm Crip, you gon' be disabled there's a difference
Your bitch gotta take my dick twice a day after she eat, my shit prescription
Some shit'll never change, I'm super Crip
In my car I got the handicap sign up and everythang
That mean I get to park closer to ya job givin' me the aim
Dessy rang, I'm hittin' innocent by-standards,  I ain't got deadly aim
So I cut him in slow-mo
Word to Dobo, I put that on everythang
I go berserk on him
Bury his body I throw the dirt on him
I set him up, I had my unemployed bitch throw the work on him
Catch ya spirit headed to the afterlife, I throw the scope on him
But I ain't pull the trigger, old fashioned ass whoopin'
Beat him wit' the stick until it broke on him
He a rat, I put the cheese on his head like he from Green Bay
You the man? Well not 'round here, nigga Dikembe
Boy, the way I do you with this fourth and inches, just watch the replay
I'ma keep on cuttin' him and bringin' him back like I was a DJ
I'll put the muzzle on it, then I aim .9
What that mean? I kill him and give that moment of silence at the same time
As long as he get hospitalized tonight, I'll remain calm
Cause honestly, Gotti he could Die Another Day word to James Bond
My shit is real, you can see it in my eyes
Suck my dick and let these niggas believe yo' lies
Nigga time!

[Round 2: Geechi Gotti]
All these, behind bars bars, was the type of shit you had niggas laughin' 'bout
I find it funny, how you could condemn me cause I'm goin' to jail for the shit you be rappin' 'bout
I got you niggas bangin' again
If y'all wasn't doin' it then, nigga don't be doin' it now
Tryin' to show me you gangsta, only make me think you niggas clowns
Even the vets, talk all that shit about the PG process
Then get on the card with me and all of a sudden it's the Proving Grounds
Nigga, you'se a clown
You was a Blood I heard that turned Grape Street
That's some weird shit
I knew he was a fag, cause only queers switch
Nigga real shit, you a bitch in the streets but you wanna be a Crip in the ring
Arm to his chest, look like his shit in a sling
This bitch wit' a beam
I'll steam his face, nigga I'll kill ya kid, now you a seedless Grape
Ain't no need to hate nigga, y'all straight bitches
The only battle rappers from Grape Street, is Aktive and Dre Vishiss
Tryin' to act like Grape a hood that you love
You givin' him three up top but you never booked him on UDubb!
Nigga, I'm disrespectful just like cuz, except the bars heavy
I'll kidnap ya daughter, you find her Trapped In The Closet wit' R. Kelly
Yeah I'm disrespectful, you ain't gon' do a damn thang 'bout it
I'll kill that lil' bitch, show up to her funeral, get her obituary, make a paper plane out it
Yo' little girl, that's ya world? You better keep her out my way aight
I usually don't hit kids, but today I might
Choke her, 'til you got a Blueface baby, 'Yeah Aight'
You goddamn right, I'll put the blade to his daughter's scalp
Make sure that lil' bitch in pain
How the fuck y'all callin' Arsonal ""Da Rebel"" but I'm the one goin' against the grain
This shit insane
Ya baby mama look good, ooh them tits soft
After I fuck her I use his daughter clothes to wipe my dick off
I'm disrespectful, I'm tryin' to figure him out
I hope on them field trips they say, ""This dude nuts""
I hope on them field trips you catch yo' daughter givin' head on the back of ya school bus
This dude nuts
I been tryin' to figure him out
I seen his daughter, I said ""You would never succeed (suck seed) until somebody bust they kids in ya mouth!""
Look what he did for the clout!
He been rappin' like that 15+
I can't remember a time he was lyrical
The King Of Disrespect? He ain't got enough respect for the craft to write fire material
I'm tired of hearin' you
I don't even think you no real nigga, I can tell by yo' demeanor
You became a bus driver cause you ain't have the smarts to be a teacher
Nigga you a leecher
Ride every nigga wave that you close to
Scream Fetty Wap name all last year, he ain't even post you
You a weirdo
Portrayed to be a Loc by your peers though
I know ya fears bro
You wear that purple flag so in Cali you got a spot for protection
But tell these niggas how when you in Cali you scared to even go to ya section
Nigga look in the mirror
I be he see a hoe in the reflection
I'm talkin' real shit, ain't nothin' outta context
If he wasn't a rapper, he wouldn't have even stepped foot in them projects
But I guess, he better be glad he can rap
Cause you ain't no shooter from them Bricks, that's an actual fact
But since you can rap and you bangin' they shit puttin' 'em on
They let him do it, they just gotta tax you for that
It's tax season! The whole projects claimin' him as a dependent
Payin' grown men for protection, that gotta be weird
Tell Suge he should be cool showin' up now, they show love to big bitches 'round this time of the year
We not the same!
I really had to put in work for my name
True story, I done really put niggas on shirts for the game
This nigga made a game; Arsonal's Revenge
(Aye, for real they gon' buy that shit)
Arsonal's Revenge, aye but that don't mean he 'bout his business or his wealth
It's just like I been tellin' y'all
He good at creatin' an image for himself
Yeah you bang Grape Street but in Watts you be scared faggot, I know ya story
Can't show up to the projects without a care package
Every time he come over there, shit be feelin' like Christmas
Got him givin' out money and free Fetty Wap tickets
How he talkin' Grape Street like he really wit' that
If he was, how come when Suge got robbed he ain't get his shit back?
Grape Street that nigga, Grape Street this
Them niggas took ya phone and ya motherfuckin' jewelry, you ain't been back on Grape Street since
He had trouble wit' that
Brand new .50, I can't even feel the kickback
This a clean cal', you can tell by the Gun Title it got a Double Impact
Nigga if you ain't shootin' shit, you can't even talk to Gotti
I'm a walkin' homi
Nigga believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see
They prolly don't even understand what I'm talkin' prolly
Cause the news said I dropped a nigga, that was a lie
I caught the body!
And when it's real, y'all tell
(You can see it in they eyes
Go head, it's yo' turn, make them nigga believe them lies
Nigga time)

[Round 3: Arsonal]
Nigga suck my dick! Third times a charm
I thought you would've swung by now
This nigga ain't got no fight left in him, he like, ""He already won by now.""
I admire you knowin' you couldn't beat me but him still try
But you popped up at the wrong time, that's an in-field fly
Meaning ya hitter out immediately
Ya runners? Lookin' hesitant
12, 13, 14 letters of the alphabet, Gotti you way outta ya element
Get ya bars up, I don't get stuck in the moment, I'll leave a star struck
Serve him through the window early morn', ""Welcome to Starbucks""
Gun spark, light flash, you think a photo man behind ya
No! Tommy in his face barkin' in his face like, ""I don't know no damn Kiana.""
I'ma be real wit' niggas
Smack and Beasley, they tryin' to build a nigga
Code word [?]
They fly me in to give a meal (mil') to niggas
Telekinesis powers when I'm mad, I Matilda niggas
I got still for niggas, meet my New Edition, I'm Johnny Gill wit' niggas
BOOM! Through ya front door, knock ya bitch up, then pick her up
Put the deuce to his head like I was tryin' to fuck the picture up
Show up to the funeral, reach in the casket and grab ya sister butt
Cause my first name ""I Don't"", last name ""Give A Fuck""
AKA Durrell ""Disrespectful"" Jones
I'm not ya friend brother
I'll slap the dog shit outta you and ya friend mother
How many times you copped out at court? Let's not pretend brother
You would've been a house nigga, and I can tell by ya skin color
Nigga my tool is chunky, ya father fell in love with a foolish junkie
I stay ten toes down with my fuckin' chin up, I don't care who confront me
You a flunky and ya whole hood green
That's why ya son remind me of the lil' nigga H&M had referred to as the ""coolest monkey""
I wish I was the doctor standin' in-between ya bitch legs when she was givin' birth
Cause that would've solidified my spot as the one nigga who get to smack that lil' nigga first
Yeah, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck
You want a birth death?
I almost kill him on purpose just to say him and watch him struggle through his first breaths
Soon as the nigga 'bout to walk, I clip him before he take his first steps
Him and his other brother, they competin' who gon' have the worst death
Rebel shit
This level of success, you will never get
Special Olympics, I'm here to show y'all who the better Crip
Grape Street, we the gang
Speak in vain, heaters bang
We Crippin' form a different point of view, we don't see the same
Nigga, to me you still a tiny Loc nigga
So take this L and let that L sit
You came in here lookin' for Ars' and got Durrell bitch
I'm quick to let a shell kick
For goin' against the grain, what I'm raising (raisin) will put a Nut' in the bag we makin' trail mix
But you don't even think like that
Last night in Le Palace you yellin', ""Anything possible"" and you don't even drink like that
I'll walk up in ya son's school
Go to the oldest lil' nigga class
Rex ad lib, yell ""That nigga dead!"" when he say he miss his dad
Man, in front of his classmates I'll fuckin' whip his ass
Man, and then walk downstairs and tell ya younger son, ""Go stand in the street in front of that hell cat.""
Then I did the dash
Y'all wanna know what happened next?
I hit his ass!
I knocked him so far back he flew into the Ghost Of Christmas Past
Last time the nigga seen his daddy, he had to kiss the glass
Next time gon' be to identify him and zip the bag
I said, my bitch toughened up
I ain't gotta shoot or do an uppercut
Code word: Orgasm
(What that mean?)
She was trained to squirt and bust a Nut'

[Girl in crowd]
Talk naaasty!

[Arsonal]
He said, she said, I don't care what niggas said 'bout him
One day he true blue, BAOW! Next mornin' niggas read (red) 'bout him (bottom)
Baow! Baow! Baow! Another one blew (blue)
Blaow! And it knocked all of the red out him
Then you gon' see a Grape Street Crip moonwalkin' through the blood just to say I did it in red bottoms
Now if I pull up, it's gon' be Glocks involved
Mops and all, I'm lettin' rockets off
{Cell phone sound} Brrrrrrrt
The doctor makin' a Compton call
Surgery! Blottin' up his exit wounds with cotton balls
You just sell wigs, I get paid to knock 'em off!
I said, is we talkin' colors here? Or your profession and how you color hair?
I'll slap ya nephew in front of ya mother to see if ya brother care
Somebody please dare me to do it
(I dare you)
Do I hear a double dare?
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
Ya bitch mouth had my finger, dick and balls in it
She did it in front of ya house and didn't even give a fuck, cause the car tinted
We had a gang bang last night...she was involved in it
My shit is real, my shit is raw my shit is authentic
And you can't spell ""Bars"" without puttin' that ""Ars"" in it

[Smack]
Last round it's on-

[Arsonal]
Nah, sike I lied nigga
No, sike I lied nigga
Sike you died nigga
You made ten thousand dollars
Ten thou- man that's pocket change
You know what happened when they Dow jumped?
Man, let's just say I'm tied into the stock exchange
I mean, you said I was on tour, I was gettin' a lot of money with Fetty Wap and thangs
Where your Champion Of The Year money?
Cause I got a whole lot of gwap and thangs
You got Champion Of The Year money, why don't you put it to your ear dummy
This ""Trapion"" Of The Year money
Time nigga

[Round 3: Geechi Gotti]
Aye, y'all just seen that stack that this nigga pulled out?
That's a whole lot of money that he made from this art form
I hope after you die today, you give a little bit of that money to ya BM and ya daughter, that can be a nice lil' start for 'em
I mean you gotta give 'em somethin', cause I heard the stories
They said you barely for 'em
I'm just sayin', they bitches better pray they in ya will (wheel) like a car horn
Nitty already buried Suge
Now these niggas finna get a casket together
Said he ain't know Shotgun...they up here rappin' together
Y'all the fakest of friends
Headshot, when I say, ""The doc tryin' to patch things up"", he ain't makin' amends
Ain't no shakin' my hand
You do a whole lotta weak shit
In the field, the strap got no safety, we in goal line defense
They said ""Bro ain't got a weakness"" that's 'til the can' clap you
Hospital beds, rubber bands wrap you
His family like, ""How he doin'?""
I don't know, he just popped up on the 'tube, he a Banned battle
Nigga I'm from Nutty Blocc, this shit deeper than just a tattoo
You slapped the hat off Iron, I'll grab the iron and slap you!
That's a fact too, you a lil' boy to me Arsonal
Gave him the .9, the .40 and then the chopper
Just thought he needed a little more in him Arsonal (arsenal)
Fuck Arsonal though, cause if Ray Swag was here I would've shot him right in front of you
I would've gave him two in his brains
Niggas would've been yellin' for you to get ya dawg (dog) like he was loose from the chain
Nigga what you do for the game?
Niggas know I be in Compton with the Crips
AK's really poppin' and shit
Marshall Lawrence, the way we had to chop into bricks
Nigga I'm hittin' licks
A young nigga, makin' racks, I'm just statin' facts
The Feds was hot, I had to play the back
I'm just sayin', the pigs was all over ya dawg (dog), I was bakin' raps (bacon wraps)
Nigga face the facts
How you supposed to be a killer, but you ain't killed nothin' or drilled nothin'?
Walked in the house with blood on my shirt, told my mama I spilled somethin'
Steel dumpin', I'm still thuggin'
If they would've got the prints off the gun I wouldn't be here
You would've seen the kid do life
But I'm way too sharp like a Ginsu knife
Blue rag over the handle, that's a cloth over the grip like the lid too tight
Nigga you too light! I really came from shootouts
Check the score nigga, we up
On the missions, we just pray we make it back like the re-up
You see us, this what real Crippin' look like
You starin' at dope when it come back cooked right
I'm talkin' in the trap
Rare Breeds, we got it brick by brick
The smokers knew it was freebase like we got hit by pitch
Nigga this my shit
And these niggas be worryin' 'bout the wrong shit
Like if we should've stopped watchin' football cause of Kaepernick
Niggas die in my hood everyday, news just don't capture shit
Celebrities could talk about it, we just want 'em to do it
Crazy, while you was busy boycottin' the NFL my boy caught a bullet
I rep the gang to the fullest
I'm talkin' 'bout we shootin' 'til the lead gone
Tell the youth
""Ain't nothin' in this lifestyle but death. That's the truth.""
I be prayin' I was dead wrong
But where I'm from, when you be too hard headed, you end up a head stone
I'm from the streets, that's what they made sidewalks fo'
Niggas done really died on my block
Even standin' too close to the curb will get a nigga hit, we playin' sideline pop
Nigga I'm from the streets for real, they- aye ask about me in my hood
I was a young nigga, lettin' that lead fly shorty
I'm talkin' 16 fuckin' wit' a .40
Tell Lifetime I'm ready to tell my story
Survivin' the streets, if y'all would've seen what I seen, maaan, y'all prolly wouldn't have made it out
I'm tellin' you, this shit prolly would've made cuz quit
So many homies in the cemetery it's like they workin' graveyard shift
Nigga and I peep my nigga Knocca, sometimes I be wishin' I could go wit' him
So many niggas I done lost, I ain't got no mo' love in my heart
{Takes off his shoe}
Even my shoe ain't got a sole (soul) in 'em
Nigga every strap, got a pole in 'em
Two shots, that's why I clapped him
Another shot, body bagged him
Cause the third rounds just hit harder like when I be rappin'
It's a real life struggle everyday in the trenches
.40 goin' over my options, I'm tryin' to make a decision
Nigga Roc voice, ""It's me dawg.""
I'm from Nutty Blocc, hub in the dub, Watts
Nigga I show love to my Grape Street so free 03 and free Hogg
And when it's real y'all can tell, y'all can see it in they eyes
(Go 'head)
See if he can believe them lies
Nigga time"

[Интро: Дрейк]
Эй, нежней, нежней, попробуй удовлетворить меня, меня, меня

[Припев: Дрейк]
Ты можешь найти меня где-то в Лондоне, там моё укромное местечко
Мне срочно нужно, чтобы ты отсосала мне и поддержала меня морально
Я вносил в тебя пожертвования, будто ты United Way (Ты знаешь это)
Все истории, которые ты рассказывала мне о нём, я могу отличить ночь и день
Он сам рассказал мне правду
Я просто иду в свою спальню и чувствую себя так, будто она в милях от меня
Тут так много комнат

[Постприпев: Ганна]
Я всё ещё очень силён, никого не боюсь
Проезжаю на своей фантомной тачке, мои друзья не предадут
Я получаю большие деньги, тачки у меня — одна экзотика

[Куплет 1: Дрейк]
Мотор ревёт, воу
Городские мечты и надежды, я должен исполнить их
Меня интересуют мнения, но зачем?
Она хочет демона, йеа
Она хочет обручальное кольцо и моё соглашение, йеа
Что-то тут опасно
Я хочу поменять всё вокруг, я буду требовать это, йеа
Я хочу, чтобы она была накрашена, йеа
Но она сразу сказала мне «Нет», потому что знает, что она и так бриллиант, йеа
Она больше не спорит со мной, йеа
Она на диете, ей нужен массаж, йеа
Пытаюсь с ней уединиться, эй
Банковский счёт никогда не подводил меня, йеа
Ниггеры в жизни не такие крутые, йеа
«Жёсткие» ниггеры в жизни ведут себя иначе, йеа
Запрыгиваем в мой «танк» и двигаемся, будто мы на войне, йеа, йеа, йеа, йеа
[Припев: Дрейк]
Ты можешь найти меня где-то в Лондоне, там моё укромное местечко
Мне срочно нужно, чтобы ты отсосала мне и поддержала меня морально
Я вносил в тебя пожертвования, будто ты United Way (Ты знаешь это)
Все истории, которые ты рассказывала мне о нём, я могу отличить ночь и день
Он сам рассказал мне правду
Я просто иду в свою спальню и чувствую себя так, будто она в милях от меня
Тут так много комнат

[Предприпев: Ганна]
Я всё ещё очень силён, никого не боюсь
Проезжаю на своей фантомной тачке, мои друзья не предадут
Я получаю большие деньги, тачки у меня — одна экзотика

[Куплет 2: Ганна]
Мой багажник на месте двигателя
Я на миссии на своём Бронко 250
Мы с тобой в разных дивизионах
Я удивил их, знаю, обставил их чисто за минуту
Она явно была в восторге
Я люблю её цацки от Chrome Hearts, ублюдки нам завидуют
Прикосновение, как у Мидаса
Она мне сказала: «Трахни меня и кончи», и я просто сделал это, как LoverBoy Nike
Я заказал целый самолёт для тебя и твоих друзей
Катаю тебя туда-сюда на своём большом Мерсе
У меня есть одна сучка, которую я достал со дна
Тратим с ней горы денег на шоппинг в Лондоне
Сначала были лишь наедине, но сейчас всё уже публично
Я знаю, что мы — тема обсуждения для тебя и твоих детей
Моя жизнь — Монополия, разориться не вариант
Если бы они могли, то попробовали остановить меня
Но они всё равно были бы мертвы
Если она парик, то ей не стоит лезть мне на голову
Не испытывай мои эмоции
Не написывай мне СМС каждый день, я буду игнорить
Я люблю и стараюсь быть милым
Киска моей сучки мокрая, как океан, из-за этого мне придется поменять покрывало
Она была избрана быть моей
Молодой Ганна Wunna всегда сосредоточен, я не позволю им разозлить меня
[Куплет 3: Янг Таг]
Нет, они не смогут меня разозлить
Я украсил своё запястье розовым золотом, оно прям блестит
Я просто навёл стрелку часов на 50 тысяч
Я только что насчитал 10 лямов, всё наличными, федералы отсосали (У-у-у)
Я сказал ему, что если он продолжит с нами играть
То его дреды перестанут расти (Перестанут расти)
Я только что поговорил с моим Порше цвета мяты
Чёрт, я даже не ездил на нём в этом году (Скр, скр, скр, скр)
Взгляни на панорамные двери (Двери)
С нами генг, тянем лин, в руках пушки (А, оу, йеа)
Я большой пёс на своём районе (Воу)
У неё мини-юбка, там легко всё увидеть (А, а)
Я не расскажу этой сучке о своих целях (Своих целях)
Если бы он жила в Монтроузе (Монтроуз)
Я обычный человек, но, как игрок, я не беднею (Йеа)
Когда-то подумывал о том, чтобы продать свою душу (Ву-у)
Увези меня за пределы страны и брось в квартире
Она не увидит, как я плачу
Я положил макароны с сыром в свой карман, а потом всё это вытекло у меня из штанов
Я просто положил 20 лямов на депозитный счёт
И мне похуй на твою жизнь
У тебя была трава, но её было слишком мало
Клянусь, ты никогда не была хороша"

You know you can call me if you need someone
I'll pick up the pieces if you come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone

[Chorus]
I need you to hold on
Heaven is a place not too far away
We all know I should be the one
To say we all make mistakes (We all make mistakes)
Take my hand and hold on
Tell me everything that you need to say
'Cause I know how it feels to be someone (Someone)
Feels to be someone who loses their way

[Verse 2]
You're looking for answers in a place unknown
You need the connection but you can't get close (Can't get close)

Painting stars up on your ceiling
'Cause you wish that you could find some feeling, yeah, you
You know you can call me if you need someone
[Chorus]
I need you to hold on (Hold on)

186,2021,P!nk,All I Know So Far,"[Verse 1]
Haven't always been this way
I wasn't born a renegade
I felt alone, still feel afraid
I stumbled through it anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules
The little that I know I'll tell to you
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth

[Chorus]
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far
That's all I know so far

[Verse 2]
So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line

[Chorus]
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
That's all I know so far
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far

[Refrain]
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far

[Bridge]
I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes
Up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up
Yeah
When it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up
'Til the world blows up
And we will be enough and until the world blows up
[Chorus]
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars
That's all I know so far

[Refrain]
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far
That's all I know, that's all I know so far

I will be with you 'til the world blows up, hm"
187,2021,Duncan Laurence,Arcade,"[Verse 1]
A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

[Pre-Chorus]
I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Verse 2]
How many pennies in the slot?
Giving us up didn't take a lot
I saw the end 'fore it begun
Still I carried, I carried, I carry on
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game

[Bridge]
I don't need your games, game over
Get me off this rollercoaster

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
All I know, all I know
Loving you is a losing game"

I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight

If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night

I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you

You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right

You're not the type to give yourself enough love
She live her life, hand in a tight glove
I wish that I could fix it, I could fix it for you
But instead I'll be right here comin' through
(Right here coming through)

You said that I've been actin’ different, yeah
Funny how I finally flipped the script on you
When you the one who's double-dippin', yeah
You so sloppy, how I caught you slippin’ up
You're off the lease
Run me my keys
No more poppin' up to hit it, yeah
I ain't even got the miles to trip on you

[Pre-Chorus]
New phone (Who is this?)
Brand new like the whip
Rack it up, no assist
Main bitch, I ain't average
Wake up, need a zip
Hennessy, take a sip
Look at my jeans, I'm too thick
I ain't got the room for extra baggage

Don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
Don’t leave no piеces (Oh, oh)
You need to hurry and pick up your, ooh-ooh, feelings
While I’m up cleaning

Oh, I'm tryna find a fuck to give for you
You ran out of chances of forgivin’ ya
Yeah, listen, I ain't listenin'
Just for you to go and break my heart again

Woah, and I ain't comin' (Back now)
You're missin' what you had now (Had now)
And I bet you I look better, don't I?

No more benefits
Pop-up visits
Hands tied, no grip

So don't forget to come and pick up your, ooh, feelings
And don't leave no pieces (Yeah, hey)
You need to hurry and pick up your (Pick up your) feelings

So you can run them streets

But it's always kinda sunny out
And I don't wanna hurt no more
So I set my bar real low

You say it but you just don't mean it
You're so insane, you're so insane
Shut up and just enjoy this feeling

No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?

Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind
'Cause it's half-past three and my brain's on fire

Well, I can't fall asleep, and I'm losing my mind

No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
I may be wrong (I may be wrong)
It's stupid but it's all I have
Don't you love it? Don't you love it?
No, I ain't happy yet, but I'm way less sad

194,2021,Future & Lil Uzi Vert,Drankin N Smokin,"[Intro: Future]
Saggin' out the malls, we do the most, oh
Had a ratchet in my coat, got a girl doin’ coke

[Chorus: Future]
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

[Verse 1: Future]
When I poured it, I gave her a dose, said she was already hooked
If you always there for me, that's a rеally good look
I’m changin' up your salary 'cause I'm gettin' to know you
Tell mе your availability, I want all of you
If it's like that, then it's like that, got you lightin' up like lightning
I stack it up, get feisty, can’t sabotage it or ice it
You gon’ tell the world they flawed, thankful for when you nosy
You're a good girl but you’re naughty, don't you never miss out on Pilates
I let you stunt and flex in Bugattis, they don't got me, she with a body
Me and cheap girls stay cheap, we do numbers, stay fly
If it's gettin’ to you, then we fast forward, yeah
Stayin' low like a stash house, yeah
Bando to bando, traphouse, yeah
Made it with nothin', learned to swag out, yeah
Can't be defeated, I got mad sauce, yeah
Why would I front like it ain't my fault?
[Chorus: Future]
Drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turns me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

[Post-Chorus: Future]
She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, ""Jesus Christ,"" but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah

[Interlude: Future]
Hit it all night, we was drinkin' and smokin' (Yeah)
Drinkin' and smokin'

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
I done went from GG to BB to LV
I done fucked with Kiki and Lili and Nini
I text her ""So proud of you"" when I got my B from CC
It is no way that you can know or see the things we see (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
She said that she can tell every time that I lie through my teeth
Plus I know you had somebody else right here in my sheets
Oh, you think you know my body?
Pull up in that Coupe, don't want no shawty
I put rubies on my Rollie, now their eyes bleed
I don't own no ice cream truck, just know my ice freeze
Man, I read her text, she said, ""Girl, I creamed""
Man, I know she duckin' off with her side me
Who you know gon' hit it raw, baby, besides me?
[Chorus: Future]
We drink up and we smoke, but she always do the most
It kinda turn me on the way she lickin' on my stones
My chains on antifreeze, it look like I made a clone
Wanna see you get more sassy, if it bring out better emotions
She called me her God, the way I floated in her ocean

[Post-Chorus: Future]
She called me Messiah, the way I floated in her ocean
Yelled, ""Jesus Christ,"" but I wasn't causin' commotion
Hit it so right, had her soakin' in the ocean, yeah

195,2021,Thomas Rhett,Country Again,"[Verse 1]
I quit huntin' with my daddy, guess I didn't make the time
And it's been a year since I've seen a deer, had a smallmouth on the line
The other day I hooked a monster, and as I reeled him in
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

[Verse 2]
I spent way less time in Nashville, more time in L.A
My back home buddies, they quit callin', thought I had too much on my plate
But last night, we cracked some cold beers and cranked Eric Church to ten
Thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""

[Chorus]
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 3]
I traded in my Silverado, didn't need no four-by-four
I tucked my boots in the back of the closet, they didn't feel like me no more
But I dug 'em out and slipped 'em on, they've been on my feet since then
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Bridge]
Oh-oh
[Chorus]
Yeah, I love me some California, but it sure ain't Tennessee
And my roots down there in Georgia, yeah, they started missin' me
And I wouldn't change the things I've done or the places that I've been
Man, it feels good to be country again

[Verse 4]
I traded sunsets with my wife, for hours on my phone
And even when I was right beside her, I still wasn't really home
But last night, we built a fire, watched the moonlight kiss her skin
I thought, ""Man, it feels good to be country again""
""Man, it feels good to be country again""

[Outro]
Ooh
I saw the light, I found the way home
Thank you Lord, Amen
Man, it feels good to be country again"

197,2021,Morgan Wallen,Wasted On You,"[Verse 1]
I don't always wake up in the mornin'
Pour myself a strong one
Aw, but when I get lonely I do
Your memory gets burnin'
Lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault
Yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
Thinkin' 'bout all I've wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different
My heart wouldn't listen to my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learning the hard way again
That's why I've been wasted on you
[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Bridge]
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in the back
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Chorus]
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent, wasted on you
Wasted on you

[Outro]
Wasted on you, wasted on you"

I can change a tire on the side of a road
Yeah, I know a few things a man oughta know

How to stay when it's tough
How to know you're messin' up a good thing
