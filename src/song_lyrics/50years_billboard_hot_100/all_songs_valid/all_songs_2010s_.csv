1,2010,B.o.B Featuring Hayley Williams,Airplanes,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blacknеss
And when you're staring at the phonе in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah yeah somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shootin' stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
A wish a wish right now"
2,2010,Katy Perry Featuring Snoop Dogg,California Gurls,"[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
Greetings, loved ones
Let's take a journey

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
I know a place where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sipping gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees (Undone)
The boys break their necks
Tryna creep a little sneak peek (At us)

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You could travel the world
But nothing comes close to the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Katy Perry]
California girls, we're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin so hot, we'll melt your popsicle
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
California girls, we're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock
West Coast represent, now put your hands up
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
[Verse 2: Katy Perry]
Sex (Sex) on the beach
We don't mind sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep ​*horn honks*​
Snoop Doggy Dogg on the stereo, oh-oh

Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns (Uh!)
The girl's a freak
She drive a Jeep and live on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play
I love the Bay just like I love L.A
Venice Beach and Palm Springs
Summertime is everything
Homeboys banging out
All that ass hanging out
Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis, no weenies

4,2010,B.o.B Featuring Bruno Mars,Nothin' On You,"[Chorus 1: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi
And I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
(Yeah) Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
I know you feel where I'm comin' from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go)
[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)

Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it
[Pre-Chorus 2: B.o.B]
I've been to London (Yeah), I've been to Paris (Yeah)
Even way out there to Tokyo (Tokyo)
Back home down in Georgia (Yeah) to New Orleans (Yeah)
But you always steal the show (Steal the show)
And just like that, girl, you got me froze (Got me froze)
Like a Nintendo 64 (64)
If you never knew, well now you know
(Know, know, know, know)

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Ha-ha)
They got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hey)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
[Bridge: B.o.B]
Everywhere I go
I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at
Girl you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane
Or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain
And you the one to blame

[Chorus 2: Bruno Mars & B.o.B]
Beautiful girls
All over the world
I could be chasin'
But my time would be wasted (Why?)
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say hi (Hi)
And I might say hey (Hello)
But you shouldn't worry
About what they say (Why?)

I know that we are young, and I know that you may love me
But I just can't be with you like this anymore
Alejandro...

[Verse 1]
She's got both hands in her pocket
And she won't look at you, won't look at you
She hides true love, en su bolsillo
She's got a halo around her finger, around you

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

Stop, please, just let me go
Alejandro, just let me go

But her boyfriend's like her dad, just like her dad
And all those flames that burned before him
Now he's gotta firefight, gotta cool the bad

You know that I love you, boy
Hot, like Mexico, rejoice
At this point, I've gotta choose
Nothing to lose

6,2010,Ke$ha,Your Love Is My Drug,"[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seein' it in my dreams
I'm lookin' down every alley
I'm makin' those desperate calls
I'm stayin' up all night hopin'
Hittin' my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Mama's tellin' me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead
[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug?
Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?
[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug

Rock Mafia

[Verse 1]
For those who don't know me, I can get a bit crazy
Have to get my way, yep
24 hours a day, 'cause I'm hot like that
Every guy, everywhere just gives me mad attention
Like I'm under inspection
I always gets a ten, 'cause I'm built like that

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I go through guys like money flying out the hands
They try to change me, but they realize they can't
And every tomorrow is a day I never plan
If you're gonna be my man, understand

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Verse 2]
If there was a question about my intentions, I'll tell ya
I'm not here to sell ya or tell you to go to hell
I'm not a brat like that
I'm like a puzzle, but all of my pieces are jagged
If you can understand this, we can make some magic
I'm wrong like that
[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know

[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed

[Bridge]
Well, I'm not a trick you play
I'm wired a different way
I'm not a mistake, I'm not a fake, it's set in my DNA
Don't change me, don't change me
Don't change me, don't change me
(I can't be tamed)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go
I wanna to be a part of something I don't know
And if you try to hold me back, I might explode
Baby, by now you should know
[Chorus]
I can't be tamed, I can't be tamed
I can't be blamed, I can't, can't
I can't, can't be tamed
I can't be changed, I can't be tamed
I can't be, can't, I can't be tamed"
8,2010,Eminem,Not Afraid,"[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're tryna get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'ma do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think, I'm doin' this for me
So fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me
I'm tearin' down your balcony
No ifs, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Verse 2]
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm
For you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh""
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow
'Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

[Bridge]
And I just can't keep livin' this way
So startin' today
I'm breakin' out of this cage
I'm standin' up, I'ma face my demons
I'm mannin' up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand-new me
You helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the wringer
But they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead: no more beef lingers
No more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars
I feel amazin', and I'm—
[Chorus]
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (To take a stand)
Everybody (Everybody)
Come take my hand (Come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

Your lipstick stains
On the front lobe of my left-side brains
I knew I wouldn't forget you
And so I went and let you blow my mind
Your sweet moonbeam
The smell of you in every single dream I dream
I knew when we collided
You're the one I have decided who's one of my kind

And I'm always gonna wanna blow your mind

11,2010,Jay-Z + Mr. Hudson,Young Forever,"[Intro: Mr. Hudson]
Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson (Jay-Z)]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young (young)
I wanna be (Aye, may the best of your todays)
Forever young (Be the worst of your tomorrows)
Do you really want to live forever (But we ain't even thinkin' that far)
Forever (ya know what I mean?)
Forever young

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
So we living life like a video (video)
Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine
I'm forever young
[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young (forever young)
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Fear not when, fear not why, fear not much while we're alive
Life is for living, not living uptight, 'till you're somewhere up in the sky
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye's
Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears
Young'll get younger every year, yeah
So if you love me baby, this is how you let me know
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, baby

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Just let it run..
Slamming Bentley doors, hopping outta Porsches
Popping up on Forbes' list, gorgeous (hold up)
Niggas thought I lost it, they be talking bullshit
I be talking more shit, they nauseous (hold up)
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in
Did you get the picture yet?
I'm painting you a portrait of Young

Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever? Forever young"

""Hey, yeah, it's me, just been thinking about everything tonight and I don't know. I just miss you so much
Give me a call back if you can?""

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

Can't stop lookin' at the door

Been there, done that, messed around
I’m having fun, don’t put me down
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet
I won’t let you in again
The messages I’ve tried to send
My information’s just not going in
Burning bridges shore to shore
I break away from something more
I’m not turned on to love until it’s cheap
Been there, done that, messed around
I’m having fun, don’t put me down
I’ll never let you sweep me off my feet

This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof
This time, baby, I’ll be bulletproof

[Verse 2]
I won’t let you turn around
And tell me now I’m much too proud
To walk away from something when it’s dead
Do-do-do your dirty words
Come out to play when you are hurt?
There’s certain things that should be left unsaid
Tick, tick, tick, tick on the watch
And life’s too short for me to stop
Oh, baby, your time is running out
I won’t let you turn around
And tell me now I’m much too proud
All you do is fill me up with doubt

I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, here lady have this
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music
[Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
Oh, every time I close my eyes (What you see, what you see brah?)
I see my name in shiny lights (Uh-ha, uh-ha, yeah, what else?)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad (So bad)
Buy all of the things I never had (Buy everything, ha-ha)

[Intro]
Uh, uh
Young Money
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 1]
Alright, bottles on me, long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball, fuck are y'all thinking?
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
About to go thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I need's a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke, a package of the Swisher's
I did it overnight, it couldn't happen any quicker
""Y'all know them? Well, fuck it, me either""
But point the biggest skeptic out, I'll make him a believer
It wouldn't be the first time I done it, throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones, bitch, I run it
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over

[Verse 2]
One thing 'bout music: when it hits, you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's just what comes with the fame, and I'm ready for that, I'm just saying
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up, Ebert and Roeper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture: turn your widescreen on
If you thinking I'ma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kidding?
Man, nobody's ever done it like I did it, uh
[Chorus]
I know way too many people here right now
That I didn't know last year—who the fuck are y'all?
I swear it feels like the last few nights
We've been everywhere and back
But I just can't remember it all
What am I doing? What am I doing?
Oh yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over
Yeah, that's right—I'm doing me, I'm doing me
I'm living life right now, man
And this what I'ma do 'til it's over, 'til it's over
But it's far from over"

Too many times I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waiting, there's nothing left to do
But give all I have to you and

I better find your loving, I better find your heart
I better find your loving

I've broken my heart so many times, I stopped keeping track
Talk myself in, I talk myself out
I get all worked up, then I let myself down

I tried so very hard not to lose it
I came up with a million excuses
I thought I'd thought of every possibility

[Chorus]
And I know some day that it’ll all turn out
You'll make me work so we can work to work it out
And I promise you, kid, that I'll give so much more than I get
I just haven't met you yet

I might have to wait, I'll never give up
I guess it's half timing and the other half's luck
Wherever you are, whenever it's right
You'll come out of nowhere and into my life

And I know that we can be so amazing
And baby, your love is gonna change me
And now I can see every possibility

But these hand prints on the front steps are mine
Up those stairs, in that little back bedroom
Is where I did my homework and I learned to play guitar
And I bet you didn't know under that live oak
My favorite dog is buried in the yard

[Chorus]
I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

From 'Better Homes and Garden' magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
Nail by nail and board by board

This brokenness inside me might start healing
Out here it’s like I'm someone else
I thought that maybe I could find myself
If I could just come in, I swear I'll leave
Won't take nothing but a memory
From the house that built me

You leave home, you move on and you do the best you can
I got lost in this whole world and forgot who I am

I thought if I could touch this place or feel it
This brokenness inside me might start healing

I dreamed a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving

And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted

But the tigers come at night (But the tigers come at night)
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart (As they tear your hope apart)
As they turn your dream to shame... (To shame...)

That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be

So different now from what it seemed

They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my cash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)

I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033

Caution when it comes to love

And you were strong, and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot
I did

And now, when all is done, there is nothing to say
You've gone and so effortlessly
You've won, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible
Impossible, impossible

Falling out of love is hard
Falling for betrayal is worse
Broken trust and broken hearts
I know, I know
Thinking all you need is there
Building faith on love and words
Empty promises will wear
I know, I know

And now, when all is gone, there is nothing to say
And if you're done with embarrassing me
On your own, you can go ahead, tell them

Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy

I haven't been to church since I don't remember when
Things were going great 'til they fell apart again
So I listened to the preacher as he told me what to do
He said, ""You can't go hatin' others who have done wrong to you
Sometimes we get angry, but we must not condemn
Let the good Lord do His job and you just pray for them""

[Chorus]
I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, honey, I pray for you

[Verse 2]
I'm really glad I found my way to church
'Cause I'm already feelin' better and I thank God for the words
Yeah, I'm gonna take the high road
And do what the preacher told me to do
You keep messin' up and I'll keep prayin' for you

[Bridge]
I pray your tire blows out at a hundred and ten
I pray you pass out drunk with your best friend
And wake up with his and her tattoos

I pray your brakes go out runnin' down a hill
I pray a flower pot falls from a window sill
And knocks you in the head like I'd like to
I pray your birthday comes and nobody calls
I pray you're flyin' high when your engine stalls
I pray all your dreams never come true
Just know wherever you are, near or far
In your house or in your car
Wherever you are, honey, I pray for you

Dragged ya down below, down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever (Peace of mind is less than never)
Hate to twist your mind, but God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed (Burn the world your last endeavor)
Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)
So stand in line while they ink numbers in your head
You're now a slave until the end of time here
Nothing stops the madness turning, haunting, yearning pull the trigger

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare
While your nightmare comes to life

Can't wake up in sweat, 'cause it ain't over yet
Still dancing with your demons (Victim of your own creation)
Beyond the will to fight, where all that's wrong is right
Where hate don't need a reason (Loathing self-assassination)
You've been lied to just to rape you of your sight
And now they have the nerve to tell you how to feel (feel)
So sedated as they medicate your brain
And while you slowly go insane they tell you:
""Given with the best intentions, help you with your complications""

Or you'll end up like the others
Die (Die!), die again (Die!), drenched in sin (Sin!)
With no respect for another, oh!
Down (Down!), feel the fire (Fire!), feel the hate (Hate!)
Your pain is what we desire
Lost (Lost!), hit the wall (Wall!), watch you crawl (Crawl!)
Such a replaceable liar
And I know you hear their voices (Calling from above)
And I know they may seem real (These signals of love)
But our life's made up of choices (Some without appeal)
They took for granted your soul
And it's ours now to steal
As your nightmare comes to life

You should have known the price of evil
And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
No one to call, everybody to fear
Your tragic fate is looking so clear, yeah
Ooh, it's your fucking nightmare"

He'd cuss, kick the dust, saying son it's way too dry
It clouds up in the city, the weather man complains
But where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

Aren’t nothing like a kiss out back in the barn
Ringing out our soaking clothes, riding out a thunderstorm
When tin roof gets to talking, that's the best love we made
Yeah where I come from, rain is a good thing

Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck

Creeks on the rise, roll up your pants
Country girls, they want to cuddle
Kids out playing in a big mud puddle

[Hook]
Rain makes corn, corn makes whiskey
Whiskey makes my baby, feel a little frisky
Back roads are bogging up, my buddies pile up in my truck
We hunt our hunnies down, we take them into town
Start washing all our worries down the drain
Rain is a good thing

[Outro]
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing
Rain is a good thing"

Ginsu or machete, way my pencil move is deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl outta' lezzie
Magazine, mac, benzie keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button then I'm stunting, my roof look like it's ducking

And she always ready to give me that becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club ordered bottles see the sparks in the sky
Will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July

57,2010,Brad Paisley,Water,"[Verse 1]
Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air
I was three years old splashing everywhere
And so began my love affair
With water

[Verse 2]
On a river bank with all my friends
A big old rope tied to a limb
And you’re a big old wuss if you don't jump in
The water

[Chorus]
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Grab your swimming trunks
Ice up that old Igloo
Drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 3]
Daytona Beach on spring break
Eighteen girls up on stage
White t-shirts about to be sprayed
With water

[Break]
Oh let her go boys
[Chorus]
Yeah, when that summer sun starts to beating down
And you don't know what to do
Just go and grab someone you want to see in a bathing suit
And drive until the map turns blue

[Verse 4]
You can stay right there when the daylights gone
Play truth or dare and it won’t take long
'Fore you and her got nothing on
But water
All you really need this time of year
Is a pair of shades and ice cold beer
And a place to sit somewhere near
Water"
58,2010,Carrie Underwood,Undo It,"[Verse 1]
I should've known by the way you passed me by
There was something in your eyes, and it wasn't right
I should've walked, but I never had the chance
Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Now I only have myself to blame
For falling for your stupid games
I wish my life could be the way
It was before I saw your face

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

[Post-Chorus]
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Now your photos don't have a picture frame
And I never say your name, and I never will
And all your things, well, I threw 'em in the trash
And I'm not even sad

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now you only have yourself to blame
For playing all those stupid games
You're always gonna be the same
Oh no, you'll never change

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na na

You want my future, you can't have it
I'm still trying to erase you from my past
I need you gone so fast

[Chorus]
You stole my happy, you made me cry
Took the lonely and took me for a ride
And I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it
You had my heart, now, I want it back
I'm starting to see everything you lack
Boy, you blew it, you put me through it
I wanna uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-undo it

Something 'bout the way she’s wearing her dress a little tighter
Something 'bout the way she’s starin', she’s lookin' to start a fire
Something 'bout the way she’s dancin' and drinkin' chill Patron
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long

[Chorus]
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

[Verse 2]
Something 'bout the way she’s blushin' you can tell she isn’t sure
Let you know she’s up to something she’s never done before
Tonight she wants to hold a stranger but not the one at home
If she’s lonely now she won’t be lonely long

[Chorus]
Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long

[Bridge]
If I had a woman like that
Man I’d let her know
I’d hold her tight
I’d hold her close
Do anything, do everything to let her know
She’d never ever be alone

Heaven help the fool who did her wrong
It’s too late, too bad, she’s too far gone
He should’ve thought of that before he left her all alone
If she’s lonely now, Lord if she’s lonely now
If she’s lonely now, she won’t be lonely long"

Jessie is a friend
Yeah, I know he's been a good friend of mine
But lately something's changed that ain't hard to define
Jessie's got himself a girl and I want to make her mine

And she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late at night

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that

I play along with the charade
There doesn't seem to be a reason to change
You know, I feel so dirty when they start talking cute
I wanna tell her that I love her
But the point is probably moot

Cause she's watching him with those eyes
And she's loving him with that body I just know it
And he's holding her in his arms late at night

You know, I wish that I had Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman like that
Like Jessie's girl
I wish that I had Jessie's girl
Where can I find a woman
Where can I find a woman like that
And I'm looking in the mirror all the time
Wondering what she don't see in me
I've been funny, I've been cool with the lines
Ain't that the way love supposed to be
Tell me, where can I find a woman like that!

I never let you down, I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard I'm gonna ball, on them squares I float
Quarter-million dollar cars everywhere I go
I know in the lead it may seem he might be
But no matter what they doing, they don’t do it like me
Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back!

[Verse 1]
Strike a match, catch a fire
Any moment I decide that's enough of all your lies
Boy, your buzz just died
Step inside, super-fly, to the shoes in their coupe
Then exit out with all the bitches like we always do
My desire to retire grow with every new crew
Cause these guys, they don't ride like my nigga, you too
Tight jeans, funny haircuts dancing on the screen
There's a drought of real niggas in the game, so it seems
Just pretend to holla, pimping, give the shit a black eye eye
Next he say he trapping in my head I’m like: ""why?""
Be yourself; you ain't got a pimp bone in your body
I can tell you ain't never bought a key or caught a body
Nigga probably just seen Wayne, Gucci Mane
Me and Boosie all go to prison
Now he flipping hoes, every nigga tripping
Listen dude, for you that ain't in the cards
Thank the power's in the guns
But overall it's in your heart
Nowadays I don’t know what's up with niggas in the A
Guess he think he in the game but he really in the way:
Violating. I was having conversations in the joint
But guess who done it? And I promised I would put you on point
I’m disappointed in you, dogg, you ain't hold it down at all
But I ain't going at your jaw, just going to show you how to ball
Standing tall through the storm, on the yard or in the dorms
Cats in prison who expecting me to represent for them
[Hook]
I never let you down, I’ma shine on sight
Keep your mind on your grind and off of mines, alright?
Hard I'm gonna ball, on them squares I float

Like a G I hold it down for the town I’m at
In a flash like that, recognize I'm back!

Strike a match, catch a fire, see T.I. add gas
What's a Molotov cocktail that never break a glass
Still I am, partnas want to come for me you better bring it
I ain’t mad I forgive them, God I know they ain't mean it
Yeah I seen it all before, hate I'm popping and they ain't
Wrack they brain try to think how to stop it and they can’t
Ain't that lame, but then that hatred manifest to pure malice
I’m no longer being callous, I’m gonna let you niggas have it
Won’t be satisfied until somebody dies and I'm patiently waiting on
Me and the reaper on a first name basis now
I’m a let you make it now, stay totally out the way for you
But know that we could take it any place you wanna take it too
Hating in your blood, Cuz. Yes, it’s just too late for you
All I could do is pray for you or organize a wake for you
Your choice, clearly I ain't hearing your voice
Keep it up an Imma send you ass to chill wit Aunt Joyce
Hey, you can have the bottom, partner I'm up in the sky box
I got shit locked down nigga why stop now
I'm so above you, hover over suckers why drop down
I’m so profound, it goes down, and I never let you down

I never let you down, I’ma shine on sight

Put us together and you have to hit the rewind
See, you give me a purpose, now I'm getting nervous
That my heart will never sing again

They knew us from the Virgin Islands to the U.K
See, we was on our way to the platinum and gold
Never thought that you'd go, but you did, yeah
Yeah, you did

70,2010,Rascal Flatts,Unstoppable,"[Verse 1]
So, so you made a lot of mistakes
Walked down the road a little sideways
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall
Yeah, you've had a pocketfull of regrets
Pull you down faster than a sunset
Hey, it happens to us all
When the cold, hard rain just won't quit
And you can't see your way out of it

[Chorus]
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable

[Verse 2]
Love, it can weather any storm
Bring you back to being born, again
Oh, it's the helping hand
When you needed it most
The lightouse shining on the coast
That never goes dim
When your heart is full of doubt
As you think that there's no way out
[Chorus]
You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken
Get on your knees and dig down deep
You can do what you think is impossible
Keep on believing, don't give in
It'll come and make you whole again
It always will, it always does
Love is unstoppable
It's unstoppable

Like a river keeps on rollin'
Like a north wind blowin'
Don't it feel good knowin'

You find your faith that's been lost and shaken
You take back what's been taken

Walked down the road a little sideways

I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks, trick-or-treating the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you tricking or what?
Flow, flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white tee, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me ""Hey Nicki, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?""
As-Salaam Alaykum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
'Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've done penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Lear
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier
V.I.P. rosé; you can have a beer
'Cause honey when you getting money you don't have a care

Four chick foursomes, skin color's mocha
Sally and Sonia, put the pussies on my totem
Pole vault stroke 'em uhh, strike ya like bowling
Now open like you yawning, it's 6 in the morning
Sleeping on me, probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fucking August, I'm awesome
I'm awesome: repeat it to ya grandma, and uncles
Or mothers, Tyga's no dad but I'm the motherfucker
Motherfuckers, this the last supper
Look, no hands, I'ma bread cuffer
I don't dare love her, I'ma daredevil
I don't fear nothing motherfucker, Young Money!

Fuck around and never get Roger back

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in!
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet, so pass it like Brett
We sip side of mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than four quarters, we call it sudden death
I'm a beast. You a pet
AK long neck. Keith Sweat, haha!
Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me
I'm mountain high Colorado in this bitch with me
Flow crazy 7:30, you just 6:50
Twenty bullets from the chopper take the roof off
Laughing to the bank, I'm a goofball
Hahaha! It's YM
And we at your neck, like a violin
It's our world, we make it spin
And y'all the prey- amen!

Now Roger that, Roger that
Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a rat
Fuc-fuck around and never get Roger back!!

74,2010,Kenny Chesney,Ain't Back Yet,"[Verse 1]
I heard a song about a rambling man
Bought a guitar and I started a band
I got a gig at the local Am Vet
I was gone and I am not back yet

69 bored, out and jacked up
A quarter mile that was all it was
I burned the cool off of that Corvette
And I was gone and I am not back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black and white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever

[Verse 2]
She was a cut offs pepper sauce queen
Man, we were matches and gasoline
First taste of love never will forget
I was gone and I am not back yet
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet

[Chorus]
Looking back at the moments, black white
I wouldn't change a thing that changed my life
For the worse, for the better
Man, I was gone, gone forever
The laughs, the smiles, the trials, the tears
It's hard to hate what got me here
What got me here
[Verse 3]
She was a straight out of Hollywood smile
We missed it all by a country mile
Went out one night for some cigarettes
And I was gone and I am not back yet

[Hook] [x2]
I was gone, gone and I am not back yet
I was gone and I am not back
I am not back, am not back yet"

You're everything to me, hey
The air that I breathe, oh
A sign so I'll see, oh Lord

76,2010,Muse,Neutron Star Collision (Love Is Forever),"[Verse 1]
I was searching
You were on a mission
Then our hearts combined like
A neutron star collision
I have nothing left to lose
You took your time to choose
Then we told each other
With no trace of fear that...

[Chorus 1]
Our love would be forever
And if we die
We die together
And lie, I said never
'Cause our love would be forever

[Verse 2]
The world is broken
Halos fail to glisten
You try to make a difference but
No one wants to listen
Hail, the preachers, fake and proud
Their doctrines will be cloud
Then they'll dissipate
Like snowflakes in an ocean
[Chorus 2]
Love is forever
And we'll die, we'll die together
And lie, I said never
'Cause our love could be forever

[Bridge]
Now I've got nothing left to lose
You take your time to choose
I can tell you now without a trace of fear

[Chorus 3]
That my love will be forever
And we'll die, we'll die together
Lie, I will never
'Cause our love will be forever"
77,2010,Timbaland Featuring Drake,Say Something,"[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you we a catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?
[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?
[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa"

86,2010,Lee Brice,Love Like Crazy,"They called him crazy when they started out
Said seventeen's too young to know what love's about
They've been together fifty-eight years now
That's crazy

He brought home sixty-seven bucks a week
He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy
They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget
Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

Always treat your woman like a lady
Never get to old to call her baby
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when they started out
They've been together fifty-eight years now
Ain't that crazy?"

I ride east every other Friday but if I had it my way
The day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

[Chorus]
So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

[Verse 2]
A day might come and you'll realize that if you could see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son please don't mistake me for a man that didn't care at all

[Chorus]
And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why, That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around, right at the Georgia line and I count the days and the miles back home to you on that Highway 20 ride

[Outro]
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
On that Highway 20 ride"

Love takes the patience of Job
That's what my Mama always said
Faith is the belief in something more than what you know
That's what the Good Book says
You got to play the cards you got
Who knows what fate is holding
At times you got to go without knowing where you're going

That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos
I keep on loving you

Lord knows we've had our share of fights
Our sleepless nights, our ups and downs
We've had plenty and then some of baby-I'm-gones and turnarounds
Sometimes I swear it might be easier to throw in the towel
Someday we're going to look back
Say look at us now

[Chorus]
That's why I keep on loving you
I keep on loving you
Through the baby don't-leave-mes
And never-will-agains
And I-promise-tos

Imagine a dirt road full of potholes
With a creek bank and some cane poles catching channel cat

Picture a small town with an old hound
Laying out front of the courthouse
While the old men chew the fat
I'm a little more country than that

'Cause girl I'm I'm not the kind to two time or play games behind your back

Think of a Hank song from days gone
With a steel rod that's so strong,  sends chills up your back

If you want a brick home in a school zone
With the doors locked and alarms on
Girl, you're way off track
I'm a little more country than that

I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six

You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

It must have been the way

That takes me to another planet

Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

They play it safe, are quick to assassinate what they do not understand. They move in packs ingesting more and more fear with every act of hate on one another. They feel most comfortable in groups, less guilt to swallow. They are us. This is what we have become. Afraid to respect the individual. A single person within a circumstance can move one to change. To love herself. To evolve"

Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Take advantage of tonight (Yeah)
'Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless (Yeah)
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin', hustlers move aside
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan (Woo)
Put it on my life, baby, I'll make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (Dale)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Nayer]
Tonight, I want all of you tonight
Give me everything tonight

I want you tonight, I want you to stay, I want you tonight
Grab somebody sexy, tell 'em hey (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)
Give me everything tonight (Hey)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Reach for the stars, and if you don't grab them
At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, 'cause if you slip
I'm gon' fall on top of your girl, haha
What I'm involved with is deeper than the Masons, baby baby
And it ain't no secret
My granny's from Cuba, but I'm an American idol
Gettin' money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby (Baby) I'll make you feel right, baby (Baby)
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (Dale)
[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Excuse me (Excuse me)

I'm a legend, I'm irreverent, I be reverend
I'll be so fa-a-a-a-a-ar up
We don't give a fuh-uh-uck
Welcome to the danger zone
Step into the fantasy
You are not invited to the other side of sanity
They callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut
Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot

[Verse 1: Katy Perry]
You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing
They say be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

[Pre-Chorus: Katy Perry]
You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your lasers

I know a bar out in Mars
Where they driving spaceships instead of cars

Getting stupid high straight up out the jars
Pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck

Then I'ma probe you
See I abducted you
So I tell you what to do
I tell you what to do, what to do, what to do

[Chorus: Katy Perry]

Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything

I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chillin' in my Snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man

Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ugh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, ""what's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you, 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it
[Bridge: Drake]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done

Ugh! I’m burning purple flowers, it’s burning my chest (Ugh)
I bury the most cash and burning the rest (Stuntin')
Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo!)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo!)
Ugh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair
So, yeah, we on one, the feeling ain’t fair (Khaled)
And it’s double-M G until I get the chair, chyeah

I walk around the club, fuck everybody
And all my niggas got that heat, I feel like Pat Riley
Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listening—nigga, what money?
I’m a made nigga, I should dust something
You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant
You a sellout, but I ain't buying
Chopper dissect a nigga like science
Put an end to your world like the Mayans
This a celebration, bitches: Mazel tov
It’s a slim chance I fall: Olive Oyl

But, I know when love is real
By the way my heart starts pounding
When I look into your eyes
I might look a little silly
Standing with my arms stretched open wide

[Chorus]
I love you this big
Eyes have never seen this big
No-one's ever dreamed this big
And I'll spend the rest of my life
Explaining what words cannot describe but, I'll try
I love you this big

[Verse 2]
I'll love you to the moon and back
I'll love you all the time
Deeper than the ocean
And higher than the pines
Because girl, you do something to me
Deep down in my heart
I know I look a little crazy
Standing with my arms stretched all apart
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
So much bigger than I ever dreamed my heart ever would
I love you this big
And I'd write your name in stars across the sky
If I could, I would

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Have you ever had the feelin' that you was bein' had?
Don't that shit there make you mad? They treat you like a slave
Put chains all on your soul and put whips up on your back
They be lyin' through they teeth, hope you slip up off your path
I don't switch up, I just laugh (Ha ha) put my kicks up on they desk
Unaffected by they threats, then get busy on they ass
See that's how that Chi-Town made me
That's how my daddy raised me
That glitterin' may not be gold, don't let nobody play me
If you are my homeboy, you never have to pay me
Gon' and put your hands up, when times is hard, you stand up
L-U-P the man, 'cause the brand that the fans trust
So even if they ban us, they'll never slow my plans up

One in the air for the people ain't here
Two in the air for the father that's there
Three in the air for the kids in the ghetto
Four for the kids that don't wanna be there
None for the niggas tryna hold them back
Five in the air for the teachers not scared
To tell those kids that's livin' in the ghetto
That the niggas holdin' back that the world is theirs
Yeah, yeah, the world is yours, I was once that little boy
Terrified of the world, now I'm on a world tour
I would give up everything, even start a world war
For these ghetto girls and boys I'm rappin' round the world for
Africa to New York, Haiti then I detour
Oakland out to Auckland, Gaza Strip to Detroit
Say hip-hop only destroy, tell 'em look at me, boy
I hope your son don't have a gun and never be a d-boy

So no matter what you been through, no matter what you into
No matter what you see when you look outside your window
Brown grass or green grass, picket fence or barbed wire
Never ever put them down, you just lift your arms higher
Raise 'em 'til your arms tired, let 'em know you here
That you strugglin', survivin', that you gon' persevere
Yeah, ain't nobody leavin', nobody goin' home

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)

Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)

Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy

Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said ""shoot 'em"", and I said ""okay""
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""

119,2011,Lauren Alaina,Like My Mother Does,"[Verse 1]
People always say I have a laugh
Like my mother does
Guess that makes sense
She taught me how to smile
When things get rough
I've got her spirit, and she's always got my back
When I look at her, I think I wanna be just like that

[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

[Verse 2]
I never met a stranger
I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly
And she can walk away
When she's had enough
She sees everybody for who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She helped me get this far
[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
When I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

[Bridge]
She's a rock, she is grace
She's an angel
She's my heart and soul
She does it all

[Chorus]
When I love
I give it all I've got
Like my mother does
And when I'm scared
I bow my head and pray
Like my mother does
When I'm weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does
Like my mother does

I'm starting to look like my mother does"

Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you’re listening now
They say they ain't heard nothing like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screaming 'til they hear you out

[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change
And I’m on my way

Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh  (oh)

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilist ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn’t going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming until they hear you out

[Hook: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away, a message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go, but I will never change

Woke up in London yesterday
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
Don't really know how I got here
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to whatever we want
We're young enough to say

[Chorus]
Oh, this has gotta be the good life
This has gotta be the good life
This could really be a good life, good life
Say oh, got this feeling that you can't fight
Like this city is on fire tonight
This could really be a good life
A good, good life

[Verse 2]
To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A., they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Colorado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories, but please tell me-e-e-e
What there's to complain about

When you're happy like a fool
Let it take you over
When everything is out
You got to take it in

Hopelessly, I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly, I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly, I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cause hopelessly, the hope is we have
So much to feel good about

Oh, this has gotta be the good life

Girl, I been thinking 'bout us
And you know I ain't good at this stuff
These feelings piling up won't give me no rest
This might come out a little crazy
A little sideways, yeah maybe
I don't know how long it'll take me but I'll do my best

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day
I'll be your shade tree
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Yeah, that came out a little country
But every word was right on the money
And I got you smiling honey right back at me
Now hold on cause I aren’t done
There's more where that came from
Well you know I'm just having fun, but seriously

If you'll be my Louisiana
I'll be your Mississippi

I'll be your Conway Twitty
You'll be my sugar, baby
I'll be your sweet iced tea
You'll be my honeysuckle
I'll be your honey bee

Your kiss just said it all
I'm glad we had this talk
Nothing left to do but fall in each other’s arms
I could have said ""I love you""
Could have wrote you a line or two
Baby, all I know to do is speak right from the heart

[Chorus 1]
You'll be my soft and sweet
I'll be your strong and steady
You'll be my glass of wine
I'll be your shot of whiskey
You'll be my sunny day

Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing
[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 2]
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

[Chorus]
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Let's ride
Yeah, I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right

Made a wrong turn, no, that was terrible. Nope. Wow, I don't even know what note that was. I think I just invented a note. You’re welcome. Haha. Okay, let me try that again

[Verse 1]
Made a wrong turn, once or twice
Dug my way out, blood and fire
Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss “Knowing it's all good”
It didn’t slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated
Look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

You’re so mean (You’re so mean)
When you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voices)
In your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead
So complicated, look how we all make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I’ve done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh

Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please
Don’t you ever ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that?
Why do I do that?

[Chorus]
Yes, you're perfect to me
Pretty, pretty please
Don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than, less than perfect
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me, yes
We're perfect, oh, we're perfect to me
Pretty, pretty please
If you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me"

It's like a storm
That cuts a path
It breaks your will
It feels like that
You think you're lost
But you're not lost
On your own
You're not alone

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight
And I won't let go

It hurts my heart
To see you cry
I know it's dark
This part of life
Oh, it finds us all
And we're too small
To stop the rain
Oh, but when it rains

I will stand by you
I will help you through
When you've done all you can do
And you can't cope
I will dry your eyes
I will fight your fight
I will hold you tight

Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow

Reach down underneath and tear down all the walls?
Will we ever have a happy ending
Or will we forever only be pretending?
Will we a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways, a-ah, a-ah-lways be pretending?

142,2011,Brad Paisley Featuring Alabama,Old Alabama,"[Verse 1]
She’d rather wear a pair of cutoff jeans
Than a fancy evening dress
And with her windows rolled down and her hair all blown around, she’s a hot southern mess
She’ll take a beer over white wine
And a campfire over candle light
And when it comes to love, oh her idea of a romantic night

[Chorus]
Is listening to old Alabama, driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight at the Right Time of the Night
And she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee!

[Verse 2]
And now we’re rolling down an old back road
I got the steering wheel in one hand
We’ll find a hideaway where she and I can play
In Mother Nature’s band

[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to old Alabama
Parked somewhere in Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and it Feels So Right
And it’s Love In The First Degree-ee-Eee!

[Verse 3]
Forget about Sinatra or Coltrane
Or some old Righteous Brothers song
Even Barry White ain't  going to work tonight
If you really want to turn her on
Play some back home come on music
That comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feeling
Because that’s where music has to start
[Chorus]
Now we’re listening to Old Alabama
And we’re driving through Tennessee
A little Dixieland Delight and It Feels So Right
And its Love in the First Degree

Yeah’ you know we’re listening to Old Alabama (old Alabama) driving through Tennessee (Tennessee)
A little Why Lady Why at The Right Time of The Night
Oh and she can’t keep her hands off of me-ee-Eee

[Outro]
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Oh, play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play me some old Alabama
Play me some old Alabama
Won’t you play-ee-ay-ay
Yeee-haw!!!"

144,2011,Zac Brown Band Featuring Jimmy Buffett,Knee Deep,"[Verse 1]
Going to put the the world away for a minute
Pretend I don't live in it
Sunshine going to wash my blues away
Had sweet love but I lost it
She got too close so I farted
Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way

[Chorus]
Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Verse 2: Jimmy Buffett]
Wrote a note said be back in a minute
Bought a boat and I sailed off in it
Don't think anybody going to miss me anyway
Mind on a permanent vacation
The ocean is my only medication
Wishing my condition ain't ever going to go away

[Chorus]
Now I'm knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise
[Bridge]
This champagne shore washing over me
It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea
One day you could be as lost as me
Change your geography
Maybe you might be

[Chorus]
Knee deep in the water somewhere
Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair
Only worry in the world is the tide going to reach my chair
Sunrise, there's a fire in the sky
Never been so happy
Never felt so high
And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise

[Outro]
Come on in the water's nice
Find yourself a little slice
Grab a back, pack it light
You never know until you try
When you lose yourself
You find the key to paradise"

Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the catfish swimmin' down deep in the creek

Tangle me up like grandma's yarn

Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all, but you never give
Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? (Ooh)

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is

I'd catch a grenade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw my hand on a blade for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'd jump in front of a train for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You know I'd do anything for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh

Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, ""Hey"" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face, then rip the brakes out my car

Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash; yes, you did!

Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby

If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby

Tomorrow I'm gonna leave here
I'm gonna let you go and walk away

And tomorrow, I'm gonna listen
To that voice of reason inside my head
Telling me that we're no good

But, tonight I'm gonna give in one last time
Rock you strong in these arms of mine

It ain't complicated
Well, I've grown to hate it
I never liked the taste of crow
But baby, I ate it

[Verse 2]
They tried to warn me
They said that you were ornery
So don't bring me those big brown eyes
And tell me that you're sorry

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you might as well throw gasoline
On a fire
The way you lie

[Chorus]
You lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
Well, you lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
The way you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
[Verse 3]
That ain't my perfume
I bet she had a curfew
You told me you were out with the boys
And baby, I believed you

[Verse 4]
So why you lookin' so nervous?
You know you're gonna deserve this
I oughta kill you right now
And do the whole wide world a service

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, my daddy's gonna straighten you out
Like a piece of wire
Like a piece of wire
The way you lie

[Chorus]
You lie like the man with the slick back hair
Who sold me that Ford
Well, you lie like the pine tree in the back yard
After last month's storm
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes way too natural to you
The way you lie
[Bridge]
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna drive
To the big ol' muddy river
I'm gonna park my car in the middle of the mile-long
Bridge
And then I'm not gonna cry-y
Well, maybe just a little
Then I'm gonna slip off the ring
That you put on my finger
Give it a big ol' fling
And watch it sink
Down, down, down
And there it's gonna lie
Until the Lord comes back around

[Chorus]
Because you lie like a priceless Persian rug
On a rich man's floor
You lie like a coon dog basking in the sunshine
On my porch
Well, you lie like a penny in the parking lot
At the grocery store
It just comes so dang natural to you
The way you lie
The way you lie

Well, it's what you do
It's who you are"
155,2011,Keith Urban,Without You,"[Verse 1]
I loved you since the very first day
When I caught you looking my way
I smiled and just knew it
And up until you came along
And no one ever heard my song
Now it's climbing with a bullet

It's nice to have someone so honestly devoted
But when it's said and done girl I hope you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea

[Verse 2]
Along comes a baby girl
And suddenly my little world
Just got a whole lot bigger, yes it did
And people that I barely knew
They love me because I'm part of you
Man it's tough to figure
How two souls could be miles from one another
But still you and me somehow found each other

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Oh Without you yea yea

[Verse 3]
Without you I'd survive
But I'd have to have the notion
That I could live this life
Just going through the motions

[Pre-Chorus]
The traveling, the singing, it don't mean nothing without you
The fast cars, the guitars, they are all just second to
This life, this love that you and I've been dreaming of for so long
Would all be as good as gone without you

[Chorus]
Without you
Without you baby baby baby without you

So now it's up to you
For both of us
Now it's up to you

[KURT]
I've heard it said that people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led to those who help us most to grow
If we let them, and we help them in return
Well, I don't know if I believe that's true
But I know I'm who I am today because I knew you

Like a comet pulled from orbit as it passes a sun
Like a stream that meets a boulder halfway through the wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good

[RACHEL]
It well may be that we will never meet again in this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me is made of what I learned from you
You'll be with me like a handprint on my heart
And now whatever way our stories end
I know you have rewritten mine by being my friend
Like a ship blown from its mooring by a wind off the sea
Like a seed dropped by a skybird in a distant wood
Who can say if I've been changed for the better
But because I knew you

[KURT]
Because I knew you

[KURT & RACHEL]
I have been changed for good

[RACHEL]
And just to clear the air
I ask forgiveness for the things I've done you blame me for

[KURT]
But then I guess we know there's blame to share

[KURT & RACHEL]
And none of it seems to matter anymore

[KURT & (RACHEL)]
Like a comet pulled from orbit (Like a ship blown from its mooring)
As it passes a sun (By a wind off the sea)
Like a stream that meets a boulder (Like a seed dropped by a bird)
Halfway through the wood (In the wood)
[KURT & RACHEL]
Who can say if I've been changed for the better?
I do believe I have been changed for the better

[KURT]
And because I knew you

[RACHEL]
Because I knew you

Because I knew you

158,2011,Dr. Dre Featuring Eminem & Skylar Grey,I Need A Doctor,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man"", 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor

I ain't the kind you take home to mama
I ain't the kind to wear no ring

Sometimes I smoke cigarettes

And I just smile and say, ""God Bless""

But said he loved me anyway
My brother got the brains of the family
So I thought I'd learn to sing

'Cause I heard Jesus, he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand a heart like mine

I'll fly away, from it all one day
And I'll fly away
These are the days that I will remember
When my names called on a roll
He'll meet me with two long-stemmed glasses
And make a toast to me coming home

'Cause I heard Jesus, he drank wine
And I bet we'd get along just fine
He could calm a storm and heal the blind
And I bet he'd understand
Understand a heart like mine

161,2011,Justin Moore,If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away,"[Verse 1]
Every day I drive to work across Flint River Bridge
A hundred yards from the spot
Where me and grandpa fished
There's a piece of his old fruit stand
On the side of Sawmill Road
He'd be there peeling peaches
If it was twenty years ago
And what I wouldn't give
To ride around in that old truck with him

[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far away

[Verse 2]
I'd hug all three of those girls
We lost from the class of '99
And I'd find my bird dog Bo
And take him hunting one more time
I'd ask Hank why he took those pills back in '53
And Janis to sing the second verse of
""Me and Bobby McGee""
Sit on a cloud and visit for a while
It'd do me good just to see them smile
[Chorus]
If heaven wasn't so far away
I'd pack up the kids and go for the day
Introduce them to their grandpa
Watch them laugh at the way he talks
I'd find my long lost cousin John
The one we left back in Vietnam
Show him a picture of his daughter now
She's a doctor and he'd be proud
Then tell him we'd be back in a couple of days
In the rear view mirror we'd all watch them wave
Yeah, and losing them wouldn't be so hard to take
If heaven wasn't so far

If heaven wasn't so far
If heaven wasn't so far away
So far away
So far away"

Chest to chest (Chest to chest)
Nose to nose (Nose to nose)
Palm to palm
We were always just that close (Just that close)
Wrist to wrist (Wrist to wrist)
Toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Verse 2]
Eye to eye (Eye to eye)
Cheek to cheek (Cheek to cheek)
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me (Oh, next to me)
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
[Pre-Chorus]
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?

[Chorus]
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

[Bridge]
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

You were too bad for a little square town
With your hip-hop hat and your pants on the ground
Heard you cussed out mamma, pushed daddy around
Before you took off in his car
Here you are runnin' these dirty old streets
Tattoo on your neck, fake gold on your teeth
Got the hood here snowed, but you can't fool me
We both know who you are

[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty
Little house little kids little small town story
If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy

[Verse 2]
I was haulin' this hay, to Uncle Joe's farm
I thought of us bare foot kids in the yard
Man it seems we were just catchin' snakes in the barn
Now you're caught up in this mess
I can use a little help unloadin' these bales
I can keep ya pretty busy with a hammer and a nail
Ain't a glamorous life, but it'll keep you outta jail
And not worry us all to death
[Chorus]
Homeboy you're gonna wish one day you were sittin' on the gate of a truck by the lake
With your high school flame on one side
Ice cold beer on the other
Ain't no shame in a blue collar forty

If you don't ever do anything else for me
Just do this for me brother
Come on home, boy
Come on home, boy

Homeboy... Yeah...
You can't hold back the hands of time
Mamas goin' grey and so is Daddy's mind

Cut the music up
A little louder

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryning put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love
[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Bridge]
See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual
[Chorus]
You see you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner trying put it together
How to love, how to love"

172,2011,Jake Owen,Barefoot Blue Jean Night,"[Verse 1]
A full moon shining bright
Edge of the water; we were feeling alright
Back down a country road
The girls are always hot, and the beer is ice cold
Cadillac, horns on the hood
My buddy Frankie had his dad hook him up good
Girls smile when we roll by
They hop in the back, and we cruise to the river side

[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

[Verse 2]
Blue eyes and auburn hair
Sittin' lookin' pretty by the fire in a lawn chair
New to town, and new to me
Her ruby red lips was sippin' on sweet tea
Shot me in love like a shootin' star
So, I grabbed a beer and my ol' guitar
Then we sat around till the break of dawn
Howlin' and singin' our favorite song
[Chorus]
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night
Never gonna grow up
Never gonna slow down
We were shinin' like lighters in the dark
In the middle of a rock show
We were doin' it right
We were comin' alive
Yeah, caught up in a Southern summer, a barefoot, blue jean night

Barefoot, blue jean night

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

How long will it take
Before these feelings go away?
How much longer must I wait?
And are there any real answers, anyway?
Yeah

Your silence in a crowded room
Louder than the loudest tune
I hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above""
But I can't
I can't

I miss you in everything
I was too fast travelling
To take you in
I know that silence is no crime
Just wish I could hear you fill it up
One more time
Yeah, I know what you'd say to me
Exactly what you'd say to me
I still hang on every word

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes up
And you said, ""Rise above
Yourself""

In a time of treason
Is there time for trust?
Where there's no them
Only us
Is there time for reason?
Has your heart had enough?
Is it time to let go
And rise above?

And you said, ""Rise above""
Open your eyes to love
And you said, ""Rise above

She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

[Verse 2]
At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame

Born for leavin'

Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

[Alternate Chorus]
Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I've got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again

I can't wait 'til then"
176,2011,Taylor Swift,The Story Of Us,"[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me?
Yeah, and I don't know what to say
Since the twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah?
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, ""fuck it""
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit

We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad

Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

I walk downtown in my broke down shoes
To the side street pub with the bar band blues
Take a backseat at the front door table
Order me a Bud and a shot of Black Label
Closed this place down once again
Sitting here wishing you would walk right in
Down my shot, shoot my beer
I have to got to go home but I cannot stay here
It is a short, short walk down to my second home
But that boulevard gets longer when you are walking back alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me
I keep thinking I will come home
One day and find you

[Chorus]
Long as I got that neon light
Shining like a beacon in the night
I know I can make it downtown by myself
Because if you do not know where you are going
You might end up somewhere else

[Verse 2]
Kicking off my shoes, tumbling through the front door
Knowing too well the kind of night I am in for
Cubs got beat again on Sports Center
My bedroom is cold as my TV dinner
One more cigarette and I will kill the light
And I will lay there wishing you were sleeping at my side

And I do not know where you might be
Wherever it is, it will be without me

Gave the bitch a ride, got the Continental dusty
Trust me, I keep a couple hundred in the duff'-B
Couple wet wipes case a bum try to touch me, ew

Bitch talk slick, I'ma have to terminate her
These little nappy-headed hoes need a perminator
You my seed, I'll spray you with the germinator (Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh)
Move back, bugs
Matter fact, you know the queen could use a back rub (Ah)
If you could turn back time, Cher
You used to be here, now you're gone, Nair

So sad to see you go so soon
I know that you ain't comin' back
In the beginnin' everything was cool
Toward the end of it all, it's all bad
I know I played my part in making it what it is
And I know that you did the same
I guess I'm up outta here
I'm movin' on again, I sure that you will understand
I played by the rules, You played by the game
I couldn't have stayed, It's easier to say
Cause I was by your side when you went through the pain
I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away

[Chorus]
And every minute you're gone, I missin' you so
I can't believe that you're far away
Can't get you out of my mind
Boy you're out of my life
I can't believe that you're far away
And it would be different, if you could here me baby
Now that you're so far away -ay -ay -ay

Tear stains on my pillow
Tryin' to forget ya
Don't know what I'm gonna do
Four day and countin', I've been layin' here
Starin' myself in the mirror all alone in my room
I can't feel this way again
Gotta think with my head
Cause my heart is what go me here
So hurt from what you done
More than enough reasons for me to move on
Cause I gave you my word, you put you're trust in me
Supposed to be the one
To give you what you need
I was by your side when we were meant to be
Guess it doesn't matter now that you're so
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I had known Sunday morning, that you would be gone
I would've never come home
I wouldn't have answered my phone to hear the voice had a tone
I knew that something was wrong
The cop's the one who had told me that you were alone inside an empty room
Identified you as my baby
Oh my baby, so far away

Please come back I miss you baby

Will you ever need me
Without you I can't go on

Just have to walk away sometimes
We’re gonna do what lovers do
We’re gonna have a fight or two
But I ain’t ever changin’ my mind

Silly woman, come here, let me hold you
Have I told you lately?
I love you like crazy, girl

186,2011,Mumford & Sons,The Cave,"[Verse 1]
It's empty in the valley of your heart
The sun, it rises slowly as you walk
Away from all the fears
And all the faults you've left behind
The harvest left no food for you to eat
You cannibal, you meat-eater, you see
But I have seen the same
I know the shame in your defeat

[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I have other things to fill my time
You take what is yours and I'll take mine
Now let me at the truth
Which will refresh my broken mind
So tie me to a post and block my ears
I can see widows and orphans through my tears
I know my call despite my faults
And despite my growing fears
[Chorus]
But I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again

[Verse 3]
So come out of your cave walking on your hands
And see the world hanging upside down
You can understand dependence
When you know the maker's land

[Chorus 2]
So make your siren's call
And sing all you want
I will not hear what you have to say
'Cause I need freedom now
And I need to know how
To live my life as it's meant to be

[Chorus/Outro]
And I will hold on hope
And I won't let you choke
On the noose around your neck
And I'll find strength in pain
And I will change my ways
I'll know my name as it's called again"

Depression and unemployment
This song's for you

Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart
And it feels like a cold night
Today's a new day, but where are my blue skies
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me?
Tell me it's alright

I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain
Fell from heaven like a shower

I know God is working so I smile
Even though I've been here for a while

You look so much better when you smile, so smile

Hopped up out the bed, I think my roof gone
Think I forgot to put my roof on
Said “fuck it, buy another car”
Hopped out the Lamb’
Said “fuck it"", bought another car
I bought the Phantom just to say it’s black
I bought the Phantom just to take a nap
I’m getting head in the backseat
I might stop and stand it tall like a athlete
I’m ballin’ hard, I need a jersey on
So much bread on me, I can buy a Jersey home
I’m on them Diddy’s, spendin’ Dirty Money

Still ballin’ like a muthafucker, tell ‘em that
Three platinum chains to match my platinum plaques
Ain’t got nuttin’ gold but some gold chains
Say “Jizzle, what’s the dough?”
Move the whole thang

He bought a 500, needy, need a halftime
If yo job ain’t ballin’ hard, then you need to quit
You need a 18 hard, then you need to split
Summer’s mine, winter too
I’m poppin’ bottles in the club, that’s what winners do
They claiming bitches, them my old hoes
They claim they ballin’ in my old flows

Niggas broke, acting like they got it though
I’m with a Spanish bitch, if she ain't fucking, adios!
So many cars I’m like eenie meenie minie moe
So many colors in the diamonds, Kaleidoscope
Last year I made a hundred million dollars flat
Run in ya house and get to poppin’ at your shower cap
My homies got them firebirds like Pontiac
And if them bitches don’t sell, we'll buy em back
Where the strippers, tell em Tune on his way
Tell them niggas I’m strapped like lingerie

Stressed out, running late, racing down the interstate
Spilled hot coffee, down the front of my jeans
It's work, work, pay the rent, money and my time's spent
Not a minute left for me to be me
Been going like nothing can wait
I got to get my priorities straight

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Friday night, here we go, do a little do-si-do
Kick back, have a laugh, catch my breath
Tell the band slow it down, there she is, think I found
Maybe Ms. Wonderful, I haven't met yet
It just hit me like a wrecking ball
She's giving me a wake up call

[Chorus]
I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little, love a lot

Step back, smell the rose
Feel the sand between your toes
Unplug, unwind
Step out in the sunshine

I need to live a little, have some fun
Take some time, waste it on number one
Find a girl that brings my whole world to a stop
Live a little

Take the girl, get a map and pick any old dot
Live a little, we need to live a little, love a lot"

Moment to let you know

There's just no perfect time
To confess how I feel
This much I know is real

Take these words
Don't let them go unheard
This is me reaching out
I hope you can hear me now

'Cause baby my heart's at stake
Take it, it's yours to break
I'd rather try and lose
Than keep this love from you

Waste one more second

Need anything else but your love

You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire

Your smile's so bright it's like a grill's in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there, nah
You're killin' me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feelin' real skills impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here

Use your voice every single time you open up your mouth

Every time that you lose it, sing it for the world

200,2012,Gotye Featuring Kimbra,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Verse 1: Gotye]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love, and it's an ache I still remember

[Verse 2: Gotye]
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus: Gotye]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
[Verse 3: Kimbra]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

[Chorus: Gotye & Kimbra]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing (Ahhh)
And I don't even need your love (Oooh)
But you treat me like a stranger, and that feels so rough (Ahhh)
No, you didn't have to stoop so low (Oooh)
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number (Ahhh)
I guess that I don't need that though (Oooh)
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

[Pre-Chorus]
Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
It's hard to look right at you, baby
But here's my number, so call me maybe
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy
But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

You took your time with the call
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all
But still you're in my way
I beg and borrow and steal
At first sight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it
But it's in my way

Your stare was holding
Ripped jeans, skin was showing
Hot night, wind was blowing
Where you think you're going, baby?

It's hard to look right at you, baby

But here's my number, so call me maybe
And all the other boys try to chase me
But here's my number, so call me maybe

Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad
I missed you so bad
I missed you so, so bad
Before you came into my life, I missed you so bad

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

I would still be holding you like this
All those fairytales are full of shit
One more fucking love song, I'll be sick, oh

You turned your back on tomorrow
'Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But you just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burned down

I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time

Sets in paradise

One more fucking love song, I'll be sick (Uh)
Now, I'm at a payphone
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, fuck that shit
I'll be out spending all this money while you're sitting 'round
Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for
Phantom pulled up, valet open doors
Wished I'd go away, got what you was looking for
Now it's me who they want
So you can go take that little piece of shit with you

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
I'm at a payphone, trying to call home
All of my change I spent on you (Whoo!)
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two? (For two?)

The holes in my apologies

Away from us, so stay
Stay with me, I can make
Make you glad you came

I see you standin' there on that lawn
Discount shades, store bought tan
Flip flops and cut-off jeans
Somewhere between that setting sun
I'm on Fire and Born to Run
You looked at me and I was done
And we're, we're just getting started

[Verse 2]
I was singin' to you, you were singin' to me
I was so alive, never been more free
Fired up my daddy's lighter and we sang
Oohh
Stayed there 'til they forced us out
And took the long way to your house
I can still hear the sound of you sayin' ""don't go""

I think about my old Jeep
I think about the stars in the sky

Like the soundtrack to a July Saturday night

I bumped into you by happenstance
You probably wouldn't even know who I am
But if I whispered your name I bet there'd still be a spark
Back when I was gasoline
And this old tattoo had brand new ink
And we didn't care what your mom would think
About your name on my arm

Baby, is it spring or is it summer?
The guitar sound or the beat of that drummer
You hear sometimes late at night
On your radio
Even though you're a million miles away
When you hear Born in the USA
You relive those glory days
So long ago

They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, ah
Pushing me away so I give her space, ah
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
[Chorus: Rihanna & Drake]
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost
(Yeah)

[Verse 2: Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're following your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate being alone, well you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you some
To save you, instead, they say

[Interlude: Gil Scott-Heron]
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
Don't tell me, I don't care
If you hurt, I don't tell you
You don't care, if you're true
[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you (I'll take, I'll take)
I've loved and I've lost"

Roll down the windows, turn it on up
Pour a little crown in a dixie cup
Get the party started

Girl, you make my speakers go boom boom
Dancin' on the tailgate in a full moon
That kinda thing makes a man go mmm hmmm

Hey, I'm a little drunk on you
And high on summertime

Good God almighty

Grip the grain, roll up
And your girlfriend want a nigga like me
Cause I ain't tryin' to control her
She call me when she wants a change
Black diamond, my pinky ring
And she know you weak and we ain't the same
You hit the scene, I make the scene
I'm in her head like Maybelline
H-Town so I'm made for lean
I'm in her soul, I make her scream
I don't ride the toll, don't pay the change
I'm EZ tag like Peter Pan
She want a man, don't need a man
I'm flying down your boulevard
She cookin' dinner with your pans
Draped up, dripped out
Your bitch know what I'm taking 'bout
Pulls up, pull out
We get it poppin' in the parking lot
She like to do it with the lights on
Don't matter to me if it's dark or not

Fossil pants, I'm hard as rock

There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field
A ""No trespass"" sign, and time to kill
Nobody's gonna get hurt, so what's the big deal?
There's somethin' 'bout a truck in a farmer's field

And there's somethin' 'bout beer sitting on ice
After a long hard day, makes it taste just right
On that dropped tailgate on a summer night
There's somethin' 'bout beer sittin' on ice

[Verse 3]
And there's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress
With an ice cold beer pressed against her lips
In that farmer's field (Hah), will make a boy a mess
There's somethin' 'bout a girl in a red sundress

[Verse 4]
And there's somethin' bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more
On that dropped tailgate, back behind the corn
The most natural thing you've ever felt before
There's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more

[Chorus]
And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees
And Lord have mercy, it's a beautiful thing
Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM
After a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in
You don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb
There's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2 AM

And there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field
And a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips
Begging for another kiss
And there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees

Ain't nothing 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck

To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting

I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences, they do a lot to teach us how to use the tools and gifts
We got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I got, and what I'm not
And who I am

I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love

Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?

[Verse 3]
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 4]
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
[Verse 5]
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Those flyover states

[Verse 6]
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
(Yeah)

[Outro]
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
Take a ride"
237,2012,Adele,Set Fire To The Rain,"[Produced by Fraser T Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Outro]
Oh
Oh, no
Let it burn
Oh
Let it burn
Let it burn"

249,2012,Zac Brown Band,No Hurry,"[Verse 1]
You know my old car needs washing
And the front yard needs a trim
And the telephone keeps ringing
And the bossman knows I know its him
And the bills aren't going to pay themselves
Don't matter anyway
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
There's nothing wrong with an old cane fishing pole
And the smell of early spring
Sit down in a fold-up easy chair
On a quiet shady river bank
Let the world go on without me
Wouldn't have it any other way
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today

[Bridge]
When I must return
To the cold cold ground
Have them take their time
When they lay this sinner down
[Verse 2]
Heaven knows that I ain't perfect
I've raised a little cain
And I plan to raise a whole lot more
Before I hear those angels sing
(Going to get right with the lord)
But there'll be hell to pay
But I'm in no hurry

[Chorus]
Ain't in no hurry
I'd be a fool now to worry
About all those things I can't change
And the time that I borrow
Can wait until tomorrow
Cause I ain't in no hurry today
Ain't in no hurry
Ain't in no hurry today"
250,2012,B.o.B,So Good,"[Verse 1]
Drinking a German beer, with a Cuban cigar
In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad
Great head on her shoulders, she probably studied abroad
She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March
She says that I'm her favorite 'cause she admires the art
Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars
She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin
Renaissance style, tonight is picture perfect, so smile
And pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

[Chorus]
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
[Verse 2]
Suffering from first class cabin fever
Five hour layovers from Norway to Egypt
I'm to the point like the pyramids of Giza
Still I'm to the left like the tower out in Pisa
I'm feeling single baby, I could use a feature
Swagger like Caesar, I'll get you a visa
We can go to Italy and maybe see the Colosseum
I'll be Da Vinci if you'll be my Mona Lisa, now smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita
We ain't gotta rush just take it slow
You'll be in the high life, soaking up the sunlight
Anything you want is yours
I'll have you living life like you should
You say you never had it so good

La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
La, la la, la la, la la, la, la la
You never had it so good
[Verse 3]
Well I been feeling singular, how 'bout let's make it plural
Spin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go
We'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros
And maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals
This is your month baby, sign of the Virgo
Private reservations, glasses full of Merlot
A Rosé, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo
Brush up on your Español, we're Barcelona-bound, so smile
So pack your bags real good, baby
'Cause you'll be gone for a while, while, while

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, tell me how you feel, what's your fantasy oh
I see us on a beach down in Mexico
You can put your feet up, be my señorita

251,2012,Tim McGraw,Better Than I Used To Be,"[Verse 1]
I know how to hold a grudge
I can send a bridge up in smoke
And I can't count the people I've let down, the hearts I've broke
You ain't gotta dig too deep
If you wanna find some dirt on me
I'm learning who you've been
Ain't who you've got to be
It's gonna be an uphill climb
Aw honey I won't lie

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Verse 2]
I’ve pinned a lot of demons to the ground
I’ve got a few old habits left
But there’s still one or two I might need you to help me get
Standing in the rain so long has left me with a little rust
But put some faith in me
And someday you’ll see
There’s a diamond under all this dust
[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see
I ain’t as good as I’m gonna get
But I’m better than I used to be

[Chorus]
I ain't no angel
I still got a few more dances with the devil
I’m cleaning up my act little by little
I’m getting there
I can finally stand the man in the mirror I see

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I got my mind on my money, all I need's a bad bitch
That I can run through the city spend this cash with
That I can run through this city spend this cash on
Wake up in the morning, get my smash on
I don't want much baby, egg whites
Keep your stomach and your thighs and your legs right
While I’m out here focused, getting this bread right
But if the head right, Jeezy there every night
Wake up in the morning and I'm still here
Wake up in the morning and I ain’t gone
All I ask, let me just do me
And maybe just me and you can get along
Had them other bitches mad when they seen us
Had them matching rolexes baby, team us
Yeah the earth is our turf, we can share the world
Maybe even go half on a baby girl

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Let me be your mind reader, let me read your mind
And when I’m done with the front, hit it from behind
Love and loyalty, never cross the line
Just hit a nigga up when I cross your mind
Show you how to get you on, you won’t be watching mine
Put you up on a G, show you how to shine
And maybe we can kick it when I got the time
Be my backbone, every nigga need a spine
Gotta know you ride with me if I’m right or wrong
Case I wake up in the morning and it’s all gone
Best believe I’ma get it right back
That's the hustler in me, I know you like that
You probably think I’m with a different broad every night
When I think about it, shit man, you’re probably right
The more I think about it, shit, you’re probably wrong
Cause what you didn’t think about is that I'm probably grown

She said she wish she never met me
Cause she just can't help her let me go ahead
And do whatever the hell I want
(Do what the hell I want, nigga)
She said she hate how much she need me
Turn around and say she don’t need me
Always talking about she gonna leave me but she don’t
(She never do though, haha)
But maybe this time might be different
Cause she shed so many tears
She’ll remind me all the dumb shit
That I’ve done over the years
But she don’t be tripping in the mornings
I got her legs up by her ears
But as soon as we get done
I swear this is all I hear

To hear somebody say it stops hurting
Or to hear somebody say she ain't worth it

You'll never understand
You don't know we've been through

No, you don't know how much I've got to lose
You don't know her like I do

I can't forget, I'm drowning in these memories
It fills my soul with all the little things
And I can't cope, it's like a death inside the family
It's like she stole my way to breathe
So don't try to tell me I'll stop hurting
Don't try to tell me she ain't worth it

I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & Chris Brown]
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, I'm not livin', oh, yeah)
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (no, no, no, no)
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (oh, yeah, I'm not livin', I'm not livin, ooh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (ooh, baby)

259,2012,Taylor Swift,Eyes Open,"[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Yeah
Just waking up in the morning and to be well
Quite honest with ya, I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on, Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in your corner like Mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

[Chorus: Ryan Tedder]
Give 'em hell, turn their heads
Gonna live life til we're dead
Give me scars, give me pain

Here comes a fighter
That's what they'll say to me, say to me
Say to me, this one's a fighter
[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
And if I can last thirty rounds
There's no reason you should ever have your head down
Six foot five, two hundred and twenty pounds
Hailing from rock bottom, Loserville, nothing town
Textbook version of the kid going nowhere fast
And now I'm yelling kiss my ass
It's gonna take a couple right hooks a few left jabs
For you to recognize that you really ain't got it bad

[Pre-Chorus: Travie McCoy]
Until the referee rings the bell
Until both your eyes start to swell
Until the crowd goes home
What we gonna do y'all?

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh, Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-whoa) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know anymore

[Refrain]
Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh
Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh
Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is it, boys, this is war
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
What are we waiting for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Why don't we break the rules already?
I was never one to believe the hype
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Save that for the black and white
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Try twice as hard and I'm half as liked
But here they come again to jack my style
[Bridge]
And that's alright (That's Alright)
I found a martyr in my bed tonight
She stops my bones from wondering
Just who I, who, I, who I am
Oh, who am I? Mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win (I always win)
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh Lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for, oh
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh) What do I stand for?
Most nights, I don't know

[Bridge]
(Oh, come on) So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this?
I miss my mom and dad for this?
(Oh, come on) No, when I see stars, when I s-
When I see stars, that's all they are
When I hear songs, they sound like a swan
So come on, oh come on, oh come on
Oh come on
[Verse 2]
Well, that is it, guys, that is all
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Five minutes in, and I'm bored again
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands
This one is not for the folks at home
(Oh-whoa, oh-ooh-whoa-oh)
Sorry to leave, Mom, I had to go
(Oh-ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh)
Who the fuck wants to die alone
All dried up in the desert sun?

[Bridge]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called ""love""
And then I look into my nephew's eyes
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible nights

The other night, you wouldn't believe
The dream I just had about you and me
I called you up, but we both agreed
It's for the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh
For the best you didn't listen
It's for the best we get our distance, oh"

I turn the TV off, to turn it on again
Staring at the blades of the fan as it spins around
Counting every crack, the clock is wide awake
Talking to myself, anything to make a sound

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

{Verse 2}
You can say we’re done the way you always do
It’s easier to lie to me than to yourself
Forget about your friends, you know they’re gonna say
We’re bad for each other, but we ain’t good for anyone else

{Chorus}
I told you I wouldn’t call, I told you I wouldn’t care
But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder
Come over, come over, come over, come over, come over

We don’t have to miss each other, come over
We don’t have to fix each other, come over
We don’t have to say forever, come over
You don’t have to stay forever, come over

But baby climbing the walls gets me nowhere
I don’t think that I can take this bed getting any colder

At the end of it all, you're still my best friend
But there's something inside that I need to release

Which way is right?
Which way is wrong?
How do I say that I need to move on?
You know we're heading separate ways

Yet there's oh so much that you deserve
Nothing to say, nothing to do

267,2012,Toby Keith,Beers Ago,"[Verse 1]
I had a hand-me-down ride painted rattle-can red
Second hand tires with poor boy tread
Made a lot of almost love in the bed of that
Truck that got stuck a lot
Just letter jacket boys singing Jerry Jeff songs
Drinking everything we could get our hands on
Learning ‘bout right by doin’ it wrong
Hopin’ we didn’t get caught

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fourteen hundred and fifty two beers ago
Oh

[Verse 2]
Skipped that town on my birthday
For eighteen years I was headed that way
Where old red stopped I just stayed
In a room without a view
I met a one look girl in a two bit bar
I had a place and she had a car
I won her heart with my guitar
I sang her the homesick blues ‘bout
[Chorus]
Spendin'what little bit of money we had
On Wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was fifteen hundred and sixty two beers ago
Oh

[Chorus]
And we spent what little bit of money we had
On wintergreen Skoal and main street gas
Go get your girl, go make the drag
If you’re lucky you can take her cross the railroad tracks
Where the man in the moon works his magic
On the second runner up of the 4H pageant
Seems like yesterday, even though
That was sixteen hundred and fifty two beers
Whole lot of highway, whole lot of years
Sixteen hundred and fifty three beers ago

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

[Verse 1]
We share something so common, but still so rare
And I’m in awe, never been here before
So high, we’re still climbing, even here inside these walls
Breaking each others hearts and we don’t care 'cause we’re so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smiling
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still surviving
'Cause I'm slowly breaking down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had

In too deep, can’t think about giving it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It’s killing me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fucking bad
The worst pain that I ever had"

EarDrummers, Mike WiLL Made-It
Yah! T.R.U., 2 Chainz!

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do, nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die, whattup?
[Verse 2: Drake]
2 Chainz and Champagne, you want true? That’s true enough
Forbes list like every year, my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us""
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say word
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
Real niggas say true
You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?
[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Name a nigga that want some, I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass, take him out
Bring 'em in, them whole things, 2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life, one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
I did what they say I wouldn’t, went where they say I couldn’t (Tru!)
YSL belt buckle, y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky, two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel, right hand on that pussy

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture, I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i

You ain't never told no lie, you ain't never told no lie

275,2012,Lupe Fiasco,Around My Way (Freedom Ain't Free),"[Produced by Simonsayz and B Sides; Additional production by Lupe Fiasco and Chill]

[Verse 1]
First off, say ""Peace"" to Pine Ridge
Shame at all the damage that the white man wine did
Ghost Dance, Trail of Tears, five million beers a year
And all that other crime did
More peace to the teachers of blind kids
To rebels in small cells keeping their mind big
Say everything's hostile
Suicide bombers and prosperity gospels, emaciated models
With cocaine and blood pouring out their nostrils, they got to
Just to stay awake on the catwalk of life where everybody watch you
Straight hair, high heels and a handbag
Crucifixes, racism and a land grab
Katrina, FEMA trailers, human body sandbags
A peace sign and a pants sag
A money toss cause a nine stripper mad dash
A friend request following a hash tag
Now everybody want it like the last laugh
A Michael Jackson jacket or a Daft mask
Purple Jordans or the mixed girl in your math class
Stable is when the Ba'ath had Baghdad
But corporate jets really had to have that gas bad
War and they hope they all fall from the ratatat
Cause that's just more dinosaur for their Cadillacs
[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 2]
And we marvel at the state of Ottoman
Then turn around and treat Ghana like a garbage can
America's a big motherfuckin' garbageman
If you ain't know, you're part and parcel of the problem
You say no you ain't, and I say yes you is
Soon as you find out what planned obsolescence is
You say no they didn't, and I say yes they did
The definition of unnecessary-ness
Manifested
Say that we should protest just to get arrested
That goes against all my hustling ethics
A bunch of jail niggas say it's highly ineffective
Depart from Martin, connect on Malcolm X tip
Insert Baldwin to similar the separate
To me, the truth is more fulfilling than a meth hit
Or finding really fast internet to have some sex with
It's all one song short of a set list
Couple croissants shy of a continental breakfast
Or blowing out your birthday candles just to make a death wish
So absurd, word to Chief Bone Necklace
Down at the Lakota Sioux Casino
A whole culture boiled down to giving you pokeno
I go as left as a heart in the chest
Cause the Horn of Africa is now starving to death
[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

[Verse 3]
An all-white Los Angeles, the dream of Mr. Chandler
Hope and pray they take Columbus Day up off the calendar
South Central an example of God's gifts
So shout to all the mothers raising babies in SPA 6
The projects of Oakland city, Detroit ghost towns
Monopolies on poverty where D-boy coke bound
It’s parts of Manila like the video for ""Thriller""
But the US Embassy is reminiscent of a villa
If poverty is chocolate and privilege vanilla
Then what’s the flavor of the Sunday preacher’s pedophilia?
Cash rules everything around these niggas
As classrooms everywhere around me wither
Hither you can be Mr. Burns or Mr. Smithers
The tyrant or the slave, but nowhere in the middle
Of the extremes of America’s dream
Freud fighting Neo, Freddy Krueger refereeing, now…
[Hook]
Live from the other side what you see
A bunch of nonsense on my TV
Heaven on Earth is what I need
But I feel I'm in Hell every time I breathe
Reporting live from the other side what you hear
A bunch of nonsense all in my ear
Rich man, poor man, we all gotta pay
Cause freedom ain't free, especially 'round my way

276,2012,Hunter Hayes,Wanted,"[Verse 1]
You know I'd fall apart without you
I don't know how you do what you do
'Cause everything that don't make sense about me
Makes sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl
I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You gotta know you're wanted too

'Cause I wanna wrap you up
Wanna kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
Yeah, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

Well, anyone can tell you you're pretty
And you get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty's deeper than the makeup
And I wanna show you what I see tonight
[Chorus]
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips
I wanna make you feel wanted
And I wanna call you mine
Wanna hold your hand forever
And never let you forget it
'Cause baby, I, I wanna make you feel wanted

As good as you make me feel (Make me feel)
I wanna make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales (Than your fairy tales)
Better than your best dreams (Your best dreams)

Wanna hold your hand forever

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
That’s foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all
[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us"

Hey!

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep; it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our
Bodies safe to shore

There's an old voice in my head that's holding me back
Well, tell her that I miss our little talks
Soon it will be over and buried with our past
We used to play outside when we were young, and full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear
'Cause though the truth may vary, this
Ship will carry our

Ay, oh, yeah
Cole world, ah, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, this is for all the fans that waited, the bitch niggas that hated
Old hoes we dated, look, Mama; we made it
Your son out in Barbados, cheese, eggs, and potatoes
Smokin' weed on the beach as my mind workin' like Plato's
Analyzin' the world, fantasizin' 'bout girls
I'm handin' diamonds and pearls, and vandalizin' her curls
Sweatin' her weave out, moans as she breathes out
Fuck I'm doin' in parties with Hova and Steve Stoute
I step over piranha, death over dishonor
They killin' niggas for J's, that's death over designer
Hey, Cole heatin' up like that left-over lasagna
Remember when I used to be stressed over D'wana
Now a nigga only text and get stressed over Rihannas
I'm talkin' tens and better, hood bitches in Timbs and sweaters
And we always argue 'bout the same thing
And tell me, why we gotta argue about the same thing, same thing, man?

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name
Yeah, baby, I love to call your name, name, name, eh
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh yeah, to my college girl: Take the weekend off and come home soon
I graduated way too long ago to be sneakin' all in your dorm room
But that thing tight like Fort Knox
So I call you when the tour stops
But baby, where your roommates?
Did you make sure the door's locked?
She love it when we get together
Smoke a little weed, put her shit together
Now that I'm on I can pick and choose
Only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
Yeah, I heard the stories 'bout different dudes
Her man on campus, but it's fine by me
She say she only fucked like four–five niggas
So you know you gotta multiply by three

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Nobody's perfect, uh
Nobody's perfect, ay ay, uh
Hey, but you're perfect for me
Nobody's perfect, uh (Ay, ay, ay)
Nobody's perfect, ay
Hey, but you're perfect for me
We rollin', we ridin'
He like to go inside and
I love to go all night and
We rock the boat: Poseidon
I love to call your name, name, name

284,2012,Jana Kramer,Why Ya Wanna,"[Verse 1]
Out of all of the places in this little town
Yeah, you had to come walking in here and sit down
I'm hiding and hoping my face ain't too red
Since we been over, been trying like crazy
To get you out of my head

[Chorus]
So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing
Moving in for a hug
Like you don't know I'm coming unglued
Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

[Verse 2]
I wish you had on sunglasses to cover up those blue eyes
I wish you said something mean to make me glad that you said goodbye
Why can't you look off somewhere if you catch me staring at you?
Why can't you be cold like any old good ex would do?

[Chorus]
So why you wanna
Show up in a old t-shirt that I love?
Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?
Don't know what you were thinkin', you were doing

Why you gotta, why you wanna
Make me keep wanting you

Why, why, why
Would you tell me that you call me up sometime?
Maybe we can get a drink and just catch up
Like that'd be enough
No, that ain't enough

Why you gotta tell me that I'm looking good?

285,2012,The Band Perry,Postcard From Paris,"[Verse 1]
I remember when my heart caught the fever
You were standing all alone in the summer heat
I was with my boyfriend, my new boyfriend
He was as sweet as he could be
But one look at you and I was through
My heart switched up on me

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
And now, I'm ruined
I'm ruined

[Verse 2]
In the evening you can catch me daydreaming
Did that moment send you reeling just like me?
I should've gone over, right over
I shoulda never let you leave
But it's the never-knowing that keeps this going
And drives me crazy

[Chorus]
Like a postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did is come around
[Bridge]
Just when I thought things were alright
My eyes play tricks on my mind, yeah
Will I ever be satisfied 'cause all I ever seem to find is a...

[Chorus]
A postcard from Paris when I've seen the real thing
It's like finding out your diamond is from her old promise ring
A call back from your fortune teller
She read your cards upside down
The meanest thing you ever did
The cruelest thing you ever did
The meanest thing you ever did is come around

I am ruined
Yeah, I'm ruined
Now I am ruined, yeah, I'm ruined"
286,2012,Andy Grammer,Fine By Me,"[Verse 1]
You're not the type, type a girl
To remain with a guy, with a guy too shy too afraid
To say he'll give his heart to you forever
I'm not the boy who will fall to his knees
With his hands clasped tight beggin' beggin' you please
To stay with him for worse or for better

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl for me

[Chorus]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

[Veres 2]
In the past I would try try hard to commit to a girl
Wouldn't get too far
It always somehow seemed to fall apart
But with you, you, you I can see what I need
I can dream realistically
I knew that this was different from the start
And it seems that every time we're eye to eye
I can find another piece of you, that I don't wanna lose
[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm staring at you now
There's no one else around
I'm thinking you're the girl I need

[Chorus]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me

[Bridge]
And it's never easy
But darling, believe me
I'm as skeptical as you
But when I think of life without us
It seems like what we're supposed to do
But I don't wanna come on too strong

[Chorus]
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
It's fine by me
If you never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me
I'm just saying it's fine by me
If we never leave
And we can lay like this forever
It's fine by me"
287,2012,Rascal Flatts,Banjo,"[Verse 1]
When I lose my smile
When my thoughts get jumbled
When the air and BS get too thick
Can’t take a breath
Without getting sick
I’ve had enough
With this concrete jungle

[Verse  2]
I drop my truck in drive
I pick up my baby
She jumps in with a kiss and a ""hey""
We exit off that old highway
Sometimes you gotta go
Beyond the pavement

[Chorus]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo
[Verse 3]
It ain’t on no map
And I’m glad it isn’t
Leave the phone and the GPS
Those satellites ain’t found it yet
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden

[Chorus x3]
You gotta go deep
Way on back
Cross a few creeks
And a couple little shacks
You gotta get lost
Way on out
Crickets and frogs
Yeah you’re gettin’ close now
And you kick it into four wheel drive
When you run out of road
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go
‘Til you hear a banjo"

Gucci made in Italy, Bally belt, I'm killing shit
The way I'm rocking Jimmy Choo, the word got out I'm dealing it
I fuck her, she a immigrant, don't touch her, she ain't got benefits
Bussing down them Benjamins, fuck it up on Louis kicks
That's the way I'm kicking it, Ferragamo cover me
Puerto Rican, Japanese, we laid up at the DoubleTree
Yellow ice a bumblebee, pinky ring a quarter key
IPhone a Metro, twerking off the whole thing
My earring a jelly bean, gangster lean and Irene
Red eyes, no Visine, I'm loc'd out on the drink
Horse shoes on my jeans, Robin jeans with the wings
Yellow bone on my team, trafficking them Yao Mings
Space boots with the spikes, go to AZ on the flight
Mail a hundred overnight, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm in Phipps with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds 'round my neck, no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite tryna bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that Actavis, it tasting like some bubblegum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
FreeBandz on Al Capone (Straight up)
And my cash way long (Turn up)
I see a bunch of clones

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time

At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

[Verse 3]
Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside Crim
Jumping 'cross me, you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louis, gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie!)
Future (Ask, yeah, yeah)

I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time

Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal

I know your plans don't include me
Still here we are, both of us lonely
Longing for shelter from all that we see
Why should we worry, no one will care girl
Look at the stars so far away
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?
We've got tonight babe
Why don' you stay?
Deep in my soul
I've been so lonely
All of my hopes, fading away
I've longed for love, like everyone else does
I know I'll keep searching, even after today
So there it is girl, I've said it all now

And here we are babe, what do you say?
We've got tonight, who needs tomorrow?

Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
Now you've been talking in your sleep
Oh, oh
Things you never say to me
Oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everything
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happening)
[Pre-Chorus: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
You've been having real bad dreams
Oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me
Oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love, love

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit’s enough
Just a second - we’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
I’ve never stopped
You’re still written in the scars on my heart
You’re not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Bridge: Nate Ruess & P!nk]
Oh, tears ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust, but our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No, nothing is as bad as it seems
We'll come clean

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's still written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken, just bent

Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side

Would look at us all the time

304,2013,Florida Georgia Line Featuring Nelly,Cruise,"""The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake""

So says country superstar duo Florida Georgia Line in their smash single from the spring of 2014, “This Is How We Roll.”  This is not just an empty boast, either.  Listen to the second verse while imagining Drake as a white, Southern, bro-country artist:

""Up on them 37 Nittos, windows tinted hard to see though [...]
Them kisses are for me though, automatic like a free throw
This life I live it might not be for you, but it's for me though""

Not only is the rhetoric Drake worthy – extolling the virtues of a uniquely superior lifestyle - but the way he rhymes “though” using a slang pronunciation three times in close succession, why, it even sounds like Drake!

On another track, their “Cruise Remix” video featuring Nelly, Florida Georgia Line also supply imagery indicative of their genre-blending.  While some rap music has long been short-sightedly accused of focusing on cash, cars, drugs, and women, FGL show that this is redneck thematic territory as well; just observe the expensive rides and seductively southern dames:Likewise, through artful alliteration, the boys name-drop their party drink as well:

""She was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker""

And this is all before we get to Nelly’s impassioned verse, which he contributes, according to the video’s opening scene, to help them learn how to “turn up.”

Judging by “This Is How We Roll” as a follow-up, it is obvious FGL have learned the lesson well –- so well that they have been influenced even by the structure of Hip-Hop, bringing in one of their homies for a guest verse: Luke Bryan, himself known to get turnt by mixing a little Conway with some T-Pain every once in a while.
Some people, though, are instead turning this trend down. While peeping their video on YouTube reveals over 16 million views (as of 7/17/14), the comments section is filled with vitriolic rants.  One such comment puts it this way: “Hick-Hop. Manufactured, lame, corporate horse crap. This is a disgrace to country music. Johnny Cash is rolling over in his grave right now.”
Really?
The same Johnny Cash who was the OG Southern thug!  The same Johnny Cash who put so much conviction into singing lines like:

""I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my woman down""
""When I was arrested I was dressed in black""

""I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die""
We’re talking the “Man In Black” himself!

I think he’d welcome the chance, were he still alive, to pal around with some new school gangsters, and, presented with an opportunity for a remix, would probably choose to turn up instead of turn it down!"

When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down

That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"

This is fucking awesome

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Now
Walk into the club like, ""What up? I got a big cock""
Nah, I'm just pumped, I bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
The people like, ""Damn, that's a cold ass honkey""
Rollin' in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink 'cept my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standin' next to me
Probably should've washed this, smells like R. Kelly sheets
Piss...
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents! (Bag it)
Coppin' it, washin' it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passin' up on those moccasins someone else has been walkin' in
Bummy and grungy, fuck it man, I am stunting and flossin'
And saving my money and I'm hella happy; that’s a bargain, bitch
I'ma take your grandpa's style, I'ma take your grandpa's style
No, for real, ask your grandpa, can I have his hand-me-downs? (Thank you!)
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found diggin'
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my mellow
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make 'em cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like, ""Ah, he got the Velcros""

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm huntin', lookin' for a come up

What you know about rockin' a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowin' about wearin' a fur fox skin?
I'm diggin', I'm diggin', I'm searchin' right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donatin' that plaid button-
Up shirt 'cause right now, I'm up in her skirt
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the bins
I'm not, I'm not stuck on searchin' in that section (Mens)
Your grammy, your auntie, your mama, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies second hand and I'll rock that, motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on the motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like, ""Oh, that Gucci? That's hella tight""
I'm like, ""Yo, that's fifty dollars for a T-shirt""
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a T-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting-swindled-and-pimped shit
I call that getting tricked by business
That shirt's hella though
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Tryna get girls from a brand?
Man, you hella won't! Man, you hella won't!

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels
Yes, you, make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
[Verse 2]
Never break a sweat for the other guys
When you come around, I get paralyzed
And every time I try to be myself
It comes out wrong like a cry for help
It's just not fair
Pain's more trouble than love is worth
I gasp for air
It feels so good, but you know it hurts

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear perfume for you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack

[Bridge]
The feelings are lost in my lungs
They're burning, I'd rather be numb (I'd rather be numb)
You know there's no one else to blame (No one else to blame)
So scared, I'll take off in a run
I'm flying too close to the sun
And I'll burst into flames
[Chorus]
You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm putting my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack (Heart attack)
I think I'd have a heart attack (-Tack)
Oh, I think I'd have a heart attack
I think I'd have a heart attack"
314,2013,Darius Rucker,Wagon Wheel,"[Verse 1]
Heading down south to the land of the pines
I'm thumbing my way into North Caroline
Staring up the road and pray to God I see headlights
I made it down the coast in seventeen hours
Picking me a bouquet of dogwood flowers
And I'm a-hoping for Raleigh, I can see my baby tonight

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me

[Verse 2]
Running from the cold up in New England
I was born to be a fiddler in an old time string band
My baby plays a guitar, I pick a banjo now
Oh, north country winters keep a-getting me down
Lost my money playing poker so I had to leave town
But I ain't turning back to living that old life no more

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey mama rock me
[Verse 3]
Walking to the south out of Roanoke
I caught a trucker out of Philly had a nice long toke
But he's a heading west from the Cumberland gap
To Johnson City, Tennessee
And I got to get a move on before the sun
I hear my baby calling my name and I know that she's the only one
And if I die in Raleigh at least I will die free

[Chorus]
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey mama rock me
Oh rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
So rock me mama like a wagon wheel
Rock me mama any way you feel
Hey hey mama rock me
Mama rock me
Mama rock me
Rock me mama like the wind and the rain
Rock me mama like a south bound train
Hey hey mama rock me
You can rock me

Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just

Well all the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died (Died)
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see

Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

Got me up all night
All I'm singin' is love songs
She got me up all night
Constant drinkin' and love songs
She got me up all night
Down-and-out with these love songs
She got me up all night
Drownin' out with these love songs
She got me up all night (Yeah)
All I'm singin' is love songs

She got me open all night (Uh-huh)
Got me open all night, hey

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Okay, back when I was sleeping in my mama crib
Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen-hundred for the rent, money well-spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—
[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya

[Chorus 2: J. Cole]
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are
All I'm singin' is love songs
And we are, we are, we are
Got me up all night
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)
And we are, we are, we are (She got me)

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Well, this has got to be the longest crush ever
If I ever get to fuck it'd be the longest bust ever
Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like East Bay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—
[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want you to want me
Would you believe me if I said I'm in love?
Baby, I want ya, yeah

Got me up all night

Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna change the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know that there’s no need for me to panic
'Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling

Smilin' in the photo booth
But we got closer (Yeah)
'Til you were eating off my spoon
You're coming over
And we would talk all afternoon

Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We’re going all the way""

Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sure
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

338,2013,Kendrick Lamar,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe","[Produced by Sounwave]
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life, I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me it's painless
You don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin' with you?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of his?
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tryin' to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
You're tryin' to keep it deprived
And only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past you
We live in a world, we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world, you livin' behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to
This shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable, give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
I'll let the people know this is somethin' you can blame
On yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
I'ma break out and then hide every lock
[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me, then put me on stages
To me, that's amazin'
To you that's a quick check
With all disrespect, let me say this
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me
Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got my drink, I got my music
I would share it, but today I'm yelling

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
You ain't heard the coast like this in a long time
Don't you see that long line?
And they waiting on Kendrick like the first and the fifteenth
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend and put that pussy on the pedestal
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream it's alive
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
I say bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe

Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why

From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady

Even when you fall apart
But this ain’t my mama’s broken heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a Kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holding the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there’s nobody else to blame

Can’t get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge's just a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make up, girl, it’s just a break up
Run and hide your crazy and start actin’ like a lady

And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah

Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)

Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran

Been down since day one, look at where we came from

Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

If your dream house
Is a double-wide trailer sitting back in the holler
On a country road
Then baby, that's where we'll go
If you don't wanna settle down
We can bounce around from town to town
And that's fine with me
If you wanna just ride the breeze

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map
I travel light and my bags are packed
Just as long as I'm where you're at
I'm gonna have a real good view
I'll go anywhere, anywhere with you

[Verse 2]
I'll bet there's a two lane
Running right through the middle
Of a wide open desert to a ghost town
If you wanna just hide out
We could send a postcard back
From a mountain top out in Idaho
Maybe get snowed in
Anytime baby you say when
[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere
West Virginia, baby I don't care
Mexico on a wild hair
Have you ever seen California
Pick a spot on any old map

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-ho

Well, the trouble with up is there's always a down
First I'm holding your hand and we're on the boardwalk
There's heaven right here on these streets and these docks

But the sun keeps settin', the days go fast
And the sand on the beach is like an hourglass
I can just feel it all slipping away
And babe I can already say that

As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true
The taste of your kiss is so bittersweet
I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Before you know it, it's all gonna stop
They'll be rolling up windows and puttin' up tops
Be a cold wind blowin' the leaves through the air
And you won't find a tan line anywhere

Baby, I know that it ain't over yet
So let's make the most of what we have left
But it's hard living for this moment we're in and
Knowing it's all gonna end

As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you

I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you

Yeah, looking at you, girl, standing there
Got your Wayfarers on and the sun in your hair
And just like the song in a seashell, you'll be stuck in my mind
Bouncing around in my head
And baby, I can tell

As long I live (as long as I live), whatever I do (whatever I do)
As great as it is, you know what's a bummer
I ain't ever gonna beat this summer with you
Baby, it's true

I ain't gonna beat
No way I'm gonna beat this summer with you"

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

She got a nigga at home, and one on the side
Best friend is a dyke, they fucked around a few times
Her and her momma alike, so all they do is fight
I tell her make me some money, she tell me, ""Make me a wife""
I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles
She tell me that's it's mine, I tell her stop lyin'
Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

And loves me like Jesus does

I'm a good old boy, drinking whiskey and rye on the levee
But she carries me when my sins make me heavy
And loves me like Jesus does

All the crazy in my dreams
Both my broken wings
Every single piece of everything I am

Cause she loves me like Jesus does

Wash her hands of me, leave me staring down some runway
But I thank God each night, and twice on Sunday

Store front mannequins sleeping in the lights
We used to smoke while we were jay-walking
Like it was your birthday every other Saturday night
Knew the bands so we never payed our cover

We never dressed to impress all the others
They would let us in on our laid back kinda style
But boy, you know it's been a while

Like you got anywhere better to be
You talk it up and give me the go 'round, 'round

Did you forget about how we went around?
I don't know why you don't take me downtown anymore

371,2013,Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Featuring Mary Lambert,Same Love,"[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Outro: Mary Lambert]
Love is patient
Love is kind
Love is patient

Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)
Love is patient (not crying on Sundays)
Love is kind (not crying on Sundays)

372,2013,Imagine Dragons,Demons,"[Verse 1]
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Verse 2]
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

[Bridge]
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this
But it'd sure be cool if you did
[Bridge: Blake Shelton]
Have a night that you'll never forget
And now you're standing in the neon

376,2013,Kenny Chesney,Pirate Flag,"[Verse 1]
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance
[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Bridge]
Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars

[Outro]
I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

Maybe I should take that picture off the dashboard
Before her memory hits the brakes and takes the wheel
Yeah, I bet she's still crying on that front porch
Yeah, this time it's gonna take some time to heal

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream
Thinking maybe it ain't mine
'Cause that girl's in every song I sing
She's in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Won't keep me warm tonight
God what am I supposed to do
There's more than miles in my rear view

Well, I'm headed north to what I swore I wanted
And trying not to buy into my doubts
But I just can't seem to keep myself from wondering
Why I'm jealous of all them headlights headed south

'Cause I'm on my way to Tennessee
Singing ""Georgia On My Mind""
Chasing what they say's a dream

Yeah, more than miles
Yeah, I've been changing lanes without my mirrors
Cause every time I look behind me I see her
I think I just realized how much I need her

[Chorus]
So I’m turning back for Georgia
Stopping short of Tennessee
I can’t put my dreams before her
Man, I need her with me
Cause that girl’s in every song I sing
She’s in every song I write
And that six string ridin' in her seat
Can sleep in the back tonight
Now I know what I’m supposed to do, yeah
There’s still more than miles in my rear view

You quarterback all these plays
Sometimes you're my enemy and I'm throwin' grenades

But here we go back down that road
That's just the way that it goes

No sir I ain't been drinking
I ain't even had one beer
This sweet thing's got me buzzin'
From whispering in my ear
Just take a peek up in here
At this little hot mess
Mister, you'll understand
I'm doing my best

[Chorus]
And I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
All over the road

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna get no ticket
Don't wanna cause no wreck
It's hard to concentrate with her pretty little lips on my neck
I say ""Girl take it easy""
She laughs, says ""It'll be fine""
How am I supposed to keep it between the lines?
[Chorus]
Yeah, I know I'm all over the road
I can't help but go
A little bit of left, a little bit of right
It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
When she's all over me, I'm all outta control
And all over the road

Something 'bout these wheels rolling
Radio playing gets her going
I'm trying to get her home as fast as I can go

It's hard to drive with her hand over here on my knee
Have a little mercy on me

So many knots in my pockets, them bitches need a massage
I was born in the drought, I hope I die in yo mouth
If you're a rat you should’ve died as a mouse
The weed louder than the opera house, til the fat lady sings
Drop codeine in my punch, I’m bout to take a swing
If niggas thinkin I’m soft, I’ll knock yo thinkin cap off
I get blood out these pussies, I’m a stinking tampon
This for my niggas back home, I’m so New Orleans regardless
Got bitches fallin like August could sell bullshit to a Taurus
My bitch is badder than me, call that Adam & Eve
I do tricks on my skateboard, not up my sleeve
I kiss yo bitch on the neck, shoot your man in the head
Get his mama address, then send his parents his head
I play with pussy, not these niggas
Crucify these niggas
Kidnap em, call they boss, and ask 'em who gone buy these niggas

A little party never killed nobody
So we gonna dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody

All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
Glad that you made it, look around
You don't see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands
And the rooms a bust
At the end of the night maybe you'll find love
Fake chit chat bout the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year I'm a master plan
If you make me realize I'm your man
If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight
Hotsy-totsy, paparazzi, hold it while I take this flick
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I'm breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I'm the bee's knees

It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I give you my heart
If you tear it apart, no, ah, ah, ah, oh
It don't mean a thing if I ain't in your eyes
Papa that ain't gonna fly, no, ah, ah, ah, oh

Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got
Just one nights all we got

What do you think Goonrock?
Are you ready?

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk

Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape

I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package

And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitchin'
Cut him off like karate

408,2014,Justin Timberlake,Not A Bad Thing,"[Verse 1]
Said all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start

[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me (Staring back at me)
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start
[Pre-Chorus]
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
(Don't you know) But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it

[Chorus]
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
(Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me)

[Bridge]
No, I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine

[Chorus]
Don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me"

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe

[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
[Verse 2]
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said ""It's nice to meet you""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
[Chorus]
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!

[Bridge]
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

[Final Chorus]
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)

Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son

Tan legs swingin' by a Georgia plate
I was lookin' for her boyfriend
Thinkin', ""no way she ain't got one""
Soon as I sat down I was fallin' in love
Tryin' to pour a little sugar in her Dixie cup
Talkin' over the speakers in the back of that truck
She jumped up and cut me off

[Chorus]
She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
I've been listenin' to the radio all night long
Sittin' 'round waitin' for it to come on and here it is""
She was like, ""come here, boy, I wanna dance!""
'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' me around till it faded out
And she gave me a kiss
And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

[Verse 2]
I'd gave that DJ my last dime
If he would have played it just one more time
But a little while later
We were sittin' in the drive in my truck
Before I walked her to the door
I was scannin' like a fool AM, FM, XM too
But I stopped real quick when I heard that groove
Man, you should have seen her light up

She was like, ""oh my God, this is my song
We've been listenin' to the radio all night long
I can't believe that it came back on, but here it is""

'Fore I said a word, she was takin' my hand
Spinnin' in the headlights she gave me a goodnight kiss
And I said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""

And she said, ""play it again, play it again, play it again""
The next Friday night we were sittin' out under the stars
You should have seen her smile when I broke out my guitar

We light it up
Light it up, light it up

The mixtape's got a little Hank, little Drake
A little something bumping, thump, thumping on the wheel ride
The mix in our drink's a little stronger than you think
So get a grip, take a sip of that feel right
The truck's jacked up, flat bills flipped back
Yeah you can find us where the party's at

Simmer down, simmer down

But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear

Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down

If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down

I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor

Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself

All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know ﻿I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young

Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over

And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide

Will come calling out at the mess you've made

445,2014,Miranda Lambert,Automatic,"[Verse 1]
Quarter in a payphone
Drying laundry on the line
Watching Sun Tea in the window
Pocket watch tellin time
Seems like only yesterday I'd get a blank cassette
Record the country countdown cause I couldn't buy it yet
If we drove all the way to Dallas just to buy an Easter dress
We'd take along a Rand McNally, stand in line to pay for gas
God knows that shifting gears ain't what it used to be
I learned to drive that 55 just like a queen, three on a tree

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Verse 2]
If you had something to say
You'd write it on a piece of paper
Then you'd put a stamp on it
And they'd get it three days later
Boys would call the girls
And girls would turn them down
Staying married was the only way to work your problems out
[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic

[Post-Chorus]
Automatic

[Bridge]
Let's pull the windows down
Windows with the cranks
Come on let's take a picture
The kind you gotta shake

[Chorus]
Hey, whatever happened to waitin' your turn
Doing it all by hand
Cause when everything is handed to you
It's only worth as much as the time put in
It all just seemed so good the way we had it
Back before everything became automatic"

Can't stand it but I still love you

[Verse 1]
Ayo, they could never make me hate you
Even though what you was doin' wasn't tasteful
Even though you out here lookin' so ungrateful
I'ma keep it movin', be classy and graceful
I told 'em it's no friends in the game, you ain't learn that yet
All the bridges you came over, don't burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain't earn that yet
Self-righteous and entitled but they swearin' on the Bible
That they love you when, really, they no different from all your rivals
But I still don't wish death on 'em, I just reflect on 'em

I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love, I still love

[Verse 2]
Yo, people'll love you and support you when it's beneficial
I'ma forgive, I won't forget, but I'ma dead the issue
Soon as you outta niggas lives is when they start to miss you
They see you doin' good, now it's kinda hard to diss you
Niggas be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
Niggas be mad when they can't come and live lavish wit' you
But I sped off in the Benzy
I see the envy when I'm causin' a frenzy
So I pop pills for 'em, cop cribs in the hills on 'em

I'm angry but I still love you

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain

She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I've been holding on too tight
With nothing in between

I take her home
I drive all night
To keep her warm
And time is frozen (The story of, the story of)

I spend her love
Until she's broke inside
The story of my life (The story of, the story of)

Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

[Hook]
But you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
[Verse 2]
Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
Well you see her when you fall asleep
But never to touch and never to keep
'Cause you loved her too much and you dived too deep

[Hook]
Well you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go

Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go
And you let her go...

Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh

Oh, oh, woah, oh, oh

Only know you love her when you let her go
'Cause you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home

Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make

Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out

Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work

Workin' on my shit

You can hate it or love it
Hustle and the struggle is the only thing I'm trusting
Thoroughbred in a mud brick before the budget
White chick on that Pac shit
My passion was ironic
And my dreams were uncommon
Guess I gone crazy, first deal changed me
Robbed blind, basically raped me
Rose through the bullshit like a matador
Just made me madder and adamant to go at 'em
And even the score
So, I went harder
Studied the Carters till a deal was offered
Slept cold on the floor recording
At four in the morning
And now I'm passin' the bar like a lawyer
Immigrant, art ignorant
Ya ill intent was insurance for my benefit
Hate to be inconsiderate
But the industry took my innocence
Too late, now I'm in this bitch!
You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Now get this work
Workin' on my shit

Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn first at the light that's in front me
'Cause every night I'ma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
'Cause it's all that I ever had

465,2014,Christina Grimmie & Adam Levine,Somebody That I Used To Know,"[Verse 1]
Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember
You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

[Chorus]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

[Verse 2]
Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
[Chorus]
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though

But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay? Would it be a sin?
If I can’t help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

[Verse 2]
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be

Take my hand, take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
For I can’t help falling in love with you"

476,2014,Eric Church,Give Me Back My Hometown,"[Verse 1]
Damn, I used to love this view
Sit here and drink a few
Main street and the high school lit up on Friday night
Down there it's another touchdown
Man, this year's team is stout
I can hear them going crazy
And up here so am I
Thinking about you sitting there saying I hate this, I hate it
If you couldn't stand living here why'd you take it, take it

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown

[Verse 2]
All the colors of my youth
The red, the green, the hope, the truth
Are beating me black and blue cause you're in every scene
My friends try to cheer me up, get together at the Pizza Hut
I didn't have the heart to tell them that was our place
These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street
Shed a light on everything that used to be

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, ooohh, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
You can have my grandma's locket
The knife out of my grandpa's pocket
Yeah my state champion jacket
I don't care you can have it
Every made memory
Every picture, every broken dream
Yeah everything, everything, everything

[Chorus]
Give me back my hometown
'Cause this is my hometown
Yeah, yeah, ooohh, yeah, yeah"

8 o’clock on Friday night I’m still at home
All my girls just keep on blowin' up my phone
Sayin', ""Come on, he ain’t worth the pain
Do what you gotta do to forget his name""
Now there’s only one thing left for me to do
Slip on my favorite dress and sky-high leather boots
Check the mirror one last time
And kiss the past goodbye

[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Verse 2]
Tonight I’ll let a stranger pull me on the floor
Spin me 'round and let him buy a couple more
But before it goes too far
I’ll let him down easy
'Cause tonight it’s all about dancin' with my girls to the DJ
Put that song on replay
[Chorus]
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off
Wanna get a little lost
In the noise, in the lights
Hey bartender, pour ‘em hot tonight
‘Til the party and the music and the truth collide
Bring it ‘til his memory fades away
Hey bartender

[Bridge]
I’m feelin' that buzz
I’m ready to rock
Ain’t no way I’m gonna tell you to stop
So pour that thing up to the top
I’m comin' in hot
Hey bartender
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh

Hey Bartender
What I’m really needin' now
Is a double shot of Crown
Chase that disco ball around
‘Til I don’t remember
Go until they cut me off

I took two weeks vacation for the honeymoon
A couple tickets all inclusive down in Cancun
I couldn't get my money back so I'm in seat 7A
I'm getting drunk on a plane
I bet the fella on the aisle thought I was crazy
Cause I taped your picture to the seatback right beside me
Now I've got empty mini bottles fillin' both our trays
I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737 rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 2]
We had this date marked on the calendar forever
We'd take that new wed limo airport ride together
I feel like a plastic groom alone there at the top of the cake
So hey, I'm getting drunk on a plane
[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

[Verse 3]
On my way home I'll bump this seat right up to first class
So I can drink that cheap champagne out of a real glass
And when we land I'll call her up and tell her kiss my ass
Cause hey, I'm drunk on a plane

[Chorus]
Buyin' drinks for everybody
But the pilot, it's a party
Got this 737
Rocking like a G6
Stewardess is somethin' sexy
Leanin' pourin' Coke and whiskey
Told her about my condition
Got a little mile-high flight attention
It's Mardi Gras up in the clouds
I'm up so high, I may never come down
I'll try anything to drown out the pain
They all know why I'm getting drunk on a plane

I'm getting drunk on a plane
I might be passed out
In the baggage claim
But right now
I'm drunk on a plane"

Here it go

[Verse 1]
Well, I won 2 dollars on a scratch-off ticket
So I went back to the counter and I bought 2 more with it
And I won 10 bucks and that was just right
So, I bought a six pack and a, a bag of ice

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You know even if our ship came in and this is all we got
It ain’t like we really need a million dollar yacht cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Verse 2]
Still, can you imagine if we ever struck it
I’d go shoot tequila, take a lime and suck it
And we’d tell our bosses they can do the same
We’ll find a big cruise ship and buy the whole dang thing
[Pre-Chorus 2]
We’d sail around the world and go to shore in a dingy
But till that dream comes true why don’t you grab your bikini cause

[Chorus 1]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
We’re laughing all the way to the river bank

[Bridge]
However it goes (whatever happens)
We’ve got it made (in these shades)
Cause baby we can float (behind this boat)
We can ride away

[Chorus 2]
We got an inner tube
We got a trailer hitch
We’re near the river and far from rich
But we have got each other and gas in the tank
And it's a beautiful day
We’re laughing all the way, to the river bank"

Summer coming through a rolled down window
Tearing down an almost two lane back road
Freedom and fireflies in the air

Living for today like there's no tomorrow
Follow the grooves, the tires in the grass
Staying on the gas like we're never coming back

It's a Friday night, it's a small town girl
Everything is right and we rule the world
2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa
Everything we wanna be
We are, we are, we are tonight

Toes in the grass with our hands up high
Dream as big as the midnight sky
So untamed and we're so alive tonight

2 twelve's in the truck back, beating
A bunch of rock stars on a riverbank singing, whoa, whoa, everything, whoa, whoa

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause

In that oak tree

A jagged little heart, so the whole town knew it
Carved in the bark with an arrow through it
I came out here to see it one more time

[Chorus]
And I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall
And I'm sittin' on a stump
Love is shady, love is tragic
It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
(Woo!)

[Verse 2]
Well, I guess all those years
They don't mean nothing
Now I can't wait
To count those rings
Nothing left of us but dust and splinters
A big pile of wood to keep me warm through the winter
Because I, I don't have you

But I got my chainsaw
Oh, you know its gotta go, it's such a shame y'all
But I ain't gonna be happy until those names fall

It's hard to bury the hatchet
Holdin' a chainsaw
Whoa, oh
Yeah
Just a little ol' chainsaw

I remember what you said that night
That you would love me for the rest of your life
We wrote ""Forever"" with a pocketknife

I don't have much to give, but I don't care for gold
What use is money, when you need someone to hold?
Don't have direction, I'm just rolling down this road
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

[Chorus]
Pack up and leave everything
Don't you see what I can bring?
Can't keep this beating heart at bay
Set my midnight sorrow free
I will give you all of me
Just leave your lover, leave him for me
Leave your lover, leave him for me

[Verse 2]
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old
Oh, I'm in love with you and you will never know
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone
Spare you the rising storm and let the rivers flow

You'll never know the endless nights
The rhyming of the rain
Or how it feels to fall behind
And watch you call his name

Did they ever fight like us?

Saw the mistakes of up and down

Never together

They never tried like us

Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack

Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's

And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Pretty soon, I'll be getting on my first plane
I'll see the veins of my city like they do in space
But my head's fillin' up fast with the wicked games, up in flames
How can I fuck with the fun again when I'm known?
And my boys trip me up with their heads again, lovin' them
Everything's cool when we're all in line for the throne
But I know it's not forever (Yeah)
[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)

[Bridge]
It looked all right in the pictures (Yeah)
Getting caught's half of the trip though, isn't it? (Yeah)
I'll fall apart, with all my heart (Yeah)
And you can watch from your window (Yeah)
And you can watch from your window

[Chorus]
Baby, be the class clown
I'll be the beauty queen in tears
It's a new art form
Showing people how little we care (Yeah)
We're so happy
Even when we're smilin' out of fear
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
[Outro]
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
And talk it up like, ""Yeah"" (Yeah)
Let's go down to the tennis court

I left a note on my bedpost
Saying not to repeat yesterday’s mistakes
What I tend to do when it comes to you
I see only the good, selective memory

Oh, here we go
You're part of me now
You're part of me
So where you go I follow, follow, follow

If the pussy ain't good then I probably won't feed her
Lil homie, you can keep her cause I really don't need her

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time
Work while I'm up in my prime
No I'm not wasting no time
Ain't no time to waste when there's money to make
Especially on none of these snakes
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now just tell me just what are your reasons kill him

[Verse 1]
Nothing but fire deriving from Baya
I am not no liar I am rap Messiah the one you admire
The one that will make your favourite rapper consider just to retire
Hungry like Kanye when he wrote the wire rap
Through my lisp though y’all want me to quit
Cause to the money nix told me to hurry
I told him no worries I’m up in the studio cooking no curry
But shooting like Curry dirty just like curry
But shoot more than 30 shoot 81 just like I’m Kobe
Catch you talking shit move you to left like Ginobli
You claiming we homies but move like a phoney like Speaker Knockerz  Rather be on my lonely than being with homies that only call me when I’m popping only call me when I’m popping but when I’m not popping my name you be dropping funny went from being most hated to the one most concentrated on wait I ain’t really done going off might of inspired your favorite poet don’t act like you don’t know it might of inspired your favorite dancer might of inspired your favorite rapper
Rapper or should I say actor
Cause most of these rappers be claiming they trappers
But really be actors just posing as trappers
You really work a 9 to 5 while I'm a lyrical 9
Most of you africans don’t think you can just like Obama
Just because your mama don’t believe in you
See this is the season to drop any reason that in yourself lead you to not be believing all you need is you and God to make it happen though mama don’t believe in your passion see this is my reason to grind our momma’s no they don’t believe in us our daddies they don’t believe in us only us believe in us and in God we trust one day will make it no chances was given we chose to take it and one day we pray to God that we just make it!
[Chorus]
This is my reasons to grind haters talk pay them no mind
If they calling they getting declined
No I'm not wasting no time

See this is my , this is my
Now what are your , what are your?
Now just tell me just what are your reasons to grind?

[Verse 1: Britney Spears]
Hey, don't you know that it's always the same?
From Australia 'round to LA
You can betcha', wherever the girls go, boys follow
We be keeping them up on their toes
They can laugh, but they don't get the jokes
Set your watch, they're so predictable
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]
(The girls roll up) Windows roll down
(Eyes on us) Jaws on the ground
(Watch them go) It's just so funny
(Like bees to the honey!)
[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!

[Verse 2: Britney Spears]
Tell me, is it true that these men are from Mars?
Is that why they be acting bizarre?
Every time I walk out of my house it's like, ""Hey, baby!""
They don't see me rolling my eyes
They buzzing around me like flies
They got one thing on their minds
(Some things don't change...)

[Pre-Chorus: (Britney Spears) & Iggy Azalea]

All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!
[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Damn, still killing them softly
I would spend time with you but that'd cost me
They pray that Iggy-Iggy give 'em one more chance
But busy Iggy wouldn't even give 'em one more glance
See, it's a thin line between the beauty and the beast
Slim waist, thick cake, the whole world want a piece
Bad girl, good (Ooh) would make you lose your mind
All of the boys begging Britney, hit 'em one more time
Iggs
What's up, Britney?

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Iggy Azalea]
All around the world, pretty girls
Wipe the floor with all the boys
Pour the drinks, bring the noise
We're just so pretty!
All around the world, pretty girls
Jump the line, to the front
Do what we like, get what we want
We're just so pretty!"

I was a liar, I gave in to the fire
I know I should've fought it, at least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure, 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better, 'cause you don't want a liar

I need to be the one who takes you home

I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time
[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart

I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty, bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough, I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left
That's still doing this shit, man

Way up, I feel blessed

My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God I hope they post it
I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled
I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school
A Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed"

[Video directed by Brendan Canty and Conal Thomson]
[Verse 1]
My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
""We were born sick""
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
[Verse 2]
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then I am human
Only then I am clean

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh Amen, Amen, Amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life"

Girl, you melt me like ice in whiskey
With those blue flame looks that you give me
You can't hide what's inside
And it's killing me right now to see you wanna slip off with me again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

[Verse 2]
You act like you don't know what you're missin'
Every time you end up back with him
'Cause it's safe, and you're scared
Of everything you're feelin' when we're burnin' the midnight down again

[Chorus]
Why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)
[Bridge]
Every goodbye is bittersweet
So why should we fight what we both need?

[Chorus]
And why should we go 'round and 'round the truth, like we've been doin'?
Every time we lie, girl, we're losin'
So why should we spend Saturday night alone
When I can call you on the phone, pick you up
Make it up as we go along
Pull an all nighter, chasin' that desire
Sparks flyin' in her eyes like lighters (Like lighters)
Get a little higher (Get a little higher)
Sippin' on fire (Sippin' on fire)

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)

I'm still the highest sellin' female rapper, for the record
Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me
Yo, I'm in that big boy, bitches can't rent this
I floss everyday, but I ain't a dentist
Your whole style and approach, I invented
And I ain't takin' that back, cause I meant it

LOL to the bank, check in my account
Bank teller flirtin' after checkin' my account
Pretty ladies, are you here? Truffle butter on your pussy
Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless
Smallest, regardless, largest in charge
And born in New Orleans, get killed for Jordans
Skateboard, I'm gnarly, Drake, Tunechi, and Barbie

No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside

In between the coats in the closet
She held on to that heart shaped locket
Staring at a family flawless
But it ain't a pretty picture tonight
Mom and daddy just wouldn't stop it
Fighting at the drop of a faucet
Cuts through the walls catastrophic
She's caught in the crossfire (Crossfire)
Puts her hands over her ears
Starts talking through her tears
She's sayin', and she's prayin'

[Chorus]
I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
Yeah, no smoke, no bullets
No kick from the trigger when you pull it
No pain, no damage done
(I wish words were like little toy guns)
And just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue
(I wish words were like little toy guns)

[Verse 2]
Wish there was a white flag waving
Or that they were both just faking
And it was just a game they were playing like shoot 'em up cowboys
Leave the plastic pistols in the front yard
Throw away the score card and just turn off all the noise

I wish words were like little toy guns
No sting, no hurt, no one
Just a bang bang rollin' off your tongue

So baby let’s take it, take it
[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Bridge]
I ain’t gonna do it like a pretty city boy
I’m a fishin’ in the dark nitty gritty boy
So let me love you

[Chorus]
Slow as the Mississippi
Strong as a fifth of whiskey
Steady as a Tom Petty track
I wanna love, wanna love you like that
Deeper than a sunset sky
Sweeter than muscadine wine
All night ‘til the sun comes back
I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that

[Outro]
Yeah
Baby, I wanna love, wanna love, wanna love you like that"

Damn you really turn me on painting your toenails pink

I hope those bricks and boards can take it
But I won't be surprised if the whole damn place just falls

As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

[Verse 1]
First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin'
I want it bad, and I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?""
Damn…
[Chorus]
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 2]
I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin
Fuck…

And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

[Verse 3]
Yeah, you know that feelin' when you know
You finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go, right?
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palms sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top
And then she get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
[Chorus]
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no

Over there toting that gun
For Uncle Sam and our freedom
Mom and Daddy dressed in black
They folded up that flag
Handed it to dad
And started praying
Yeah he went out 21 guns blazing

[Chorus]
And that's One Hell of an Amen
That's the only way to go
Fighting the good fight
Till the good Lord calls you home
And so be well, my friend
Until I see you again
This is our last goodbye
But it's a Hell of an Amen

Doctor said he ain't got long
He just smiled said bring it on

We all hit our knees
Started praying
No, he never gave up
Said the Good Lord's waiting

Seinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, ""What, what's going on here,"" You know?
""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong
[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', ""let him go""
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you

Baby, I've been making plans for you

We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”"

[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Preset all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

[Chorus]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Verse 2]
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

[Chorus]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Lest you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Chorus]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind"

Raise 'em up
I'm talkin' 'bout a lighter on a Saturday night

Shotgun seat, there's the one you love and you're kissin' on

[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Get those white sails sailing down in Mexico
It's just a whiskey glass if you ain't makin' a toast
Lift your tear-filled eyes up to the sky
A comin' home, you've been gone too long
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

[Verse 2: Eric Church]
Raise 'em up
You got a voice, you got a choice
Go make some noise
Don't ever let 'em tell you who you are
Raise 'em up
Fist black and blue, fight for the truth
Its what you do
Hand on your heart for the stripes and stars
[Chorus: Eric Church & Keith Urban]
Black umbrellas in the pourin' rain
A Sunday Morning Coming Down, Amazing Grace
Lift those tear-filled eyes up to the sky
As the flag flies, say goodbye
Tonight were gonna
Raise 'em up

So, you meet someone
The only one
You take her by the hand
Make a stand
Buy some land
Make some love
And them babies come

Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up trophy high
Raise 'em up to the sky
Raise 'em up, show everybody that newborn smile
Raise 'em up tall and strong

And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

[Verse 1]
So I'm s'posed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm s'posed to believe that they're asking you if you're home?
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you, but I won't be a fool for you
That is just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean, I'mma stay if you could tell the truth
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Is that your bitch over there, giving me the ugly stare?

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me

You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

[Verse 2]
So you bought me a car, he can buy that too
I can take care of myself and I can find someone to do it too, baby
You actin' like you upgraded me, I upgraded you
You and me, Fashion Week at Paris, I put you on to that new
But you took advantage, oh you took advantage, oh you took advantage
I cannot understand, I cannot understand, I cannot understand it
I thought you'd always be there for me, yeah, yeah
But if you ask me if I knew betta now, hell yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
So you can keep that bitch over there, giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass, and the Brazilian hair

I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)
[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

So I guess it's over, baby
Déjà vu again
Who'd have thought that time don't stop?
And somehow girl, the world keeps spinning
And guess I've turned myself into a solitary man
Ain't like I'm the only one that's in the shoes that I am

[Chorus]
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

[Verse 2]
I know that it might sound jaded
And I have to say
I think love is overrated
But I don't like throwing it away
I know you could probably tell me right where I went wrong
Some guys can't have all the luck if others don't sing sad songs

Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
I'm right back (I'm right back)
At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)
It's where I'm at (It's where I'm at)
It's the sound of teardrops falling down, down
A slamming door and a lesson learned
I let another lover crash and burn

That's right
Another lover
Another lover, crash and burn
Ooh, yeah

At the sound of lonely calling
Do you hear that? (Do you hear that?)

Was it all just pretend back then when
You said you loved me for me?
Cause lately it seems the girl of your dreams
Is someone that I can't be

Well I used to believe you knew better than me
But now I'm the one in control

She's no stranger to the leaving
She's heard all the best goodbyes
Fallin' has a different meaning
To her, you're just another guy

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way
To break free from what's been broken
Too many cowboys rolled away
So, forgive her if she's distant
She can't tell her heart to lie, no
You'll never be her one and only
She don't love you, she's just lonely

[Verse 3]
You can hold her in the moonlight
You can give her all the stars
You can promise her forever
But you'll never have her heart

She don't love you, she's just lonely
She don't know another way, oh
To break free from what's been broken

595,2015,Brad Paisley,Crushin' It,"[Verse 1]
I sure could use an attaboy or a big old high five
I'd love to hear ""You're killing it, dude"", yeah, it's been a long time
Since I hit one out of the park, or nailed it as they say
I guess I've been in a dry spell but that's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, yeah, I'll be crushin' it

[Verse 2]
They say your baby's mad cause you told her that you'd hang some pictures for her
You know the ones she framed late last spring of you and her in Florida
You're up on the ladder when it shatters into smithereens
She shakes her head, looks at you and says
""Ain't you good for anything?"" and you say

[Chorus]
Every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
You want a margarita, I'll get Tequila and ice
And I'll be crushin' it, with a cold one in my other hand
I'll be crushin' it, when I'm finished with my can
I can stomp it with my boot, clench it with my fist
Smash it on my forehead, yeah I got this
I'll be crushin' it, oh, I'll be crushin' it
Oh
[Bridge]
I figured this out in college, walking past them Gothic columns
That I was gonna probably wind up somewhere near the bottom
I was never gonna be the best and brightest guy around
But like the great George freakin Strait, I'm the king of getting unwound

[Chorus]
And every week has a weekend, by this time Friday night
I'll be done with my third can of cold Bud Light
And I'll be crushin' it, every weekend's a weekend
Yeah, I'll be crushin' it, by this time Friday night
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be done with my third can
Oh, I'll be crushin' it, of cold Bud Light
I'll be crushin' it, I'll be crushin' it"
596,2015,twenty one pilots,Stressed Out,"[Verse 1]
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
[Bridge]
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
Sayin', ""Wake up, you need to make money!,"" yeah

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money

But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

605,2016,Lukas Graham,7 Years,"[Chorus]
Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was seven years old

[Verse 1]
It was a big, big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By eleven, smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich, so we were out to make that steady figure

[Chorus]
Once, I was eleven years old, my daddy told me
""Go get yourself a wife, or you'll be lonely""
Once, I was eleven years old

[Verse 2]
I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once, I was twenty years old (Lukas Graham!)
[Verse 3]
I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me, at least those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later
[Chorus]
Once, I was twenty years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything I saw before me
Once, I was twenty years old

[Bridge]
Soon, we'll be thirty years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon, we'll be thirty years old

[Verse 4]
I'm still learning about life, my woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs, and I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me, some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind, my brother, I'm still sorry

[Chorus]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, my daddy got sixty-one
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit once or twice a month
[Breakdown]
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old
Soon, I'll be sixty years old, will I think the world is cold?
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me?
Soon, I'll be sixty years old

Once, I was seven years old, my mama told me
""Go make yourself some friends, or you'll be lonely""
Once I was seven years old
Once I was seven years old"
606,2016,Mike Posner,I Took A Pill In Ibiza,"[Verse 1]
I took a pill in Ibiza to show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older
But fuck it, it was something to do
I'm living out in LA, I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes
[Chorus]
But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

[Verse 2]
I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot
And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up
[Chorus]
Now you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs (Hey)

[Bridge]
I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star
I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient
So I looked 'em in the eye and said
[Chorus]
You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster
And be all alone
You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Don't need permission

Know what I'm doing

You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

[Pre-Chorus]
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
[Pre-Chorus]
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days

To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

So, come on, let it go, just let it be

Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away

Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide

So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me

There was a time when I was alone
Nowhere to go and no place to call home
My only friend was the man in the Moon
And even sometimes he would go away too
Then one night, as I closed my eyes
I saw a shadow flying high
He came to me with the sweetest smile
Told me he wanted to talk for a while
He said, ""Peter Pan, that's what they call me
I promise that you'll never be lonely""
And ever since that day

[Chorus]
I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods
Always on the run from Captain Hook
""Run, run Lost Boy,"" they say to me
Away from all of reality
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free
Neverland is home to Lost Boys like me
And Lost Boys like me are free

[Verse 2]
He sprinkled me in pixie dust and told me to believe
Believe in him and believe in me
Together we will fly away in a cloud of green
To your beautiful destiny
As we soared above the town that never loved me
I realized I finally had a family
Soon enough we reached Neverland
Peacefully my feet hit the sand
And ever since that day...

I am a Lost Boy from Neverland
Usually hanging out with Peter Pan
And when we're bored we play in the woods

A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room

See many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man
But literally, I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" an' that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true

But then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 1]
Button start the foreign, oh my God I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 2]
There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 3]
Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she round me she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl I'm sorry
You just high yella you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’"
632,2016,Justin Bieber,Sorry,"[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
[Verse 2]
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Bridge]
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (Oh, no, no)
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body (Your body)
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

[Chorus]
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?"

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time
Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you...
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you
If you're okay
My friends always
Feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier
Than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know
How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got as high as your expectations
Last night, oh  came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it(2x)

Ohh...
I'm too good to you

Girl, you're getting over him and I'm getting over her
The eyes have it made, ain't gotta say a word
Misery loves company, that's why it's you and me
Buying each other drinks
Back at the bar, as thick as thieves
Stealing these little sips
Doing our best to make the best of the worst of it

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget

[Verse 2]
Go ahead and check your phone, like I've been checking mine
Nobody's ex is texting for a rewind
Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through
What we're get'in through

[Chorus]
Keep playing them songs, keep singing along
Keep leaning it on in closer
Keep salting the rim, getting even with her and with him before the night is over
That first kiss was like a Colorado hit
We better keep on keeping it lit
'Til we can't remember, can't remember
What we came here to forget (yeah)
Just what we came here to forget

Looks like it's just me and you
Falling in love just enough to get us through

Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
Run up them bands on the regular, hittin' my plug on the cellular
Tell my ex bitch that I'm sorry, I'ma skate off in the 'Rari
Keep 36 by my side, I'ma go bake me a pie
Keep 45 on my side, fuck with my niggas, you die
All of my niggas say blood, all of my niggas say cuh
OT, I found me a plug, I got it straight out the mud
Keep it a hundred, no bull, I fell in love with the drugs
Bustin' it down in the tub, pay me my money in dubs
Water whippin', lookin' like I'm fishin'
Baseball in kitchen, with my arm I'm pitchin'
Rolie on, it's glistenin', and my darling, kissin'
Niggas steady trippin' so I'm steady grippin'
Dirty money on me, got a scale up on me
I don't fuck with phony, 'bout to sell a pony
All these niggas on me, all these bitches on me
Say my price is good, motherfucker, show me

[Verse 2: Young Dolph]
Went and bought a 911 with my trap money
A million up, but still ain't never touch my rap money
I'm out in LA fuckin' with that boy O.T
Flew to LA, got a plug on that OG
You know I've been gettin' money if you know me
When I first met my plug, I told him, ""I piss a hundred G's""
I ain't comin' to get it unless you got a hundred piece
I don't want it, fuck it, your price, you need to cut it
Your ice, you need to tuck it, she fuck with me, she lucky
A half a million, all 20s in that Gucci luggage
Let's skip the small talk, it's time to talk numbers
Young nigga playin' with commas, might go get a Lamb for the summer
I've been outchea in these streets all my life hustlin'
My nigga beefin' then I'm beefin', wrong or right I'm bustin'
My traphouse, I love it
Put some Forgis on my old school and I had to gut it
But should I put a roof in?
[Chorus: O.T. Genasis]
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it
Them bricks is way too hot, you need to cut it
Your price is way too high, you need to cut it
Cut it, cut it, cut it, cut it

I'm the only one in the room that they fear right now (woo!)
I think they're clear right now
Let's celebrate, no red Champagne, we don't play that
All we see is gold bottles and paper plane hats
21 Grammys that I use for D'USSÉ cups
I'm on the penthouse floor, call your way up
The OG's say, ""HOV, how high is high enough?""
I said, ""Till we eye and eye with the higher-ups""
Until we let 'em know, we ain't those niggas
Until our babies showered in gold, nigga
Blue lookin' like Pac in the tub

We never gonna let the elevator take us down, aaaahhh!

Stars on the roof got her feelin' like Venus
Gettin' so much brain now I'm a Don CartaGenius
Ever since Pun been gone, been independent
So I went and threw the Pun Jumpman up in the pendant
Ha! I flooded out all the Christ's
Out in Paris, I learned what real ice is
Hee-shee, I'm kickin' flava' in your ear
I just had a gray on my face and it disappeared
I just dropped the biggest of checks, and the shit cleared
When everybody counted us out just this year
Uh, I'm Steph Curry in the clutch
Take a shot of this Royal Elite, and go all the way up!

When the bitch was gone, they was really playin' with it
I was sittin' listenin', like, ""They ain't even sayin' shit!""
Now the real is back, I see they all tryna change and shit
But it's really too late now, I'm goin' back (Go!)
One of these bitches, two of these bitches gotta die
Three of these bitches, four of these bitches gonna cry
Five of these bitches poppin' pills, they high
Six bird bitches, none of them get fly
See, I don't wanna hear about your records and big numbers

Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up

Know how bad you wanna tell 'em, ""don't try him""
I don't wanna tell 'em, let's surprise 'em
I don't wanna get into it – why you stressin' him? I've been drivin'
Back and forth, from Louisville to Lexington, mileage
On the whip, got your ass in my grip
College make you wanna strip for them dollars
Nah girl, I got a job for you, swear to God I can do a lot for you
Saw you strollin' through the campus, I had to stop for you
I was scrollin' through the 'gram, girl, I had to follow you

Visit grandpa every chance that you can
It won't be wasted time
Always stay humble and kind

Hold the door, say please, say thank you
Don't steal, don't cheat, and don't lie

Don't expect a free ride from no one
Don't hold a grudge or a chip and here's why

Real ting ay
Yeah

I pull up in Lexus' like it's '07
I just hit a lick, I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin'
Boss up, I'm the bigger homie
But I'm one year older than my lil homie
'09 they was biddin' on me
But I'm Young Money, got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said, it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses, he been blackin'
Chasin' women a distraction
They wan' be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Don't you see Riri right next to me?
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same, but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point in even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me 50 at Tiffany's
Shout out to Tiffany, Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me
[Chorus: Drake]
Done
Look what I've done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk

Me I'm just done, done, done, done, done

I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin' out the Phantom
6 cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin' 1's out the plastic
Her gram too poppin' to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it, I'm serious
I feed my family with this
So don't play with my money this summer, I'm serious
I don't run out of material
You shouldn't speak on me, period
You try to give 'em your side of the story
They heard it, but they wasn't hearin' it
They feeling a way and won't hide it
Niggas done being silent
Don't get along man, we tried it
What's the point of even tryin'?
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin' to mention me
They gotta go, they gotta go
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give 'em no empathy
I'ma have B's when I'm 70
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I don't know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I don't let it get to me

We had a patio with a view of a parking lot
It was two for one and four for two
Had Christmas lights in the middle of June
All hung up like I was on you

You say, ""No way"" then you move in closer

The way you wore my, my T-shirt
Yeah, you look good in my t-shirt, girl

With the neighbors saying ""Keep it down""
But it's hard to unlock the door
When you're making out (You know what I'm sayin'?)

So why you leanin' in for one more kiss
And pretty soon you're sliding off what you've got on
And slippin' into my

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains within the sound of silence

[Verse 2]
In restless dreams, I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night and touched the sound of silence

[Verse 3]
And in the naked light, I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never shared
And no one dared disturb the sound of silence

[Verse 4]
""Fools"", said I, ""You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you""
But my words like silent raindrops, fell
And echoed in the wells of silence
[Verse 5]
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon God they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, ""The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls""
And whispered in the sound of silence"

I gotta talk to God even though He isn't near me
Based on what I got, it's hard to think that He don't hear me
Hitting like that 30 on my jersey, man, I'm gifted
Whole lot of sixes, but I'm still like
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Six-point star, Lion of the Judah
All my niggas ain't off rockin' Gucci
One do it, then we all gotta do it
Got the key, now the door's open, and we all goin' through it
Whole city at your head for the boy
I ain't even gotta call no one for it

Feeling used, but I'm
Still missing you and I can't
See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 2: gnash]
I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Fucked around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart, too
And I'm always tired, but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that shit
I put this reel out, but you wouldn't bite that shit
I type a text, but then I never mind that shit
I got these feelings, but you never mind that shit
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me, but your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Verse 3: gnash]
I don't mean no harm, I just miss you on my arm
Wedding bells were just alarms
Caution tape around my heart
You ever wonder what we could have been?
You said you wouldn't and you fucking did
Lie to me, lie with me, get your fucking fix
Now all my drinks and all my feelings are all fucking mixed
Always missing people that I shouldn't be missing
Sometimes you gotta burn some bridges just to create some distance
I know that I control my thoughts and I should stop reminiscing
But I learned from my dad that it's good to have feelings
When love and trust are gone
I guess this is moving on
Everyone I do right does me wrong
So every lonely night, I sing this song
[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien  with gnash]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

[Bridge: Olivia O'Brien with gnash]
All alone, I watch you watch her
Like she's the only girl you've ever seen
You don't care, you never did
You don't give a damn about me
Yeah, all alone, I watch you watch her
She is the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you never notice
That you are slowly killing me?

[Chorus: Olivia O'Brien]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her"

Oh, I know you feel what I feel
Breaking you off, it's so real
I can't fake that, babe
My love's locked down and you cuffing it
You're the only one I trust with it
You're the only one that stuck with it

It's about us right now, girl, where you going? Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, linking me down on my line
Busy as usual but we should make some time
Looking for things you can find
Just so you can have something to bring up when it's time
Mixing vodka and emotions, tapping into your emotions
Dry cry cause I'm hopeless
Choosey lover for the moment
Different story when I leave you
Story up just to keep you
I need you 'round, I need you, oh
[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Jeremih]
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?
It's about us right now, girl, where you going?

It's all about us right now, girl, where you going?
I'm with you, I'm with you"

I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all

Changin' your opinion on me

But you don't have the time to wait on me

666,2016,Carrie Underwood,Church Bells,"[Verse 1]
Jenny grew up wild, like a blackfoot daisy
Out in the shack with a blue tick hound
Broke as hell, but blessed with beauty
The kind that a rich man can't turn down
She caught the eye of an oil man dancing
One summer night in a dime store dress
She had the looks, he had the mansion
And you can figure out the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all roses, drippin' in diamonds
Sippin' on champagne
She was all uptown, wearing that white gown
Takin' his last name

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 2]
Jenny was hosting Junior League parties
And havin' dinner at the country club
Everyone thought they were Ken and Barbie
But Ken was always gettin' way too drunk
Saturday night, after a few too many
He came home ready to fight
And all his money could never save Jenny
From the devil livin' in his eyes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
It was all bruises, covered in makeup
Dark sunglasses
And that next morning, sitting in the back pew
Praying with the baptist

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
And up in the loft, that whole choir singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
You just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'

[Verse 3]
Jenny slipped somethin' in his Tennessee whiskey
No law man was ever gonna find
And how he died is still a mystery
But he hit a woman for the very last time

[Chorus]
She could hear those church bells ringin', ringin'
Standin' there in a black dress singin', singin'
Fold your hands and close your eyes
Yeah, it's all gonna be alright
And just listen to the church bells ringin', ringin'
Yeah, they're ringin'"

You don't own me
You don't own me

Woah, let's go
But I'm Gerald and I can always have just what I want
She's that baddest I would love to flaunt
Take her shopping, you know Yves Saint Laurent
But nope, she ain't with it though
All because she got her own dough
Boss bossed if you don't know
She could never ever be a broke ho

[Verse 2: SAYGRACE]
You don't own me
I'm not just one of your many toys
You don't own me
Don't say I can't go with other boys

And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

Don't try to change me in any way
You don't own me
Don't tie me down cause I'd never stay

And don't tell me what to say
Please, when I go out with you
Don't put me on display

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Really though, honestly
I get bored of basic bitches
She's the baddest, straight up vicious, texting her and asking her
If she's alone and if she'd sent some pictures, she said no (what)
Well goddamn, she said come over and see it for yourself
Never asking for your help, independent woman
She ain't for the shelf
No, she's the one
Smoke with her till the weed is gone
Stayin' up until we see the sun
Baddest ever, I swear she do it better than I've ever seen it done
Never borrow, she ain't ever loan
That's when she told me she ain't never ever ever ever gonna be owned
[Verse 5: SAYGRACE]
I don't tell you what to say
I don't tell you what to do
So just let me be myself
That's all I ask of you
I'm young and I love to be young
I'm free and I love to be free
To live my life the way I want
To say and do whatever I please

The rain is coming down tonight
I'm smiling, looking at this photograph
I hear that song and I'm flying right back to when we had it made
Every Friday night when the sun went down
We'd be running them streets like we owned the town

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on a two lane road
Had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels so good

[Chorus 1]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, Spark, and Light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time

[Verse 2]
Out of nowhere, it slipped away
And the rope by the river hangs silently
And the town that I knew ain't nothing like it used to be
Ah, I can't explain
They took all the color from the picture frame
And the days got sold to the grit and the game
[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't let it go, no, I just can't let it go
I wonder if you ever think about it like I do
Seven kids on my two lane road
We had The Guns on the radio
After all this time it still feels, feels so good

[Chorus 2]
When I think about those summer nights
Singin' out the window, on the back roads, Sweet Child of Mine
Sippin' on the Loko's, spark a light
Ain't it funny how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
Swinging on the line
Living all that wasted time

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, now
Summer dresses dryin' out on the hood of the car
Only music that we had was out the left speaker
We were living every second 'til the time ran out
We had nothing but we had it all

[Chorus 3]
When I think about those summer nights
Sneaking out the window, running back roads
Your hand in mine
We were going nowhere, we were so alive
Uh huh, ain't it crazy how the best days of my life
Was all that wasted time,  all that wasted time
We were swinging out on the line
Living all that wasted time
[Outro]
Hey, you know oh
All that wasted time
Don't you feel it coming on back now
Time, time, time"

Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

Make me feel the same way that I did to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves

Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side

Keepin' this turntable spinnin'
Everything from Jones to Jennings
Slowly plannin' my survival
In a three-foot stack of vinyl
Since you had to walk on outta here

I'd just sit in silence by myself
Turn this house into a jail
Dyin' slow in a livin' hell

I usually make it through side A sober
All bets are off when I flip her over
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Are poundin' on this heart of mine

Or I'm gonna blow out my ears

Your leavin' left me goin' crazy
I'm countin' on a needle to save me
I drop it in the groove
And we go 'round and 'round
And down in a spiral

Got down with old James Brown
And found New Grass Revival
If you find your way back, I owe you a beer
For my record year

You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time

But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd

Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight

Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on

Talking 'bout rules, you know we're gonna break 'em

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far

I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it (Not make it), I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not

[Verse 2: Belly]
Bitches know, told a ho, ""It's different strokes for different folks""
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke (L-Liquor, smoke)
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough (Dick and dough)
Told her, ""You don't gotta make it difficult""
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion (Yeah)
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes is Christian (Yeah)
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired (Haha)
Why you the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong

When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far

Another star, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight
Wanna see us alight

Was it all in my fantasy?
Where are you now?
Were you only imaginary?

So lost, I'm faded, I'm faded
So lost, I'm faded

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea

I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

Some people lie but they're looking for magic
Others are quietly going insane
I feel alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same

[Chorus 2]
I know I could lie, but I won't lie to you
Wherever I go, you're the ghost in the room
I don't even try looking for something new
Cause wherever I go, I'll be looking for you

Some people try but they can't find the magic
Others get down on their knees and they pray
I come alive when I’m close to the madness
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

I know I could lie but I’m telling the truth
Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new
But wherever I go, I'll be looking for you
Wherever I go, I'll be looking for you, you

Some people pray to their god for some magic
Cause no easy love could ever make them feel the same
No easy love could ever make me feel the same
Make me feel the same, same, same

Wherever I go there’s a shadow of you
I know I could try looking for something new

What these bitches want from a nigga?

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'
[Chorus: Drake]
It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah

[Verse 2: Drake]
I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me
[Chorus: Drake]
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
What type of games are bein' played?
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?
Yeah
[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh
Tryna give your ass the world
You runnin' your fingers through my curls
You knew me when the kid had waves
But that's enough of that
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass
And that's some real shit"

And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport, leaving us all in your past
I traveled fifteen hundred miles to see you
Begged you to want me, but you didn’t want to

[Chorus]
But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old
And you know, he never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me, he loves me
Piece by piece, he restored my faith
That a man can be kind and a father could stay

[Verse 2]
And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn’t free, it has to be earned
Back then I didn’t have anything you needed, so I was worthless

But piece by piece, he collected me
Up off the ground, where you abandoned things, yeah
Piece by piece, he filled the holes that you burned in me

He takes care of me, 'cause he loves me

Because unlike you, I’m gonna put her first

He’ll take care of things, he’ll love her

Grandma and grandpa painted a picture
Of 65 years in one little house
More than a memory
More than saying I do
Kiss you goodnights

We’ll build our own family
One day at a time
10 little toes
A painted pink room
Our beautiful baby looks just like you

And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you
Just take my hand and I’ll be the man your dad hoped that I’d be
And we’ll build this love from the ground up
For worse or for better
And I will be all you need
Beside you I’ll stand through the good and the bad
We’ll give all that we have
And we’ll build this love from the ground up

This life will go by in the blink of an eye
But I wouldn’t wanna spend it without you by my side
The clouds are gonna roll
The earth’s gonna shake
But I’ll be your shelter
Through the wind and the rain

And we’ll build this love from the ground up
Now til forever it’s all of me, all of you

Wreckin' balls, downtown construction
Bottles breakin', jukebox buzzin'
Cardboard sign says ""The Lord is Comin'""
Tick, tick, tock
Rumors turn the mills back home
Parkin' lot kids with the speakers blown
We didn't turn it on but we can't turn it
Off, off, off

[Pre-Chorus]
Sometimes I wonder how did we get here
Seems like all we ever hear is noise

[Chorus]
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

[Verse 2]
24 hour television
Gets so loud that no one listens
Sex and money and politicians
Talk, talk, talk
But there really ain't no conversation
Ain't nothin' left to the imagination
Trapped in our phones and we can't make it
Stop, stop this noise
[Chorus]
Yeah we scream, yeah we shout 'til we don't have a voice
In the streets, in the crowds, it ain't nothin' but noise
Drownin' out all the dreams of this Tennessee boy
Just tryna be heard in all this noise

[Bridge]
Every room, every house, every shade of noise
All the floors, all the walls, they all shake with noise
We can't sleep, we can't think, can't escape the noise
We can't take the noise, so we just make noise

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

[Verse 1]
Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
[Refrain]
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
[Verse 2]
Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

[Chorus]
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, 5 star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard

What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately

Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you

Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me

Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me

Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy

Get meditated over ""Medicated""
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

[Verse 1]
I told moms I ain't trippin' over school cause I made it
Said, ""Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration""
Put a milli' in his bank account
Don't leave him out I was thinkin'
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby
Said a couple years later they can give it back to me
Technology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em
Switch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at

If you wanna give up, take a chance
When the party’s over, you should have the last dance
If there's no direction and you can’t see
Let your heart draw a map in the stars and go where it leads

[Chorus]
Cause I can give you hope
But I can’t show you how
Only you can turn the light on
Find your way back out
It may be dark and winding
But it leads you home
I know, yes, I know

There’s no shame, love, in falling apart
Nothing comes easy but it won’t always be
No, it won’t be always be so hard

Uh, sanırım bütün yüzünü yeni Chanellarla kaplamış

Ayağa kalkıp koca götünü Gucci pantolonuma koydu

Şişeler istediğini söyledi, masamız yok
Yatağının çerçevesi yok, masaları yok
Netflix izliyorduk, kablo tvsi yokmuş, pekala
Fiş, fiş, fiş, ben onu şarj ederim
Saçlarından tutup kapıyı onun için tutan bir zenciyi arzuluyor

Oh, Tanrım! Bana her gün yazıyor, cevap alamıyor
Kaltak, tepemi attırıyorsun
Bu altını bronza çevirmek gibi bir şey, gözlerimi deviriyorum

O bizim Clyde ve Bonnie olduğumuzu düşünüyor
Tanrım, beni affet! Tunechi F akıyorum, ben bir efsaneyim
Dosdoğru Crescent'tan

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

It's levels to it, you and I know

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, ""Come on over!""
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out (Hey)
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""I am not afraid to die"" (Yeah)
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge (Yeah)
All my friends are dead, yeah, ooh
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeah

[Verse 2]
That is not your swag, I swear you fake hard
Now these niggas wanna take my cadence
Rain on 'em, thunderstorm, rain on 'em (Ooh, yeah)
Medicine, lil' nigga, take some (Yeh, yeh)
Fast car, NASCAR, race on 'em
In the club, ain't got no ones, then we would beg them
Clothes from overseas, got the racks and they all C-Notes
You is not a G though
Lookin' at you stackin' all your money, it all green though
I was countin' that and these all twenties, that's a G-roll

[Bridge]
She say, ""You're the worst, you're the worst""
I cannot die because this my universe
[Chorus]
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, ""Baby, I am not afraid to die""

All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead

I met you in the dark
You lit me up
You made me feel as though
I was enough
We danced the night away
We drank too much
I held your hair back when
You were throwing up

[Pre-Chorus]
Then you smiled over your shoulder
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
I pulled you closer to my chest
And you asked me to stay over
I said, I already told ya
I think that you should get some rest

[Chorus 1]
I knew I loved you then
But you'd never know
'Cause I played it cool
When I was scared of letting go
I knew I needed you
But I never showed
But I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

[Verse 2]
I'll wake you up with some breakfast in bed
I'll bring you coffee
With a kiss on your head
And I'll take the kids to school
Wave them goodbye
And I'll thank my lucky stars for that night

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When you looked over your shoulder
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
I wanna dance with you right now, oh
And you look as beautiful as ever
And I swear that every day you'll get better
You make me feel this way somehow

[Chorus 2]
I'm so in love with you
And I hope you know
Darling your love is more
Than worth its weight in gold
We've come so far my dear
Look how we've grown
And I wanna stay with you
Until we're grey and old
Just say you won't let go
Just say you won't let go

I wanna live with you
Even when we're ghosts
'Cause you were always there for me
When I needed you most

I'm gonna love you till
My lungs give out
I promise 'til death we part
Like in our vows
So I wrote this song for you
Now everybody knows
That it's just you and me
Until we're grey and old

First time I seen her walk by, man I 'bout fell up out my chair
Had to get her number, it took me like six weeks
Now me and her go way back like Cadillac seats

Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed

Doin' fifteen in a thirty, I ain't in no hurry
I'ma take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans, she don't need no belt
But I can turn them inside out, I don't need no help
Got hips like honey, so thick and so sweet, man
And ain't no curves like hers on them downtown streets

Tangled up in the tall grass with my lips on hers

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown

Lookin' for a problem with my young goblins
I'ma send a model home with her neck throbbin'
I done made so much money that it's non-stoppin'
Got my brothers on my back like the last name
I remember tellin' everyone I couldn't be tamed
Woah, six months later, I had snapped and now I'm in the game
Went from fake chains to diamonds in another lane
Went from ""Can you take me here?"" to screenin' out the lane
Went from ""Damn, this nigga lame"" to remember my name
So I remember all the people who ain't fucked with me
They went to college, now all them niggas is history
I upgraded from gold to diamonds in my teeth
Ridin' deep in the van, like we lookin' for a mystery (Raggy?)
So don't fuck with me
No, lately I been livin' like luxury
Boat and Kyle stick together like piano keys
And on my mother's mother
I won't fuck a bitch without a damn rubber

I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand

But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you

We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spent the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current, as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us, just for a while
Do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish, to swim away with the fish
Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song

Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and

Seitdem ich mit dir gewesen bin, ooh
Es wird nicht mit dir funktionieren
Niemand kann mich gleich machen (Ich weiß)
Ich werde an diesem Drink nippen, wenn ich im Arsch bin
Ich sollte wissen wie man aufgabelt
Ich werde den Rhythmus bekommen
Während sie gegen mich drückt, ooh, ist sie angeschwipst?
Hatte genug Konversation für 24
Ich gucke dich durch den ganzen Raum an
Schöner kleiner Körper, tanzt wie Gogo, hey
Und du bist unvergessbar
Ich muss dafür sorgen, dass du alleine bist (oeh)
Warum nicht? Eine verdammt gute Zeit hat noch niemanden geschadet
Ich hab einen kleinen Drink, aber es nicht Barcadi
Wenn du das Mädchen liebtest, tut es mir sehr, sehr leid
Ich muss es ihr geben als wären wir in einer Ehe
Oh, als wären wir in Eile
Nein, nein, ich werde es niemanden erzählen

Sie will den Nachnamen mit dem Ring darauf
Weil ich holte eine Millionen raus, sagte ihr, sie soll drauf planken

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

[Verse 2]
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

[Pre-Chorus]
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
[Chorus]
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

[Bridge]
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

[Chorus]
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill"

They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy

Hadn't had a good time
Since you know when
Got talked into going out
With hopes you were staying in
I was feeling like myself for the first time
In a long time
'Til I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Verse 2]
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talking 'bout us again
If I would've just laid my drink down
And walked out
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
[Chorus]
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

[Bridge]
Yeah, you hit me Category 5
With your smile
Blew me away
And girl, it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside

[Chorus]
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
Baby, without warning
'Cause I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart storming
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane

You never let me get away
From all the memories that we made
I got rid of the triggers, burned the pictures
But somehow you find a way
I woke up this morning, not thinking about you
Like I've taught myself to do
But in the still of the silence
I'm reminded of you...

And just like that, it all comes back
Déjà vu

Oh...
Here I go again from the beginning
And, oh...

The slamming doors and broken glass

It all comes back to...

I won't ever get used to watching me lose you
Over and over again

But up here in my head
I see you close on the carpet, your arms all around me
On the floor in the living room
And I almost believed that
I'm really here with you

Cold enough to chill my bones

I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say

744,2017,Alessia Cara,Scars To Your Beautiful,"[Verse 1]
She just wants to be beautiful
She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits
She craves attention, she praises an image
She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made

[Chorus]
But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Verse 2]
She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving
You know, covergirls eat nothing
She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything""
""What's a little bit of hunger?""
""I can go a little while longer,"" she fades away
She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it
Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface, oh, oh
So to all the girls that's hurting, let me be your mirror
Help you see a little bit clearer the light that shines within
[Chorus]
There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful

[Bridge]
No better you than the you that you are
No better you than the you that you are
No better life than the life we're living
No better life than the life we're living
No better time for your shine, you're a star
No better time for your shine, you're a star
Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful

[Chorus]
And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change its heart
No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful"

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
[Verse 2: Kiiara]
You say that I'm paranoid
But I’m pretty sure the world is out to get me
It’s not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
[Chorus: Kiiara]
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything’s about me

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Kiiara]
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?"

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

What if I told you about my little nothing town?
The two room house where I came from
The man that I got my name from
I don't even know where he is now

[Verse 2]
What if I told you sometimes I lose my faith?
I wonder why someone like you would even talk to me
What if I told you there's no fixing me
'Cause everybody's already tried

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you stay? Would you leave?
I could wait, it'll all come out eventually

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Would you look the other way, could you love me anyway?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you I don't plan on staying here?
My dreams are a million miles away
And I know your family's gonna want you to stay
You know what? I don't blame them
[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll say what I don't want to
And I'll just pray you want what I do, mhmm

[Chorus]
If I told you all the stupid things I've done
I blamed on being young
But I was old enough to know, I know
If I told you the mess that I can be
When there's no one there to see
Could you look the other way, could you love me anyway?
Oh, could you love me anyway?

[Bridge]
So before we go any further here
Let a week turn into another year
There's some things you probably don't wanna hear
But you have to

[Outro]
If I told you sometimes I get jealous
Sometimes I'm half crazy
Would you say the hell with me, the hell with me?
If I told you I barely know what love is
But girl, if that's what this is
I don't wanna let it slip away, oh, no, no, no
Could you love me anyway, please?
Could you love me anyway?
Could you love me anyway, ooh?
Could you love me anyway?"

I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?
I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down

Ich bin im Tief gewesen
Ich hab mir Zeit gelassen
Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren

Wer kann es verstehen?
Ich bin im Tief gewesen

Ich fühle mich als hab ich meinen Verstand verloren
Es fühlt sich an als wäre mein Leben nicht meins

Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will heute einfach sterben
Ich will einfach sterben
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will nicht lebendig sein
Ich will einfach sterben
Und lass mich dir sagen warum

[Strophe 1: Logic]
All der andere Scheiß, über den ich rede, sie denken sie wissen es
Ich habe gebetet, damit mich jemand rettet, keiner ist heldenhaft
Und mein  Leben bedeutet nichts
Ich weiß es, ich weiß es, ich weiß, dass ich tief in mir verletzt bin, aber kann es nicht zeigen
Ich hatte nie einen Ort, den ich mein Eigen nennen konnte
Ich hatte nie ein Zuhause
Keiner ruft mein Handy an
Wo warst du? Wo bist du? Was geht in dir vor?
Sie sagen jedes Leben ist wertvoll, doch interessiert sich für meins

[Strophe 2: Alessia Cara]
Es ist der erste Atemzug
Wenn dein Kopf im Wasser untergegangen ist
Und die Leichtheit in der Luft
Wenn du da bist
Brust zu Brust mit einem Geliebten
Es ist Weitermachen, auch wenn der Weg lang ist
Und Licht in den dunkelsten Dingen zu sehen
Und wenn du deine Reflektion anstarrst
Endlich zu wissen wer es ist
Ich weiß, dass du Gott danken wirst, dass du es getan hast
[Stropge 3: Logic]
Ich weiß wo du warst, wo du bist, wohin du gehst
Ich wieß, dass du der Grund bist, warum ich ans Leben glaube
Was ist der Tag mit einer kleinen Nacht?
Es kann schwer sein
Es kann so schwer sein
Aber du musst jetzt leben
Du musst jetzt alles geben

Schmerz tut nicht so weh, ich weiß
Die Spur, die ich fahre, fühlt sich einsam an
Aber ich bewege mich bis meine Beine aufgeben
Und ich sehe meine Tränen im Schnee schmelzen
Aber ich will nicht weinen
Ich will nicht mehr weinen
Ich will mich lebendig fühlen
Ich will sogar nicht mehr sterben
Oh ich will nicht
Ich will nicht

Helluva made this beat, baby

[Chorus]
These niggas prayed on my downfall (They what?)
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

[Verse]
Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Let's keep that water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Mu, 'member when you had them green things mailed?
With vacuum seals, tryin' not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money?
I don't know nothin', I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches, my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers comin' in and out of court
Ayy, Dwan, though, ayy, Theo, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Ayy, JR, nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened? (We did that bitch, nigga)
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro, kill me if I snitch, 'cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill ya
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas ho me? Quit bein' silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, ""Get ahead of them niggas!""
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders
(Boom-Boom-Boom!)
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? Ayy, I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch, I'm 2-0
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on
[Chorus]
I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch, I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball"

I can honestly understand why it's over
I can go through the motions of walking away
I can give you the key and take my things back
I can find plenty things to fill my days

[Chorus]
But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help
The way I still want you
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to
I just don't know how not to
How not to
How not to

You're like second nature, baby, you're just like breathing
Melody that you hear and you can't forget
Time goes by and I still need you
Yeah, you're worth the heartbreak and the regret

But I don't know how not to
Think about you
When it's late at night and quiet
And I know that I ought to be the one who
Is strong and just moves on
But I'd probably turn down your road
Knock, knock on your door
Fall back in your arms
Wake up in the morning
Hatin' myself and the way that I can't help

768,2017,Russ,Losin Control,"[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

Where the corn grows, up to the roadside
Went to high school here, got that Panther pride
She'll be cheering them on every Friday night

Couldn't help but shine with a heart like that

But she never forgot, where she came from

With a ribbon tying back those waterfall curls
I've been looking all over, all over the world
For a pretty little homegrown hometown girl

And her roots run deeper than that old town square
She's a good girl, but she's not uptight

I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh

It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away

Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

But boy, you're gonna come back home
You're gonna settle down
But you won't feel the way I'm feelin' now
Til you have a boy
He's gonna know it all
He'll think he's ten feet tall
And run like he's bulletproof
And total a car or two"

[Intro]
Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte, que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro cómo dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

[Pre-Coro]
Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé y no me luce
Todo es por usted

[Coro]
Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te siente' mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te siente' fría
Mami, yo me siento tuyo (Oh)
Yo sé que tú te siente' mía (Ah)
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

[Post-Coro]
Te caliento má', má', má'
Te caliento má', má', má'
Te caliento más, má', má'
Te caliento má', má', má'
Te caliento má'
[Verso 1]
Solo una cosa te preguntaré
Si tiene' frío, ¿Quién te da calor?
Yo soy el dueño de tus fantasía'
Nadie lo hace como yo
Si te viste' bonita, él no te dice na'
Y a mí, tú me gusta' hasta sin maquillar
Tú siempre a mí me dice' que él te trata mal
Y eso lo tienes que acabar

[Puente]
Dime qué tú vas a hacer
Mami, tengo la inquietud
Si quieres sufrir con él, eso lo decides tú
¿Que serás feliz con él? Yo no te contestaré
Sé que me vas a llamar cuando me extrañe tu piel (Tu piel)

[Coro]
Ma-Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te siente' mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te siente' fría
Mami, yo me siento tuyo (Oh)
Yo sé que tú te siente' mía (Ah)
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

""No thank you"" is what I should've said
I should be in bed
But temptations of trouble on my tongue
Troubles yet to come

[Pre-Chorus]
One sip, bad for me
One hit, bad for me
One kiss, bad for me
But I give in so easily
And ""no thank you"" is how it should've gone
I should stay strong

But I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that
I'm weak, and what's wrong with that?
Boy, oh boy I love it when I fall for that

Ooh waaaaaaa ee ya ee ya

No thank you

My habits, they hold me like a grudge
I promise I won't budge

796,2017,Chris Stapleton,Either Way,"[Verse 1]
We pass in the hall
On our way to separate rooms
The only time we ever talk
Is when the monthly bills are due

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We go to work, we go to church
We fake the perfect life
I'm past the point of give a damn
And all my tears are cried

[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way

[Verse 2]
It's been so long since I've felt
Anything inside these walls
You can't hate and you can't hurt
When you don't feel at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I used to cry and stay up nights
And wonder what went wrong
And it's been hard
But hearts can only do that for so long
[Chorus]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
I won't love you either way

[Outro]
We can just go on like this
Say the word, we'll call it quits
Baby, you can go or you can stay
But I won't love you either way"
797,2017,Zac Brown Band,My Old Man,"[Verse 1]
He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be like my old man

[Verse 2]
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man

[Chorus]
My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man
[Verse 3]
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man

[Break]

[Chorus]
My old man
I know one day we'll meet again
As he's looking down
My old man
I hope he's proud of who I am
I'm trying to fill the boot of my old man

I guess you heard I was pedal to the metal on a downhill slide
Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

[Verse 2]
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did

[Chorus]
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
Tryin' to drown
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool

Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone

My cousins are crazy, my cousins like Boogie
Life is amazin', it is what it should be
Been here for ten but I feel like a rookie
I tell her, ""Look up"" 'cause it's snowin' in Tootsie's
Booked for three years, man, you can't even book me
It's me and Lil Baby, this shit goin' crazy
Wheezy produced it and Weezy F. made me
And she held it down, so she got a Mercedes
Young Money Records, the Army, the Navy
They ran me ten thousand, I threw it like Brady
The foreign is yellow like Tracee and K.D
I trusted my niggas, they never betrayed me
Met all these niggas, they sweeter than Sadie
When I started out, I just took what they gave me
Did all the favors, they never repaid me
It worked in my favor, 'cause nobody saved me

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake

You found another— better one

Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain
Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane
Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight
Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus]

Sneakin' in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, ""Stop playin' it safe
Girl, I wanna see you lose control""

Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

816,2018,Ed Sheeran,Perfect,"[Verse 1]
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

[Chorus]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
[Chorus 2]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight"
817,2018,Imagine Dragons,Whatever It Takes,"[Verse 1]
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Negative, nepotist
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Verse 2]
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this

[Pre-Chorus]
Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
[Bridge]
Hypocritical, egotistical
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm an apostrophe
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes

[Chorus]
Whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Whatever it takes
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes"

Yeah
I'm working on dying

Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Verse 1]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check
[Verse 2]
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)

Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)

She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold

Swear to God, I'm down if you're down, all you gotta say is ""Right""
Girl, anything I can do just to make you feel alright

Care for me, care for me, care for me, uh

I wanna get married, like the Currys, Steph and Ayesha shit
But we more like Belly—Tommy and Keisha shit
Gave you TLC, you wanna creep and shit
Poured out my whole heart to a piece of shit
Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives
I could've did what you did to me to you a few times
But if I did decide to slide, find a nigga
Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed
But that's not my M.O., I'm not that type of bitch
And karma for you is gon' be who you end up with
You make me sick, nigga

[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'
Be careful with me
Yeah, my heart is like a package with a fragile label on it
Be careful with me
[Bridge]
Care for me, care for me
Always said that you'd be there for me, there for me
Boy, you better treat me carefully, carefully, look

[Verse 2]
I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this lust got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we started switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga
[Chorus]
The only man, baby, I adore
I gave you everything, what's mine is yours
I want you to live your life of course
But I hope you get what you dyin' for
Be careful with me, do you know what you doin'?
Whose feelings that you're hurtin' and bruisin'?
You gon' gain the whole world
But is it worth the girl that you're losin'?
Be careful with me
Yeah, it's not a threat, it's a warnin'

I’ma go and see a movie and relax (woo)
Ayy, I’m a Blood but I can finally wear blue (cool)
Why his momma calling all the time?
Leave me the fuck alone, bitch
Wait, if I’m in Dicky’s body, Breezy is who?
Hope my daughter’s in school
Fuck, if I was Chris Brown, where would I be?
What would I do?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
I can’t believe that it’s Freaky Friday
Yeah, it’s Freaky Friday
I’m in Chris Brown's body
I look at my soft dick with delight, it’s my dream dick
[Verse 3: Lil Dicky & Chris Brown]
If I was Lil Dicky in my body, where would I be?
I’m tryna to find myself like an introspective monk
I’m balling on the court, oh my god I can dunk
Snap a flick of my junk
My dick is trending on Twitter? Fuck
Now I’m at the club, I talked my way into getting in
I look up in the VIP, my goodness there I am
I signal to him to let me in but he won’t let me in
I don’t know who that is
Wait, who the fuck he think he is?
Took a glass bottle, shatter it on the bouncer's head (woo)
Walked up to that motherfucker
Wait, think it through for a sec
If you hurting me then you only hurting yourself
But wait, I love myself
That was the key, now we're switching back

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I woke up in Chris Brown’s body (oh yeah)
Somehow this shit turned into Freaky Friday
But we got no choice but to turn this bitch sideways
(I can't believe)
I can’t believe that it’s Freaky Friday

[Outro]
Lil Dicky: Wait, what the fuck?
Ed Sheeran: And now I'm in Ed Sheeran’s body
It’s way less cool than being Chris Brown was
Lil Dicky: What the fuck again?
DJ Khaled: I’m DJ Khaled
Why am I yelling?
Kendall Jenner: Huh, I'm Kendall Jenner
I got a vagina, I’m gonna explore that right now (woo, woo)
Holy shit, I got a vagina (uh), I'm gonna learn
I’m gonna understand the inner workings of a woman"

I'm always ready for a war again
Go down that road again
It's all the same
I'm always ready to take a life again
You know I'll ride again
It's all the same (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone

Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?

If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? (Hero)
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? (Hero)
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be
[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see

If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

Everything came second to the Benzo
You're not even speakin' to my friends, no
You knew all my uncles and my aunts though
Twenty candles, blow 'em out and open your eyes
We were lookin' forward to the rest of our lives
Used to keep my picture posted by your bedside
Now it's in your dresser with the socks you don't like
And I'm rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
With my brothers like it's Jonas, Jonas
Drinkin' Henny and I'm tryna forget
But I can't get this shit outta my head

He seemed like he was pretty cool
I was so broken over you
Life, it goes on, what can you do?
I just wonder what it's gonna take (What's it gonna take?)
Another foreign or a bigger chain (Bigger chain)
Because no matter how my life has changed
I keep on looking back on better days

You prolly think that you are better now, better now
You only say that 'cause I'm not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything
You know I say that I am better now, better now
I only say that 'cause you're not around, not around
You know I never meant to let you down, let you down
Woulda gave you anything, woulda gave you everything

Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice

From calling to you

But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
Girl, I confess
I lied when I said
""I'm leaving and not coming back""
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
[Verse 2]
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on

Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm

[Verso 9: Jennifer Lopez]
You got it all twisted
I checked out a long time ago
Texting, you missed it
Touch it, had enough that
She got you sprung
So I pulled up, they start a case of charity
After you begging me, begging for company
Never needed you, you only needed me
All that talk just to settle being weak
Had too much tequila, so save that shit for the next one
It goes in one ear, and out the next one
Said you put me out, why you lying?
I left on my own, had you crying
I was tryna keep your bidness silent
Tried to keep the peace instead of being violent
Thought we squashed the bygones and remained friends?
Truth be told, you're the one that's high maintenance
Let's be real, I threw you out
¿El a-El anillo pa' cuándo?
But your time ran out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Se te viraron, ahora jangueo con tus amigas (Yeah)
Me hiciste una querella y yo bebiendo Ron (Tra-tra-tra-tra)
Con el batallón, todo' los días de misión (¡Duro!)
Siempre hablando mierda pero no me importa tu opinión
Yo soy caro y tu novio nuevo es tremendo mamón (¡Prende!)
Prepárame el bo-bo-bote (Bote)
Sólo mujeres con escote, el VIP en el camarote (Bom, bom)
DJ, súbele el bajo para que to' eso rebote (Bom)
Tráeme cuatro botellas pa' que la nota le explote

[Verso 13: Nio García]
Y la vida me ha enseñado que donde hubo fuego cenizas quedan (Bebé)
Yo te boté de mi corazón y ya ahí de ti nada queda, te boté
Eres de las que espera que la nota le suba
Le pedí al DJ que le ponga la de Guatauba
Que no le baje después que la suba
Que ella quiere olvidarme y al eco le pidió ayuda
Botella' de Rosé, eh, han baja'o como doce
Ella dice que la boté y, pero te la dejé

Aprovecho el remix con Ozu' para mandarte pa'l carajo también

No quiero mentira' ni tu falsedad

I can still shut down a party
I can hang with anybody

Little Scotch on the rocks and I'm fine, I'm fine

But when I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt
The same one you wore when we were
Sky high in Colorado, your lips pressed against the bottle
Swearing on a Bible, baby, I'd never leave ya
I remember how bad I need ya
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)
When I taste tequila (When I, when I, when I)

I can kiss somebody brand new
And not even think about you
I can show up to the same bar
Hear the same songs in my car
Baby, your memory, it only hits me this hard

When I taste tequila
Baby, I still see ya
Cuttin' up the floor in a sorority T-shirt

Took you like a shot
Thought that I could chase you with a cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it
Even though I do (even though I do)

You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you

You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you

I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you

We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me ('cause it's not me, 'cause it's not me)

Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say

I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sounds wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the days
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
[Verse 2: Skepta]
Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard (Yeah)
I listened to X, I peeped the bars (Yeah)
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart (Yeah)
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Skepta]
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless
[Chorus: Skepta]
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours

Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?

I ain't no bad person, no
Ayy I ain't no gangster, ain't no killer
I ain't no gangbanger, I'm me
Like everybody make mistakes, that's life
Name one fuckin' person who ain't make mistakes, you feel me?
Man like we, I don't know what to say
I don't know if I'm targeted
I don't know if it's from what I speak about, like I don't know
I just know shit, until I'm dead I'ma be me
Yeah, yeah
And they ain't never seen this shit before

38 Baby

[Verse]
Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier
I'm poppin' X so I'm steady rollin'
Say he a gangster, got his chest out
When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (shoot 'em up yeah, yeah)
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose (fill 'em up yeah, yeah)
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it
It's all bronze like a penny, only see fire when I spit it
I ain't shoot this bitch in a minute, a nigga play, he can get it
Double G, that stand for gang, you niggas know how we livin'"

Met a man wearin' a T-shirt, says ""Virginia is for lovers""
Had a Bible in his left hand and a bottle in the other
He said ""All you're really given is the sunshine and your name""
We both started laughin' when the sky started to rain

Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along

[Verse 2]
Saw a model on a billboard, 1-800 get to know me
Wondered was she Photoshopped, or were her eyes really that lonely?
Did she leave her hometown thinkin' she'd end up in L.A.?
Did she break down in the desert and get stuck beside the highway?

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand
Paint a wall, learn to dance
Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along
[Bridge]
You'll find out when you die the keys to Heaven can't be bought
We still don't know what love is but we sure know what it's not
Sometimes you got to

[Chorus]
Get along, on down the road
We've got a long long way to go
Scared to live, scared to die
We ain't perfect but we try
Get along while we can
Always give love the upper hand

Call your mom, buy a boat
Drink a beer, sing a song
Make a friend, can't we all get along"

Gang! Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on my name, don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang, A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang! They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name but this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang! They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K but I do not fuck with no Klans

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game!

[Verse]
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, ""Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind""
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose
[Pre-Chorus]
I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack
I got the boof by the pack
I fucked your boo on her back

[Chorus]
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang
It's time to fuck up the whole game! (Game, game, game, game)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky + Khloe Anna]
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow (Gang, gang)
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
[Outro: Khloe Anna + Moby]
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you (then and now)
I never meant to lie"
863,2018,Foster The People,Sit Next To Me,"[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's over, it's over, I'm circling these vultures
Got me praying, man, this hunger, and feeling something rotten
Last time I saw you, said ""What's up?"" and pushed right through
Then I tried to catch you but we're always on the move
And now it's over, we're sober, symptoms of the culture
And the night ain't getting younger, last call's around the corner
Feeling kinda tempted and I'm pouring out the truth
Just fading out these talkers 'cause now all I want is you
Just sayin'

[Chorus]
Come over here and sit next to me
We can see where things go naturally
Just say the word and I'll part the sea
Just come over here and sit next to me, ooh-ooh-ooh
And I'll take you high
High, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I ain't frontin' my intention, got your man outlined in chalk
It's a midnight intervention, got no plans to make it stop
Last time I saw you, said you wanna keep it light
But I'm here to tell you I'm not trying to change your mind
It's alright, ooh-ooh-ooh
It's alright, ooh-ooh-ooh

Yeah, come over here and sit next to me

Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

[Verse]
The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it
Habla en español, I ""y tu"" it
Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily
The only rapper sold more dope than me was Eazy-E
How could you ever right these wrongs
When you don't even write your songs?
But let us all play along
We all know what niggas for real been waitin' on
Push

I do, so, yeah
Infrared, yeah, you know what I mean?

She rattled the ice in my plastic cup
I said ""yes m'am"", fill her up
Tell me something good that I don't know
'Cause this world's been kicking my behind
Life ain't been a friend of mine
Lately I've been feeling kinda low

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And she looked back over her shoulder
Pointed at the sign hanging up on the wall
It said

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
And nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hittin' that panic button
It ain't worth spilling your drink
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

So I nodded my head and said, ""that's for sure""
Dropped a few bucks in the mason jar
Felt those good old neon vibes on me
And whatever monkey that was on my back
He jumped off just like that
Right into the deep blue sea
[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I looked back over her shoulder
Thinking 'bout the sign hanging up on the wall
That said

[Chorus]
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright
Nobody's gotta worry 'bout nothing
Don't go hitting that panic button
It ain't near as bad as you think
Everything's gonna be alright
Alright, alright

[Intro - Halsey]
Si je

[Couplet 1 - Halsey]
Il a dit qu'il a essayé de me téléphoner, mais je n'ai jamais le temps
Il a dit que je n'écoute jamais, mais je n'essaie même pas
J'ai eu un nouvel endroit à Cali, mais je suis parti tous les soirs
Alors je le remplis d'étrangers pour qu'ils restent allumés
Elle a dit qu'elle vous a dit qu'elle me connaît, mais le visage ne va pas
Elle a demandé si je la reconnaissais et je lui ai dit que ça serai possible

[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Tu peux voir, partout où je vais
J'ai un million de personnes différentes qui essaient d'être avec moi
Mais je suis toujours seul dans mon esprit, oh

[Refrain - Halsey]
Je sais que t'as d'envie de me rencontrer
Mais je peux seulement te dire ça
Bébé, dès que tu me rencontres
Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais
(Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais)

[Couplet 2 - Big Sean]
Unh, regarde
Je suis un vrai individu rare
Je suis dans le physique et le métaphysique (ouais)
Je sais que vous avez besoin de votre temps seul, c'est essentiel
Mais j'ai besoin de votre temps, est-ce que je suis hypocrite?
Tu sais que je peux relier avec vous plus qu'avec ma famille
Donc je ne vais pas m'asseoir et te laisser couler dans les sables mouvants
Je sais que vous avez des plans de millions de dollars
Et vous essayez de construire une marque, vivre une vie en forte demande
Détourant des grands Bs, votre sac a des petits Gs
Gucci jusqu'aux chaussettes comme Biggie et Little Ceas
Allons aux Maldives et cachons-nous derrière des palmiers
Petit vin rouge, mauvaise herbe et une brise calme
Car bébé, tu vis la vie à l'intérieur d'une bulle
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous embrasse?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez eu quelqu'un qui vous aime?
Quand était la dernière fois que vous avez aimé quelqu'un qui vous aime?
[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Tu sais que partout où je vais
J'ai un million de personnes différentes qui essaient d'être avec moi
Mais je suis toujours seul dans mon esprit, oh

Je sais que t'as d'envie de me rencontrer
Mais je peux seulement te dire ça
Bébé, dès que tu me rencontres
Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais

[Couplet 3 - Stefflon Don]
Rester debout et m'avoir toute la nuit sur le support
Vous savez que nous disons, j'ai la conversation la plus méchante
Tu me dis toujours, dis que je suis pleine d'attitude
Et tu n'aimes pas mon amie parce qu'elle est grossière
J'arrive dans le Benz avec tout en or
Fenêtre en bas parce que vous devez me voir avec mon roi
Qu'est-ce que tu sirotais, je trempe, maintenant tu pars d'une aventure
Je vais couper votre aile, tadah

[Pre-Refrain - Halsey]
Tu peux voir, partout où je vais
J'ai un million de personnes différentes qui essaient d'être avec moi
Mais je suis toujours seul dans mon esprit, oh
[Refrain - Halsey]
Je sais que t'as d'envie de me rencontrer
Mais je peux seulement te dire ça
Bébé, dès que tu me rencontres
Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais
(Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais)

[Outro - Halsey]
(Je sais que tu veux, je, je sais que tu veux)
Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais

Oh (je sais que tu veux, je, je sais que tu veux)
Vous souhaiterez que vous n'avez jamais"
870,2018,Blake Shelton,I Lived It,"[Verse 1]
Daddy drove the wheels off a flatbed Ford
Flies found a hole in the old screen door
Granny said the dress that my sister wore
To church wasn't long enough
Mama poured grease in a Crisco can
Put a hundred thousand miles on a Sears box fan
Uncle Joe put tobacco on my hand
Where them yellow jackets torn me up
And I ain't making this up

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy smoked Salems with the windows up
Drove me around in the back of that truck
We drank from the hose and spit in the cup
We all survived somehow
Them ol' Duke boys were flattening the hills
Hollywood was fake, wrestling was real
Wouldn't dream of spending that two dollar bill
From pushing a lawn mower around
I'd go back there right now
[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it

[Chorus]
Oh, you think I'm talking crazy in a different language
You might not understand
Oh, that's alright, that's just the kind of life
That made me who I am
Just taking my mind on a visit, back in time 'cause I miss it
You wouldn't know to love it like I love it
Unless you lived it and man, I lived it
Oh man, I lived it"

Mercy
Why you gotta show up lookin' so good just to hurt me?
Why you wanna stop this whole damn world from turning?
Mercy
Why you hanging on so tight if this ain't working?
Why you wanna stop this flame if it's still burning?
Cause it's still burning

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy

[Verse 2]
If you go out tonight and get drunk and lonely
Wind up home alone please don't call me
And say you miss me, no

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Have mercy
[Bridge]
Woah
Oh have mercy

[Chorus]
If you're gonna break my heart, just break it
If you're gonna take your shot, take it
Take it
Oh if you're gonna break my heart, just break it
And if you're gonna take your shot, then take it
Take it
If you made up your mind, then make it
But make this fast
If you ever loved me
Mmmh if you ever loved me
Have mercy
Oh have mercy
Oh have mercy
Have mercy"

Pullin' up in that new toy
The wrist on that boy rockstar like Pink Floyd
Waving at rude boy, I'm wavin' at you, boy
Ran off on the plug too like Trugoy
Imagine me do-boy, you could never do what I do, boy
Still, duckin' shit that I did, boy
Niggas in Paris 'fore Hit-Boy
These ain't the same type of hits, boy
Shit can get litter than lit, boy
You don't take these type of risks, boy
'Cause this boy been throwin' that D like Rich Boy
You missed, boy; ya numbers don't add up on the blow
That was ten years ago – if you know, you know (Yeah)

This thing of ours, oh, this thing of ours
A fraternity of drug dealers ringin' off
I just happen to be alumni
Too legit, they still lookin' at me with one eye
The company I keep is not corporate enough
Child Rebel Soldier, you ain't orphan enough
A rapper turned trapper can't morph into us
But a trapper turned rapper can morph into Puff
Dance contest for the smokers
I predict snow, Al Roker

I only ever looked up to Sosa
You all get a bird, this nigga Oprah
[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door's supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for
Circle round twice for the encore
(If you know, you know)

[Verse 3]
You ever been hit with the water weight
Then had to weigh, ""Do you war or wait?""
(If you know, you know)
When we all clickin' like Golden State
And you and your team are the motorcade
(If you know, you know)
Been grantin' wishes like a genie
Two bad hoes in two-piece bikinis
I've been hidin' where you can see me
The skybox is right next to RiRi's
Solely responsible for showin' rappers how to stand
On the front lines when trappers started throwin' bands
Where were you when Big Meech brought the tigers in?
'Cause I was busy earnin' stripes like a tiger's skin
[Chorus]
Bricklayers in ball shorts
Coachin' from the side of the ball courts
(If you know, you know)
One stop like a Walmart
We got the tennis balls for the wrong sport
(If you know, you know)
If you know 'bout the carport
The trap door supposed to be awkward
(If you know, you know)
That's the reason we ball for

You be thinkin' what New Kids on the Block do
If you ain't drivin' while Black, do they stop you?
Will MAGA hats let me slide like a drive-thru?
That phone call from Ricky still hazy
When heaven got an angel named Avery
You gotta watch who you callin' crazy
Yeezy, the newest billion-dollar baby
It won't feel right 'til I feel like Phil Knight
Goin' for six rings like what Phil told Mike
Seven pill nights, who know what that feel like?
No more hidin' the scars, I show 'em like Seal, right?
How do you respond?"

You say you never danced to a dashboard singin' R.E.M. under summer stars
Never leaned back on a jet black Chevy, blowing smoke rings in the dark
You don't want to be a rumor, girl, and I feel just the same
Yeah, I know that you don't know me well but we can make that change

Like a real life, let your hair down, feel alive
When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Say you never drank from the bottle of some two dollar wine, run barefoot through the mud
Never had the right kiss stolen from your lips, while you watched the sun come up
Well, I know your friends are watching and they probably disapprove
But give me just half a chance, girl, I'm daring you

When was the last time you did something for the first time?

When was the last time you did something for the first time?

Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced out watch

Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot

Hit your girl, that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie
Someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie
Link up, make a check bleed

I ain't heard you laugh like that in a long time
I wonder if you stopped his world like you did mine just now
I see you sippin' white wine instead of whiskey

Well, I'm sorry if I'm overstepping boundaries
I don't mean to be, but I've just got to tell you how I feel

Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood

As bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

I believe them streets of gold are worth the work
But I'd still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt

Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

I believe most people are good
And most mamas oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better under neon or stadium lights

Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of

I believe that days go slow and years go fast
And every breath's a gift, the first one to the last

It was years ago
We were singing every word on the radio
Kinda like them songs could save our souls
Somehow, someway
We was falling fast
We was jumping in
Blue jean halo hanging off the limb
Two American kids just like them
Every time they played
And it blew us away

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?
Like we did then
Like we did when
Do you close your eyes?
Does it make you laugh?
Do the memories take you back
To six packs and a Chevy Cheyenne?
Way back
When I was Jack and you were Diane
Yeah, and the music played

Yeah, we were never growing up and growing old
Breaking up or letting go
Girl's just like Rock-n-Roll
Where has it gone?
But I hope like hell every now and again
I blow across your mind like that summer wind
And you're holding on to 16 as long as you can
Every time that it comes on

Do you turn it up?
Do you sing along
Every time you hear that song?

Like we did when

This is a Golden Remix (Oh-oh-oh)
King

[Verso 1: Romeo Santos]
Calculan que relaciones que fracasan, mayormente es por desengaño
Falsedad que contamina y hace daño
Tú fuiste perfecto clavel que con mis manos marchité
Mi obra se llama ""Romeo sin Julieta otra vez""
Puedes pensar soy el rey de las mentiras
Volvería a fallar, aunque lo jure por mi vida
Mis palabras no importan ni valen ni de rodilla, na' 'e na'
Dice que ha visto muchas novelas y el actor debe llorar

[Refrán: Romeo Santos]
¡No!, ¿ahora qué hago?
Ozuna y yo somos farsantes, nos ahogamo' en el fracaso
¡No!, no juro en vano
Jamás yo vuelvo a ser infiel con chapiadoras, yo te amo
¡No!, escúchame esta pena que siento
Voy a hacer otro disco con Aventura y te lo dedico enterito

[Coro: Ozuna & Romeo Santos]
Bebé
Si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante (-sante)
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé
Si todavía me amas como antes
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé
[Verso 2: Ozuna]
Sin ti yo no me vuelvo a enamorar, no sé ni qué pensar
Ya sé porque todo me sale mal
Mentí diciéndote que era leal, siendo un amor real
Le pido a Dios me pueda perdonar
No quiero que te vaya', vamo' a intentarlo
¿Por qué no salvamo' nuestra relación?
Tú sabe', bebé
Perdona, bebé

[Coro: Romeo Santos & Ozuna]
Ey, bebé
Si todavía me amas como ante'
Ya nada me parece interesante
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé (Eh)
Si todavía me amas como ante' (¡Eh!)
Ya nada me parece interesante (-sante)
Yo sé que en el amor soy un farsante
Yo sin ti no vuelvo a enamorarme, bebé

[Pre-Coro: Ozuna]
Extraño tu aroma en la cama
De ese que dejas cuando entras y sales
¿Dónde quedaron los beso' y todos los planes? (Oh-oh-oh)
No sé si vivir o morir
Me encuentro en un limbo desde que te fuiste de aquí (Oh, oh)
Ere' la única persona que yo quiero que se venga encima de mí
Mi libertad no la quiero, tampoco la vida de soltero (Oh, oh)
Yo lo que quiero es que quieran lo mismo que todos queremo' (Oh, oh)
Tener una cuenta de banco con dígitos y muchos cero' (Eh, eh)
Hacer el amor a diario y de paso, gastar el dinero

Dime, bebé

Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

[Verse 1]
This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 2]
To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code
[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

[Verse 3]
Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outer Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

[Refrain]
These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes, yah!"

Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes

She'll pity the men I know

Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feelin' so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinkin' you could live without me

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)

Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet

Ain't no budget when I'm on the set

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day, we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we've begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that this story ends

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we ran our course, we pretended we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swim
Far away from the wreck we made

You good, T-Minus?

[Refrain]
Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

[Verse 1]
I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up

I just broke her off with a 10-piece, dawg (10-piece, dawg)
That ain't nothin', I'm just bein' friendly, dawg

[Chorus: Drake]
It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it
If you really wanna ball 'til you fall
When your back against the wall
And a bunch of niggas need you to go away
Still goin' bad on 'em anyway
Saw you last night, but did it broad day
[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, lot of Murakami in the hallway (What?)
Got a sticky and I keep it at my dawg's place
Girl, I left your love at Magic, now it's all shade

Put some bands all on your head like Jason Terry (Brrt, brrt, ooh)
Richard Mille cost a Lambo (That's a Lambo)
Known to keep the baddest bitches on commando (Salute)
Every time I'm in my trap, I move like Rambo (Extended)
Ain't a neighborhood in Philly that I can't go (That's a Fendi)
For real
She said, ""Oh, you rich rich?"" (""You rich rich"")
Bitch, I graduated, call me ""Big Fish"" (Marlin)
I got Lori Harvey on my wish list (That's Lori)
That's the only thing I want for Christmas (True story, uh)
I've been had my way out here, yeah, know that's facts (Facts)
You ain't livin' that shit you say, yeah, we know that's cap (That's cap)
You ain't got to ask me when you see me, know I'm strapped (Brrt)

It's just a lil' 10-piece for her
Just to blow it in the mall, doesn't mean that we're involved
I just... what? I just... uh, put a Richard on the card
I ain't grow up playin' ball, but I'll show you how the fuck you gotta do it

Uh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Khalid]
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough (Yeah)
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus (Yeah)
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid]
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah

[Chorus: Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
[Verse 2: Halsey]
Seventeen, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned twenty-three
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey]
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing

[Chorus: Halsey & Khalid]
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me

[Chorus: Polo G]
We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it’s gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I’m sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hit your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing

Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don’t get banged
’Cause they'll do that job for me while I hop on a plane

[Verse 1: Polo G]
She don’t like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands got a blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it’s Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten' up yo' shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

Swear I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang (They go crazy for the game)
If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same (You won't look at me the same)
Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make (Wish I never had to make)
Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate (I just seen him graduate)
Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes (I'm just rollin' past jakes)
Both my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state (State) 'cause I had a bag to make (Bag to make)

928,2019,Halsey,Nightmare,"[Intro]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord, my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul to take

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Verse 1]
I've tasted blood and it is sweet
I've had the rug pulled beneath my feet
I've trusted lies and trusted men
Broke down and put myself back together again
Stared in the mirror and punched it to shatters
Collected the pieces and picked out a dagger
I've pinched my skin in between my two fingers
And wished I could cut some parts off with some scissors

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Post-Chorus]
I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night
That I'm no sweet dream, but I'm a hell of a night

[Verse 2]
No, I won't smile, but I'll show you my teeth
And I'ma let you speak if you just let me breathe
I've been polite, but won't be caught dead
Lettin' a man tell me what I should do with my bed
Keep my exes in check in my basement
'Cause kindness is weakness, or worse, you're complacent
I could play nice or I could be a bully
I'm tired and angry, but somebody should be

[Pre-Chorus]
""Come on, little lady, give us a smile""
No, I ain't got nothin' to smile about
I got no one to smile for, I waited a while for
A moment to say I don't owe you a goddamn thing
[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize

[Bridge]
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'd rather be a real nightmare, than die unaware, yeah
Someone like me can be a real nightmare, completely aware
But I'm glad to be a real nightmare, so save me your prayers

[Chorus]
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time
And I realize
I, I keep a record of the wreckage in my life
I gotta recognize the weapon in my mind
They talk shit, but I love it every time

This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot
(Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 a.m. and I'm back up poppin' with the crew

Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits

Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke

Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool

Was designed to blow my mind

Look what God gave her, how perfect He made her

I know she's got haters, but it ain't her fault, nah
Look what God gave her

We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings

Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

How many faking they streams? (A lot)

Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

We've been to both Carolinas
Seen a big Montana sky
Driven up and down a coast a few times
London, Paris, paradise
But ain't got much memory of the scenes
Come to think, I miss them all
And damn, babe, it's all your fault

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)
With my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Verse 2]
Speaking of the coast, remember Pfeiffer beach?
You and me, that sunset, cliffs by the sea
And the night rolled in
And you still talk about that moon that I can't recall
But God, I saw all I needed to
Might as well have stayed in the room
[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
With my eyes on you, yeah (With my eyes on you, with my)
Yeah, with my eyes on you (With my eyes on you, with my)

[Bridge]
Don't you remember Times Square?
And people counting down everywhere
2000-whatever, no, I didn't care
'Cause baby you were there
And once again, couldn't help but stare

[Chorus]
No matter where we go
No matter what we do
If you're there, girl, I've got my eyes on you
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you
Halfway around the world
Or the local corner booth
Yeah, you guessed it, girl
You know I got my eyes on you
We could be on any street
Any party, any room
I'll be there all night with my eyes on you
[Outro]
Don't matter where we've been
No, there ain't no better view
Than you in my arms with my eyes on you"

(Verse One)
Go on tell me what you know about me
That is what i thought
You listen to the talk
But ain’t nobody ever hear me squawk
All of y'all are quick to hate  but y'all gon’ love me when I finally meet the chalk
Watch what I make
Every thing I create
Everything that I touch
I don't need to sling no mud
I don't need a crutch
Ima let the success speak
What the fucks a grudge
Everything you've ever said about me is about to come undone
Acting like i haven't changed
Four passed and you're stuck in the past and you saying that its me to blame
Damn, i moved 500 miles away
Took my life back from the sauce
Reap what you sow and i came to close to being another corpse
Swapped the lines on a dvd case
To bind these lines in a cd case
Traded taps on these bar for these bars on tap
But my drip still finna needa a tray
Ay
Cos I'm either spitting or about to spray
I won't dance around the matter i don't do ballet
If you know me then you know i will say it to your face
Impulsive motherfucker i can't hold it in
Im about to ‘xplode again
Woo
I don't give a fuck about you
Heres front row, enjoy what i do
(Damn what a view)
God damn what a view
So glad so proud - i ain’t one of you
Ima pray straight to the clouds in the pew
The only way to let the demons out it to set the demons loose
If we all sitting ducks tell me who the fucks picking goose
I will
My days are grey
And i take it out on bae
Cos I'm para that she won't stay
Either way I'm pushing her away
When I wanna hold her close
Im so sorry but even in the best of times we don't have the dough so I don't see the need to toast
Far from a chicken but ima give you roast
Cooking up the heat tho I don't like to boast
If a woman’s place in the kitchen ima make my self at home
Kick my feet up while I'm rolling up a cone
Hit it sit back and I'm riding this
Feel this beat n its facts that I body this
Drop to my feet and ill know where nobody is
I drop a tweet everybody got burning ears
As they say if the boots fits thats the furnishing
Right this shit down you would benefit from learning this
Chose not to fuck you over like I didn't know what virgin is
Yet you painted me to be the villain come and tell me to my face what your version is
Im telling you you raped
Every avenue I paved
Everything that i gave
It was all take take take
And I know a yungen that would say the same
We the fam that you claimed
‘Cept when crunch time came
Ego set so big can't except no blame
What a joke ima have to pop another bubble you a no name
Don't take it hard man I'm the same
When its all said and done i just pray
That the life's for everyone around me will change
Have em feeling like this part weren’t a chapter it was just a page
Ay
I write what I’m living
If you don’t like it turn the shit off don’t cross my path
Right now  this is what i’m living
Snakes in the grass
I don’t need a lawnmower to get to killin’
I don’t know whether to make heads or tails i don’t know what i’m feeling
But i’m bouta paint the ceiling with the blood of every single villain
While i reel in just desserts that’s a million
I ain’t trippin’
I ain’t rippin’
Im just flowing like i never took a Ritalin
Yh i know I'm sickening
I can't help it tho
This is what I'm living"

Ain't get to hug my mama, couldn't even give her no kisses
Can't even post on my Instagram 'cause these pussy niggas be snitching
Everybody acting suspicious, might probably say that I'm tripping
When I'm all alone in my jail cell, I tend to get in my feelings
And all I smoke is that loud, don't pass me no midget
And I'ma smoke all of my pain away 'cause that's the only thing that gon' heal it
I don't understand these women who go around pretending
As if they really fuck with me, so I love 'em all from a distance

Yellow tape around his body, it's a fucking homicide
His face is on a T-shirt and his family traumatized
I didn't even mean to shoot him, he just caught me by surprise
I reloaded my pistol, cocked it back, and shot him twice
His body dropped down to the floor and he got teardrops in his eyes
He grabbed me by my hands and said he was afraid to die
I told him, ""It's too late, my friend, it's time to say goodbye""
And he died inside my arms, blood all on my shirt

Wake up in the morning, I got murder on my mind

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
I'm feelin' high like a late night summer of last year (Yeah)
Standin' there with the red dress on ya
A Killer Queen like a young Jane Fonda
Is it me or am I just havin' a good year?

[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
Dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas]
Must've done something right 'cause all these
Lights are green, man, they look like palm trees
And every time that song comes on it's about me
Oh, I feel like Post Malone when I get home
Sittin' there, winning like it's Game of Thrones
And now that we've made it, how complicated was last year?
[Chorus: Nick Jonas]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)
Sell 'em for a dollar or two (Two)
'Cause dammit, I'm feeling so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool (Cool)

[Bridge: Nick Jonas]
Woke up feelin' like a new James Dean
I comb my hair like an old school scene
When I grow up, I wanna be just like me

[Chorus: Jonas Brothers]
Lately, I've been feelin' so cool (Cool)
Top to the bottom, just cool (Cool)
Every little thing that I do (Do)
Dammit, I'm feelin' so coo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ool
It's like, ooh (Ooh), maybe I should bottle my moves (Moves)

We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise
[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4""
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6""
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind

I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb

Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

Sabes bien que fue un engaño
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado
Así mismo me engañaste
Y lloras hoy porque fallaste
Cómo tratas de buscarme
Después que tú me traicionaste
Ahora tengo que alejarme
Busqué la forma de olvidarte
(Ayy, come here, man, haha)
Ooh
(Señorita, she is beautiful, no?)
We The Best Music (Oh-nah-nah)
Sabes bien que fue un engaño (Oh-nah-nah)
Lo que me hiciste fue un pecado (Another one)

Why, oh, why? You stay, you stay
And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day, he'll grow up and be a man
And lately, you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

Look see
Everybody hatin when i'm buzzin like a satellite givin off a wave
Ta the earth for the kids
That's TV
People wanna say, they wanna fight n get the kids all hype
Like a crowd in the night
No pg
A kid a doing it right you never knew me
But i'm coming around the corner kinda dark and no
Can't see me
I tryna to be the one who's always talkin, when i think and let it out n let it go like
Free weed

[Verse]

Sorry that i gotta be the one ta flip it off
But i told you ima king, so better think twice
Of lyin on a track while comin against me
I'm fiendin to give thoughts, don't plan to be nice
So i gotta give a hundred when i'm runnin
When i'm jumpin on a mic, ima say whats in my head
I don't care about the cost, i faught for the spot that i rock
Straight raw, home grown, I don't care if you talkin
Name up in your throat like coughin
No stoppin cuz i'm sick like your mom so often
I'm back up from the ground, like the dead, In a coffin
Got a bat wit a nickname, lucy, call it
Steppin in the game like look
Callin all these Mother f****** out on the truth, then the wallet
Ill be gettin what i want In the end quit stallin
I'm ready for the fun, I've been done, gonna run this

I don't wanna hear you f****** say, 'where i'm from b****  ?'
Its all up on google n now who the dumb b****
Lookin for a reason bro, for me to get dumb rich
So never am i done doin better by minute
When i'm lifted, I be gifted, when i gimmick
Wit the image like boss
I'm fully automatic, I'm n addict in the halls
Trippin like the days i was takin adderall n i'm talkin kid days
Sorry had to do it mom
Said i had to focus everyday when i was young
Took it to level now look what i become
Kxng jay, don't play
Everyday ima in the lab wit ammunition for the punks

Still pickin around the world, tell the rats from snakes
Dumb stickin around ta see how it ends aye
Livin in Atlanta full of graves n dealin wit allizeh
A holy legend fading the hell away
I met him downtown i should have known tho
Atlanta try to play you in a sick way
Be ready for the set up you gon get played
By every mother f***** that's the broke way
Learned first hand two years wit paid slots
Don't be tryna play the artist workin harder then your pops
From the 50's n 60's respect me or not
Cuz the time within my life is all i got
I took shot. My aim is good
You better watch from the city ta hoods
I'm telling these kids, If you dream then its good n to follow that s***, when you know that you should
Jay back like a tic
I'm buggin, I'm gettin pissed
Working this really hard n nobody see how lit
It's really gonna be the minute we hit a shift
N everybody lookin be patient i'm comin big, wit the steps now
Walkin the road slow I keep cool now, ooh wow
How he spittin venom, I gettin em n never sweat it
Don't forget it, make em get it like a dube cloud
Prouder then a mother f**** spittin all the truth out

Never playing wit the 808's, I don't plan ta get away
Until the day i got to, when it come I'm gonna make way
Pirate wit the life, only tryna make the dope bay
Paddle wit the raft in the tide, ain't a joke aye
We gonna get a bottle gonna chill up in the sand
Got da brother in boat n he goin full throttle
Jay up on the finger tip, baby girls fishin
Please just hear, when you do start bloggin

Aye, lemme slow this up
Lemme say this clear, for the stupid f****
Wit a slow mind, a homie had enough
But ima say this once in case you do respond
If you wanna hear what i gotta say
Wit so many words i can do that
Its only three words, said back ta back
Its 'YOU ARE A B****', so learn to read fast
Had so many years ta learn here
But lemme be clear, you'll burn here
I'm up in the world, its my work yeh
I'm gonna get what i deserve b****
Until ima corpse in the floor near
A bag full of weed buried under a stage wit the mic in my hand
Cuz ill never change, i'm climbin this game its my turn yeh
But when i get attackin, i'm taggin, i'm gonna drag em
When they rappin, when i say its gonna happen, Its gon happen
Ain't no question on the matter, i'm handle all the hatters

And it's nothin' to do with my body

[Verso 1: Daddy Yankee]
Ella vacila y vive en la joda
No 'tá lista pa' un trajecito blanco en la boda
Puede perrear con uno, como sea, lo baila sola (Chi-chi-chi)
Batea pa' .500, siempre bota la bola (¿Cómo?)
Pon-, pónme a prueba, a ver, que to' el peso te va a caer
La orden de cateo, las mano' contra la pare'
Pa' darle pa'l piso no pide permiso (No, wuh!)

Y déjala volar como decía Tito (Hu-huh)
A ese culo el traje le queda chiquito (Ah)
La leona no está puesta pa' gatito' (No), ey
Y sin ti, le va bonito
Hoy se siente coqueta (¿Qué, qué?)
Siempre activa, nunca quieta
To'a las moña' son violeta'
El corazón lo tiene a dieta, ey
Pa' que ningún cabrón se meta (Sube, sube, sube, sube)
Te dejó en read otra ve'
Te ha picha'o to' las llamada' y to' lo' text
¿Tú no entiende' que hace rato dijo ""Next""?
La nena está haciendo más ticket que el ex, eh (¡Chin'-ching!)

[Verso 3: Lunay & Daddy Yankee]

Si no, nos vemo', mami, en el after party

This truck needs a half tank
These wheels need a two-lane

That dress needs to slip off
That hair needs to come down

What Friday nights need to do
That's the truth

Yeah, birds need bees and ice needs whiskey

Shades need drawin', hearts need fallin'
Boots need knockin', knockin' boots
Knockin' boots, me and you, oh

Long weeks need a weekend
Cheap drinks need a-slingin'
That dance floor needs some me on you
And you on me tonight
Singalongs need to be sung
Tip bells need to be rung
Last calls need a call that cab
And backseats need I want you so bad

I'm gonna be my own best"
975,2019,Eric Church,Some Of It,"[Verse 1]
Beer don't keep
Love’s not cheap
And trucks don't wreck themselves
Mama ain't a shrink
Daddy ain't a bank
And God ain't a wishin' well
Money ain't rich
Everybody sins
And nobody wins in a fight
And sometimes wrong is right

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Verse 2]
Girls like to laugh
Tears don't last
And scared's what praying's for
If it's close, swing the bat
Everybody's got a past
And love's worth living for
When you dance, hold her close
'Til it breaks, go for broke
Be the first to reach for her hand
No, you don't get to do some things again
[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it

[Bridge]
When you can take it slow
'Cause time sure won't
What really makes you a man
Is being true to her 'til your glass runs out of sand

[Chorus]
Some of it you learn the hard way
Some of it you read on a page
Some of it comes from heartbreak
Most of it comes with age
And none of it ever comes easy
A bunch of it you maybe can't use
I know I don't probably know what I think I do
But there's something to some of it
Some of it"

But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)
They'd rather see me down, put my soul in the fire
But we keep goin' higher, higher

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, look
My granny 88, she had my uncle and then
A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end
Pops turned 60, he proud what we done
In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog
Mani turned ten, Kross turned two
Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool
In this rap shit ten, never made nerd moves

[Chorus: John Legend]
Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)
(Hussle, Khaled)
But don't you know that the devil is a liar? (Yeah, I know)

Fuck niggas always gotta learn the hard way
We gon' tape it off if we ball play
Put a half a moon crescent on your bald fade
Police hit the lights, that's a car chase
Lookin' back at my life make my heart race
Dance with the devil and test our faith
I was thinkin' chess moves but it was God's grace
Crooked ass whoever 'til we all straight
With no shame, I peeped game and it's all fake
South Central state of mind, high crime rate (Yeah)
Homicide, hate, gang banging'll get you all day (Yeah, yeah)
And look at my fate

Oh, you keep taking me higher and higher (Yeah)

[Chorus: Roddy Ricch]
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check (Mhmmhm)
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck (Mhmmhm)
Tryna put the water on my Patek (Mhmmhm)
I got killers to the left of me (Mhmmhm)

We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild

Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, ""Nigga, live your life and grow""
I'd tell you, ""Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke""

Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck

All the boats I've missed
All the hell I've caused
All the lips I've kissed
All the love I've lost
I got kicked around
I've been black and blue
On my way to you

[Verse 2]
All the stars I've seen
All the songs I've sung
All the beers I've drank
All the damage done
I was just passin' time
Kinda just passin' through
On my way to you

Every curve, every ditch
Every turn, every bridge

Every fork in the road
It was all worth the while
When I finally saw your smile
Every highway, every heartbreak
Every mountain, every mile

I got the radio up
Sun is going down
I’ll take a left at the bank
And I’ll head straight through town
So baby, put on that dress
A little sweet perfume
‘Cause I’m on my way to you

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)
Now I'm digging up a grave from my past

It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Worse)

I'm a whole different person (Person)
It's a gift and a curse (Curse)
But I cannot reverse it

You gave me the runaround
I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you
You, you, you
[Chorus]
She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (No hurt)
Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (I'm making it worse)

[Intro]
Maluma, baby

[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio
Quiere salir a joder, yeh-yeah
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

[Verso]
Le rompiero' el corazón y no busca a nadie que se lo reponga
Solo quiere a alguien que se lo ponga
Ella quiere un man que no la llame y que no joda
Pa' reemplazar al perro que no la valora
Quiere aprovechar que está más buena y más de moda
Empezó a meterle al gym desde que quedó sola
Las envidiosas dicen que eso se lo hizo el cirujano
Pero es ella misma queriendo salir del daño

[Pre-Coro]
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor
[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio (No busca novio, no)
Quiere salir a joder (Yeh-yeah)
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo (Ey, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

[Refrán]
Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare
No quiere un novio pa' rendirle cuentas
No necesita ningún HP en el party que la pare
Y cuando se suelta
No existe una amiguita que la pare
No quiere un novio pa' rendirle cuentas
No necesita ningún HP en el party que la pare

[Pre-Coro]
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor
Quiere salir, fumar, beber
Subir un video pa' que lo vea él
Pa' que se de cuenta de lo que perdió
Pa' que el hijuepu— se sienta peor (Peor)
[Coro]
Ella no está buscando novio (No busca novio, no)
Quiere salir a joder (Yeh-yeah)
Quiere olvidarse de ese bobo (Ey, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
Porque el cabrón le fue infiel, oh-no-no-no

[Outro]
Ella no está buscando novio (No busca novio, no)
Quiere salir a joder, yeh-yeah, yeh-yeah
Para olvidarte de ese bobo
Cuenta conmigo, mujer, yeh-yeah, yeh-yeah"
996,2019,Jason Aldean,Rearview Town,"[Verse 1]
Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I'm outta here
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that ""ya'll come back"" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Verse 2]
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new
[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Bridge]
It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say

[Chorus]
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
Population minus me
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

[Outro]
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town"

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hands on your body, I'm grabbin' your ass
Enjoyin' the moment 'cause life move too fast
I'm lookin' forward, ignorin' the past
These are the times that we'll laugh lookin' back
I'm gettin' lucky like coins in the well
Goodbye to my haters, I'm wishin' you well
This is my year, man, if you couldn't tell

Late nights in the city, causin' hell
Burn this bitch into the ground, oh well
If all we got tonight, let's do this right
Let's do this right

Let's go to (Paradise)
This shit feel like Friday nights
This shit make me feel alive
I feel like we in paradise, paradise (Paradise)

Insecure people turn to insecure lovers

999,2019,Jhene Aiko,Triggered,"[Verse 1]
Go figure
You were the trigger
You brought me to an obstructed view
When you knew the picture was bigger
Who am I kiddin'?
Knew from the beginning
You'd ruin everything, you do it every time
You are my enemy, you are no friend of mine, muhfucker

[Chorus]
You muhfuckin' right
You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I...

[Verse 2]
Wanna fuck you right now
I just turned the lights out now
And you know when the sun go down
That's when it would all go down
Been a minute, been a while
Ain't let nobody hit it since you hit it
I know you always know what to do wit' it
But ain't no me and you without you in it
Damn, I'm 'bout to burn this bitch down
I think I need to lie down
'Cause I'm not tryna wild out now
But right now
[Verse 3]
Don't know what I'm capable of
Might fuck around and go crazy on cuz
Might fuck around, have to pay me in blood
This ain't the way that you want it
Might catch a case in this bitch
Don't let me catch you face-to-face in this bitch
Tryin' my hardest not to disrespect you
After what you did, man, what you expected?
You muhfucker

[Chorus]
You muhfuckin' right
You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I...

Tryna let the time fly (Yeah)
Tryna let the time go by
Tryna let the time heal all
Tryna let the time kill all
Of our memories
All you meant to me
All that history
All that's history
I'll calm down eventually
Fall back eventually, please
Call me back eventually
Fall back into me, yeah
Maybe I'm overreacting
Baby, I don't know what happened
You know all of my bad habits
You know it's hard for me to control that shit, man
'Cause when I get mad, I get big mad
Should have never did that, get back
'Bout to feel the wrath of a menace
In my bag, in my feelings
I'm a bad lil' bitch, and uh...
[Outro]
I'm triggered, when I see your face
Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay, uh
You need to stay out my way

Triggered, when I hear your name
Triggered, I am not okay (Yeah)
You need to stay out of my way
You need to stay out of my way (Yeah)
