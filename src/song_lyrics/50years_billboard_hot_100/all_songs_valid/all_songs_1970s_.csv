How I depend on you
To give me love when I need it

And the moon and the stars
Were the gifts you gave
To the dark, and the endless skies

Like the trembling heart
Of a captive bird
That was there, at my command

I felt your heart so close to mine
And I knew our joy
Would fill the earth
And last, 'til the end of time

7,1972,Cat Stevens,Morning Has Broken,"Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word

Sweet the rain's new fall, sunlit from Heaven
Like the first dew fall on the first grass
Praise for the sweetness of the wet garden
Sprung in completeness where His feet pass

Mine is the sunlight, mine is the morning
Born of the One Light Eden saw play
Praise with elation, praise every morning
God's recreation of the new day

Morning has broken like the first morning
Blackbird has spoken like the first bird
Praise for the singing, praise for the morning
Praise for them springing fresh from the Word"

Washed away the darkness of the lonely night (Lonely night)

Oh, and last night, I got to thinking maybe I, I, I
Should call you up and just forget my foolish pride
I heard your number ringing, I went cold inside

God knows this heart of mine could use a rest
But more and more I find the dreams I left behind

Women think I'm tasty, but they're always tryin' to waste me

11,1972,Carpenters,It's Going To Take Some Time,"It's going to take some time this time
To get myself in shape
I really fell out of line this time
I really missed the gate

The birds on the telephone line (next time)
Are crying out to me (next time)
And I won't be so blind next time
And I'll find some harmony

But it's going to take some time this time
And I can't make demands
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends?
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time

It's going to take some time this time
No matter what I've planned
But like the young trees in the wintertime
I'll learn how to bend

After all the tears we've spent
How could we make amends?
So it's one more round for experience
And I'm on the road again
And it's going to take some time this time"
12,1972,The Jimmy Castor Bunch,Troglodyte (Cave Man),"What we're gonna do right here is go back, way back, back into time
When the only people that existed were troglodytes... cave men...
Cave women... Neanderthal... troglodytes. Let's take the average
Cave man at home, listening to his stereo. Sometimes he'd get up
Try to do his thing. He'd begin to move, something like this:
""Dance... dance"". When he got tired of dancing alone, he'd look
In the mirror: ""Gotta find a woman gotta find a woman gotta find a
Woman gotta find a woman"". He'd go down to the lake where all the
Woman would be swimming or washing clothes or something. He'd look
Around and just reach in and grab one. ""Come here... come here""
He'd grab her by the hair. You can't do that today, fellas, cause
It might come off. You'd have a piece of hair in your hand and she'd
Be swimming away from you (ha-ha). This one woman just lay there
Wet and frightened. He said: ""Move... move"". She got up. She was a
Big woman. BIG woman. Her name was Bertha. Bertha Butt. She was one
Of the Butt sisters. He didn't care. He looked up at her and said:
""Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me
Sock it to me sock it to me sock it to me!"". She looked down on him
She was ready to crush him, but she began to like him. She said
(Falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". He said: ""Wha?"". She said (falsetto):
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"". You know what he said? He started it way
Back then. I wouldn't lie to you. When she said (falsetto)
""I'll sock it to ya, Daddy"" he said ""Right on! Right on! Hotpants!
Hotpants! Ugh... ugh... ugh"""

14,1972,Bread,Diary,"I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words she'd written
Took me by surprise
You'd never read them in her eyes

They said that she had found
The love she'd waited for
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

Then she confronted
With the writing there
Simply pretended not to care
I passed it off
As just in keeping
With her total disconcerting air

And though she tried
To hide the love that she denied
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will give to her, my wife
All the sweet things I can find

I found her diary underneath a tree
And started reading about me
The words began to stick, and tears to flow
Her meaning now was clear to see

The love she'd waited for
Was someone else, not me
Wouldn't you know it?
She wouldn't show it

And as I go through my life
I will wish for her, his wife
All the sweet things she can find
All the sweet things they can find"

It was late last night

There was not another soul in sight
Only you, only you

So we walked along
Though I knew that there was something wrong
And a feeling hit me, oh so strong
About you

Then you gazed up at me
And the answer was plain to see
'Cause I saw the light
In your eyes (in your eyes)
In your eyes (in your eyes)

Though we had our fling (we had our fling)
I just never would suspect a thing (suspect a thing)

Were just something I never knew
'Til I saw the light

But I love you best
It's not something that I say in jest

17,1972,Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen,Hot Rod Lincoln,"My pappy said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot Rod Lincoln.""

Have you heard this story of the Hot Rod race
When Fords and Lincolns was settin' the pace
That story is true, I'm here to say
I was drivin' that Model A

It's got a Lincoln motor and it's really souped up
That Model A body makes it look like a pup
It's got eight cylinders; uses them all
It's got overdrive, just won't stall

With a 4-barrel carb and a dual exhaust
With 4.11 gears you can really get lost
It's got safety tubes, but I ain't scared
The brakes are good, tires fair

Pulled out of San Pedro late one night
The moon and the stars was shinin' bright
We was drivin' up Grapevine Hill
Passing cars like they was standing still

All of a sudden in a wink of an eye
A Cadillac sedan passed us by
I said, ""Boys, that's a mark for me!""
By then the taillight was all you could see

Now the fellas was ribbin' me for bein' behind
So I thought I'd make the Lincoln unwind
Took my foot off the gas and man alive
I shoved it on down into overdrive

Wound it up to a hundred-and-ten
My speedometer said that I hit top end
My foot was glued like lead to the floor
That's all there is and there ain't no more

Now the boys all thought I'd lost my sense
And telephone poles looked like a picket fence
They said, ""Slow down! I see spots!
The lines on the road just look like dots.""

Took a corner; sideswiped a truck
Crossed my fingers just for luck
My fenders was clickin' the guardrail posts
The guy beside me was white as a ghost

Smoke was comin' from out of the back
When I started to gain on that Cadillac
Knew I could catch him, I thought I could pass
Don't you know by then we'd be low on gas?

We had flames comin' from out of the side
Feel the tension. Man! What a ride!
I said, ""Look out, boys, I've got a license to fly!""
And that Caddy pulled over and let us by

Now all of a sudden she started to knockin'
And down in the dips she started to rockin'
I looked in my mirror; a red light was blinkin'
The cops was after my Hot Rod Lincoln!

They arrested me and they put me in jail
And called my pappy to throw my bail
And he said, ""Son, you're gonna' drive me to drinkin'
If you don't stop drivin' that Hot... Rod... Lincoln!"""

22,1972,Elton John,Rocket Man,"[Verse 1: Prodigy]
These niggas know the deal, it's easy to get killed
Wet that pussy up, see now you got the chills
Your bright idea shooting at me, the fuck yeah
Bright idea, 'til I blew out his light bulb
I'm more than a hip hop legend, I'm iconic
My sixteen is strong as fuck, I'm bionic
Apparently...you a parody of real nigga shit
Pop your forehead like a zit
I don't fuck with no snitches so I need to know who telling
And I need to know who they told on so I can fact check it
The alpha and omega, Mobb nigga I'm a fixture
Black culture, bougie niggas get they bitch took
Like bad bitches get they body shook
From Jamaica Ave. to the boulevard in Hollywood
From the projects, Nam and Oslo
Rocketman Elton John, call me P-iano

[Hook: Prodigy]
Yeah now I'm on my shit, got me on my shit
I'll hit a nigga with the clipper
And fade a nigga real quick, see
Keep me on my shit, wiling on that shit
I will ruin your life, I promise you that shit

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
Swedish features through the window of a Lincoln on the Bell swerving
I felt certain I was born to be the best Earthling
Felt worthless, so many Xs and circles
On my mother neck I know I serve a purpose
Smoke the same shit that turns a normal turtle to a ninja turtle
Neo-ninja doing ? on Myrtle
The motherfucker making a drug look like Urkel
Foreign shooters like Türkoğlu
740 with the curtain and set to 1020 degrees
Eyes closed switching speeds, hitting the weave
I shapeshift to a disease, attack your lung and cripple your knees
R&b chicks are twisted with ease, blitzkrieg
You still posing for your little-league pictures
I'm drinking beer straight out the pitcher
I'll put your moms in an armbar at the bar-mitzvah
Irish linen on the king
I'm guaranteed I'm gonna win another ring

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
I supercede that crap, now bitches want this hard shit
Niggas want this crack, them songs you got that's garbage
Paralyze your ears, stop talking, this P rapping
Been doing this for years, know money I keep racking, up
Come with it nigga, get beat the fuck, up
Next to me you're chuck meat
Yeah, we just committed suicide
With this swammi I get busy B; do or die
Big bar champion, the Henny and the rap flow
The great black shark, you just a little mackeral
My bitch appetite for power surpass yours
Now imagine my thoughts while I'm alone and you paused
That's 600 horses stomping on your neck strap
That's me, g-leaning with the pistol on my lap
Got a 3:00 your death, I could pencil you in
Ya'll niggas is chow, my gun fit to dig in

23,1972,Harry Chapin,Taxi,"It was raining hard in 'Frisco
I needed one more fare to make my night
A lady up ahead waved to flag me down
She got in at the light

Oh, where you going to, my lady blue
It's a shame you ruined your gown in the rain
She just looked out the window, and said
""Sixteen Parkside Lane""

Something about her was familiar
I could swear I'd seen her face before
But she said, ""I'm sure you're mistaken""
And she didn't say anything more

It took a while, but she looked in the mirror
And she glanced at the license for my name
A smile seemed to come to her slowly
It was a sad smile, just the same
And she said, ""How are you Harry?""
I said, ""How are you Sue?
Through the too many miles
And the too little smiles
I still remember you.""

It was somewhere in a fairy tale
I used to take her home in my car
We learned about love in the back of the Dodge
The lesson hadn't gone too far
You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off to find the sky

Oh, I've got something inside me
To drive a princess blind
There's a wild man, wizard
He's hiding in me, illuminating my mind
Oh, I've got something inside me
Not what my life's about
Cause I've been letting my outside tide me
Over 'till my time, runs out

Baby's so high that she's skying
Yes she's flying, afraid to fall
I'll tell you why baby's crying
Cause she's dying, aren't we all

There was not much more for us to talk about
Whatever we had once was gone
So I turned my cab into the driveway
Past the gate and the fine trimmed lawns
And she said we must get together
But I knew it'd never be arranged
And she handed me twenty dollars
For a two fifty fare, she said
""Harry, keep the change.""
Well another man might have been angry
And another man might have been hurt
But another man never would have let her go...
I stashed the bill in my shirt

And she walked away in silence
It's strange, how you never know
But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for
Such a long, long time ago

You see, she was gonna be an actress
And I was gonna learn to fly
She took off to find the footlights
And I took off for the sky
And here, she's acting happy
Inside her handsome home
And me, I'm flying in my taxi
Taking tips, and getting stoned
I go flying so high, when I'm stoned"
24,1972,Creedence Clearwater Revival,Someday Never Comes,"[Verse 1]
First thing I remember
Was asking papa ""Why?""
For there were many things I didn't know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And Daddy always smiled
Took me by the hand
Saying, ""Someday
You'll understand""

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes

[Verse 2]
The time and tears went by
And I collected dust
For there were many things
I didn't know

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When Daddy went away
He said, ""Try to be a man
And, Someday you'll understand""

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes

[Verse 3]
And then, one day in April
I wasn't even there
For there were many things I didn't know

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A son was born to me
Mama held his hand
Saying ""Someday you'll understand""

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Ooh, someday never comes

[Verse 4]
Think it was September
The year I went away
For there were many things
I didn't know

[Pre-Chorus 4]
And I still see him standin
Tryin' to be a man
I said, ""Someday
You'll understand""

[Chorus]
Well, I'm here to tell you now, each and every mother's son
You'd better learn it fast
You'd better learn it young
'Cause Someday Never Comes
Ooh someday never comes

26,1972,Millie Jackson,Ask Me What You Want,"Come to me before your friends tell you
They can't help you
I'm your woman I should be the first one to know
If you want something
If you need something
Why do you think I work so hard
And do all the things I do
Because I don't want nobody else to do a thing for you

Baby, baby please ask me what you want
And I'll try my best to get it, get it, get it, get it
Ask me what you want
And I'll try my best to get it, get it, get it, get it

You've shown me that a woman's place
Is right beside her man
This I can understand
That foolish pride keeps pushing aside
All the things I wanna do for you
I'm on your side
Don't you know that when you're down
I'm the one you should turn to

Don't be ashamed because it's the same
Thing I expect of you
Baby, baby please
Why should my giving you things make you feel insecure
I'm also giving you all the love anyone can endure"

A turn of the page
Can read like before
Can we ask for more?
Each day passes by
How hard man will try?
The sea will not wait
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry -

Wished I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wished I could be in your eyes
Looking back there you were, and here we are

Isn't love strange
A word we arrange
With no thought or care
Maker of despair
Each breath that we breathe
With love we must weave
To make us as one
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry -

Wished I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wished I could be in your eyes
Looking back there you were, and here we are

Isn't life strange
A turn of the page
A book without light
Unless with love we write;
To throw it away
To lose just a day
The quicksand of time
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry -

Wished I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wished I could be in your eyes
Looking back there you were

Wished I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wished I could be in your eyes
Looking back there you were

Wished I could be in your heart
To be one with your love
Wished I could be in your eyes
Looking back there you were..."

I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention""

Old man, look at my life
Twenty-four, and there's so much more
Live alone in a paradise
That makes me think of two
Love lost, such a cost
Give me things that don't get lost
Like a coin that won't get tossed
Rolling home to you

I'm a lot like you
I need someone to love me
The whole day through
Ah, one look in my eyes
And you can tell that's true

Lullabies, look in your eyes
Run around the same old town
Doesn't mean that much to me
To mean that much to you
I've been first and last
Look at how the time goes past
But I'm all alone at last
Rolling home to you

Just a sad, sad story

Living in a house divided
With a love that's so one-sided
There's no chance at all
The walls have gotta fall
Living in a house divided
With a love that's so one-sided
There's no chance at all
The walls have gotta fall
Tumbling down

Look at us, the King and Queen of emptiness
Living inside our castle of linliness
Unable to make amends
Such perfect strangers are we
Is this how it will end?
Just a sad story

Living in a house divided
With a love that's so one-sided

Living in a house divided
With a love that's so one-sided
There's no chance at all
The walls have gotta fall

Daddy, slow down some 'cause you're makin' me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

46,1972,Stevie Wonder,Superwoman (Where Were You When I Needed You),"[Verse 1]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head?
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is
Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind?
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, and I think I can be very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head

[Verse 2]
Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream?
My woman wants to be a superwoman
And I just had to say goodbye
Because I can't spend all my hours starting to cry

[Chorus]
But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me, too, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head
Very well, think that I know you very well
Wish you knew me like I know you, very well
But I think I can deal with everything going through your head
(Your filthy head)

Very well, dum dum da, dum dum da
Very well, wish you knew me too very well
And I wish I could think of everything going through your head

And I think I can deal with everything going through your head

[Verse 3]
When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
When the winter came, you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past
When the winter came, you were not around
Through the bitter winds, love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
Oh, I need you, baby; I need you, baby

Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past, oh
Spring will fill the air, you will come around
Is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love?
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now

Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear?
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby
I need you, baby; I need you, baby; I need you, baby

47,1972,Luther Ingram,(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want To Be Right,"If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you
I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy say it's a shame
It's a downright disgrace
Long as I got you by my side
I don't care what your people say
Your friends tell you it's no future
In loving a married man
If I can't see you when I want to
I'll see you when I can

If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children
Depending on me too
And am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got somebody else at home
Who needs me just as much
And are you wrong to fall in love
With a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right

*sick horn break down*

Are you wrong to give your love
To a married man
And am I wrong trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong I don't wanna be right

I don't wanna be right
If it means being without you
I don't wanna be right
If it means sleeping at night
I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong"

We sat on a wall of security so high above
With his arms all around me
It was like a fairy tale
Two people so in love
Tell me how could it fail

The walls started shakin' her love right out
Happiness is given away, security is fallin' down
He fell, I fell, all there is left to tell

Conquistador your stallion stands
In need of company
And like some angel's haloed brow
You reek of purity
I see your armour-plated breast
Has long since lost its sheen
And in your death mask face
There are no signs which can be seen

Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

[Verse 2]
Conquistador a vulture sits
Upon your silver shield
And in your rusty scabbard now
The sand has taken seed
And though your jewel-encrusted blade
Has not been plundered still
The sea has washed across your face
And taken of its fill

[Chorus]
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Conquistador there is no time
I must pay my respect
And though I came to jeer at you
I leave now with regret
And as the gloom begins to fall
I see there is no aureole
And though you came with sword held high
You did not conquer, only die

[Chorus]
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind
Though I hoped for something to find
I could see no maze to unwind

It was the third of September
That day I'll always remember, yes I will
'Cause that was the day that my daddy died
Papa died when we was very young
I never got a chance to see him
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
Mama looked up and said, son

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone

[Verse 2]
Hey, mama, is it true what they say
That Papa never worked a day in his life?
And mama, there's some bad talk goin' around town
Sayin' that papa had three outside children and another wife
And that ain't right
Hey, heard some talk about papa doing some storefront preaching
Talking 'bout saving souls and all the time leeching
Dealing in debt and stealing in the name of the Lord
Mama just looked up and

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone

[Verse 3]
Mama, mama, mama
I heard papa called himself a jack of all trades
Tell me is that what sent papa to an early grave?
Folks say papa would beg, borrow or steal to pay his bills
I wanna know, mama
Folks say papa never was much on thinkin'
Spent most of his time chasin' women and drinkin'
Mama, I'm depending on you to tell me the truth
With tear-filled eyes, mama [?] say

[Chorus]
Papa was a rolling stone, son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone, very alone
Papa was a rolling stone, my son
Wherever he laid his hat was his home
And when he died
All he left us was alone, very alone"

Finest thing you ever seen

Do you love me and make me cry?
How I love her, she's all that I want
How I need her, she's all that I need

I'd throw her back in the Penitentiary, now
And if I caught her with my mother's son

How you could be anything but beautiful

And you were made for me

And I know that I won't ever change

Through rain or shine

It seems so lucky just to have the right
Of telling you with all my might
You're beautiful tonight

And I know that you will never stray
'Cause you've been that way
From day to day
For such a long, long time

And when you hold me tight
How could life be anything but beautiful

To be the one who's telling you
I'm telling you
That you're beautiful"

81,1972,Tom Jones,The Young New Mexican Puppeteer,"In a town near Albuquerque
Lived a most concerned young boy
He said lately I have noticed
Folks don't live with peace and joy

With frowns and worry on their faces
They're lost and don't know where to go
He said I'll get the people straightened
By putting on a puppet show

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

First he carved out young Abe Lincoln
Abe will teach 'em civil rights
Then a King named Martin Luther
So they'd recall his peaceful fight

Old Mark Twain, his wit and wisdom
Will surely show them life is fun
But he smiled with satisfaction
When the Prince of Peace was done

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they'd listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

Now his puppet shows were clever
And he made the people laugh
When he got across the message
To walk along life's open path

They built him his own puppet theatre
Decked out with spotlights yellow and red
And then they wrote him up in all the papers
And this is what the story said

It said...

The young New Mexican puppeteer
He saw the people all lived in fear
He thought that maybe they would listen to
A puppet telling them what to do

You know he got some string and he got some wood
He did some carving and he was good
And folks came running so they could hear
The young New Mexican puppeteer

Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand - yes I am

[Verse 1]
In the days between the hours
Ivory towers, bloody flowers
Push their heads into the air
I don't care if I ever know - there I go

Don't push your love too far
Your wounds won't leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream

[Verse 2]
Did someone bow their head?
Did someone break the bread?
Good people are in bed
Before nine o'clock

On the pad before my eyes
Paper cries, tellin' lies
The promises you gave
From the grave of a broken heart, hmm

[Chorus]

I sit here in my lonely room
Don't push your love too far
You know your wounds won't even leave a scar
Right now is where you are
In a broken dream
And don't you forget what I say - hoo, hoo
Ivory towers, bloody flowers..."

Now I go and tear the mall up I do this often
And I take of my momma this shit is awesome
And until I'm in my coffin imma keep ballin

Hustle to hustle way I'm in the game like soccеr cleats
Ain't nobody stoppin me fuck a lot cause I got thе key
Crack it wide open for my people bitch we got to eat
My baby boy I got to feed a better way there's got to be
Million in my bank account before I die I gotta see
Trynna fulfill my prophecy they laughed now the copy me
Only God on top of me

Step in my shoes you gon' understand my vision
Conditions of my livin we wasn't supposed to be winnin'
Told us shut up and listen 'cause they seen that we're different
Right then and there we made a decision and built a business
Everything independent Four Fifty-Four on my pendant
We did it right it's what they don't like They feel resentment
If it ain't directed it ain't respected I quickly debt it
By any means I'm gon' get it
My nigga look at where we come from
Got it out the mud with my loved ones
Run it up we gon' need it all you don't want none
Gotta bring it right back to the neighborhood I sprung from
Represent correct with every breath until my lungs done
Started out with nothing now we run our own company
Hundred dollar shows now we need a couple G's
Four round trip flights with a couple keys
We gon' pull up give the people what they wanna see

Quality sell itself take it or leave it
But I ain't budgin' bitch you buggin'
They don't make 'em this decent
If you owe me you can pay it in pieces
Just hope it reaches gotta reason
Just need some time to illustrate my thesis
Fuck the preachin' I just want the lights and the action
Don't compare me to these niggas I got twice the passion
Long nights in traffic not a second in vain
Take the good with the bad and I respect them the same
Lace the wood up with hash all I smoke is supreme
If it ain't Ninety-One or better then don't roll up a thing uh
Dope paragraphs doper than a pair of halves
Check your grip this shit so heavy most won't dare to grasp
The other half to scared to gas and just don't bear a chance
Pair of bands in every pair of pants
Go and get it or regret it can't go back and re-edit
Built an understandin' No more lookin' back 'cause we get it

Cause such heartache (yes, he will)
That a woman feels she only take
He'll make all kind of mistakes
(Yes, he will) that cause your
Heart to break

Seems like every day
Is like the one before
The things you used to say
You don't say anymore

Bits and pieces of your time
Are all you can afford
It looks like you just can't see
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Bed, bed, bed, bed and board

Lying half awake
I hear you switch the light
You turn off the late news
Oh, I'm in luck tonight

Three times a week is my reward
Well, you can't seem to understand
That there's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)

(Bed and board) oh, don't you know

Don't know what happened
But you've changed somehow
And like a puppet
On a string, baby, oh

You're only going
Through the motions now
You touch me but you don't
Feel anything, anything

You're gonna say
That it's all in my mind
Lord knows how I've thought it out
At least a thousand times

I've got to try again
I need my faith in life restored
I can't wait any longer 'cause
There's much more to love

Than bed and board (bed and board)
Baby, bed, bed, bed and board
(Bed and board) so right there
You oughta listen cause what else

So much more to life
Than just a bed and a roof
Saying, I believe
I believe that a man
Will misuse a woman
If he's given the chance

And I believe
That he will abuse a woman
At the beginning of a romance

'Cause all they ever want is bed (bed)
Your bed (bed) my bed (bed) his bed
It don't make any difference where it is

See, but I don't find anything wrong
With making a little love
On an early Sunday morning
You oughta be in church (amen)

Ain't nothing wrong (amen)
With a little love on an early
Monday morning, Monday morning
(Monday morning)

When your baby's supposed
To be going to work
He can't leave you, no, no, no
He can't leave your side
And here's why

Because a man needs love
And a man needs to be hugged
And kissed, yes, he does

You know it's something when
We ladies start to prepare
Ourselves for that particular man
Waiting for him to come home
So he can just hold our hand

You know, I believe that all of
That all you do something like this
You might run the water
Putting all of those nice things
Into that tub

And when we're finished
We have all kinds of sweet
Smelling things that we put on
Perfumes and some of us decide to
Just powder ourselves all the way down
That's good because that's what they like

And when he comes through the door
And you're lying there in your negligee
Or whatever it might be

And he says to you
I'm too tired, I'm too tired
And you turn to him and say
Do you think I did all this for me

You can still hear that same moan from him
I'm too tired, I've been working all day
But you don't wanna hear that, do you

You see, because the art of making love
Has to be done in a certain way
And it can only been done when
Two people become totally involved

But sometimes a man
Just out of forgetfulness
Will not remember a woman's birthday
And it's not intentional
It's just because it's the way they're made

And they'll forget to call you
Exactly on the hour because
They forget that little things
Mean a lot

'Cause there's so much more to life
Than bed and board"

There can't be a medicated lotion
That can sooth, no no, my emotion

Well I don't need no doctor, because my will to live is gone
(I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor)
All I need is my baby
Baby please won't you come on home
Won't you come on home

I don't need no doctor, because I know what's ailing me
(I don't need no doctor, I don't need no doctor)
I've been too long away from my baby

Coming down with misery

115,1973,Skylark,Wildflower,"She's faced the hardest times you could imagine
And many times her eyes fought back the tears
And when her youthful world was about to fall in
Each time her slender shoulders bore the weight of all her fears
And a sorrow no one hears still rings in midnight silence in her ears

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

And if by chance I should hold her
Let me hold her for a time
But if allowed just one possession
I would pick her from the garden to be mine

Be careful how you touch her, for she'll awaken
And sleep's the only freedom that she knows
And when you walk into her eyes, you won't believe
The way she's always paying for a debt she never owes
And a silent wind still blows that only she can hear
And so she goes

Let her cry for she's a lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

Let her cry for she's lady
Let her dream for she's a child
Let the rain fall down upon her
She's a free and gentle flower growing wild

She's a flower growing wild
She's free"

122,1973,Vicki Lawrence,The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia,"He was on his way home from Candletop
Been two weeks gone and he'd thought he'd stop at Webb's
And have him a drink before he went home to her

Andy Wolloe said hello
And he said, ""Hi, what's doing, Wo?""
Said, ""Sit down, I got some bad news, it's gonna hurt.""

He said, ""I'm your best friend and you know that's right
But your young bride ain't home tonight
Since you been gone, she's been seeing that Amos boy, Seth.""

Well, he got mad and he saw red
And Andy said, ""Boy, don't you lose your head
Cause to tell you the truth, I've been with her myself.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, Andy got scared and left the bar
Walking on home, cause he didn't live far
See, Andy didn't have many friends
And he just lost him one

Brother thought his wife musta left town
So he went home and finally found
The only thing Papa had left him and that was a gun

Then he went off to Andy's house
Slippin' through the backwoods, quiet as a mouse
Came upon some tracks too small for Andy to make
He looked through the screen at the back porch door
And he saw Andy lying on the floor
In a puddle of blood and he started to shake

Well, the Georgia patrol was making their rounds
So he fired a shot just to flag them down
And a big-bellied sheriff grabbed his gun
And said ""Why'd you do it?""

Well, the judge said guilty in a make-believe trial
Slapped the sheriff on the back with a smile
Said, ""Supper's waitin' at home and I gotta get to it.""

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia
That's the night that they hung an innocent man
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Well, they hung my brother before I could say
The tracks he saw while on his way
To Andy's house and back that night were mine
And his cheating wife had never left town
And that's one body that'll never be found
See, little sister don't miss when she aims her gun

That's the night that the lights went out in Georgia, whoa-oh
That's the night that they hung an innocent man, uh-huh
Well, don't trust your soul to no backwoods, southern lawyer
Cause the judge in the town's got bloodstains on his hands

Oh, that's the night that the lights went out in Georgia"
123,1973,The Sweet,Little Willy,"There's a yellow rose in Texas that I am gonna see
Nobody else could miss her, not half as much as me
She cried so when I left her, it like to broke my heart
And if I ever find her we never more will part
She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me
Where the Rio Grande is flowin', and starry skies are bright
She walks along the river in the quiets of her night
I know that she remembers when we parted long ago
I promised to return and not to leave her so
She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me
Oh, now I'm gonna find her, for my heart is full of woe
We'll do the things together we did so long ago
We'll play the banjo gaily, she'll love me like before
And the yellow rose of Texas shall be mine forevermore
She's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew
Her eyes are bright as diamonds, they sparkle like the dew
You may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosa Lee
But the yellow rose of Texas is the only girl for me"

Nothin' anyone can say
You're with me now and as long as you stay

Lovin' you's the right thing

I know you've had some bad luck with ladies before
They drove you or you drove them crazy
But more important is I know you're the one and I'm sure
Lovin' you's the right thing to do
Lovin' you's the right thing

And it used to be for a while
That the river flowed right to my door
Making me just a little too free
But now the river doesn't seem to stop here anymore

Hold me in your hands like a bunch of flowers
Set me movin' to your sweetest song
And I know what I think I've known all along
Lovin' you's the right thing to do
Lovin' you's the right thing
Lovin' you's the right thing to do
Is the right thing

Nothing you could ever do would turn me away from you
I love you now and I love you now
Even though you're ten thousand miles away
I'll love you tomorrow as I love you today

I'm in love with you babe"

'Bout messin' with the wife of a jealous man

With a couple of pieces gone

So I call on Krizz, Rittz and Prozak, let's go!

(Haha, here we go again! Yeah! Hey Tech, watch this!)
Kali baby, I guess I'm back at it again
Lemme laugh at 'em again
'Cause they know I write the back out of a pen
Holy moly get going nobody hold 'em is what they told 'em
And poda-be motor yodeling sick and ain't gettin over it
Sick at the lip and watch 'em clown, watch 'em clown, clown
Loving to tickle 'em I be licking 'em down, give 'em the crown
Look at the ground when you approaching the regal Beagle
And people don't be equal and what they saying is fecal
Betta give it up, put 'em in the blender
Surrender it like you had enough
Never no-contender pretending like you ready-to-buck
Ninja turtle talkin' to a splinter, I don't give a fuck
Ah-ha, it goes up
Killin' niggas like they coppers
And rappers on my thing-a-ma-bobber
Come to chopping I'm the home of the whopper
Your girly bopping I don't think I can stop her
So dope that it made her wanna gimme a slobber
They remember you when you stop and you pop
Every syllable, bow down to a nigga that's bigger than you
And he thinking he can come and speak at him really rude
Ah-ha, eat the nigga food
I'll knock the stuffing out ya muffin, fucking knucklehead
Never did it wrong 'cause you singing the song all in your head
Lead off, I beat the beat up and go
Run a nigga feet off and chew him like a piece of pilaf
Shitting on niggas an leave the seat off, then re-tweet off
Social media this to beat off to
Damn, they think that we lost 'cause when we get off a look at themselves saying we awful
'Cause it's more than bread that we wanting
Me and Nina keeping 'em jumping
And we won't stop 'till we get to the top
You in the way then we Midwest chop ya!

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Shit, never could do right in school, I just choose to cruise by
The principal told me I'm a loser, the dude’s right
All I did as a kid was shoot dice and toot white
Causing disputes, my future was never too bright
But who would’ve knew I’d be lucky enough to get a record deal
And pursue my music? I’m too psyched, not once, but two times
I murder shit, a repeat offender with the biggest independent, salute N9ne
If they bussin' I'mma take this rappin' shit to a new height
Too tight like Drake's bike jacket, my crew like
A pack of wild wolves, 'bout to howl at the moonlight
You wanna come at us? God bless, Gesundheit
You a pussy, you might lose a fight with a bull dyke
And I already give you a fuse strike, a few of mine
Kinda swole with this now your face is basically a bullseye
And you like ooh-ah!
And I ain't quitting 'til I got a crib in Malibu, sitting poolside
I'm chilling, sipping Crown a coke bag
I say what I'm thinking, never been known to hold back
I'm pimpin' 'em steadily, putting hoes on Prozac
Blow got me looking like my nose is snow-capped
Under the scopes, steady getting groped and poked at
Then those that oppose that wanna do-si-do
Per rope-a-dope will get you K.O.'d or toe tagged
At 5'10"" you can see my 'fro from rows back
Fake friends hanging on my coast below Tech
Hate the term 'no homo' but I'm sick
Of bending over, getting fucked for the dough I don't have
Oh snap, forgot it was a chopper song
This is what you want to hear, I guess I better do a study how I execute it, therapeautic
Don't compare me, some of these rappers got a bigger pussy than the Octomom
And yo, ya-uh-yeah!

[Verse 3: Prozak]
Thinkin' about takin' it to another level
I'm from another realm like an angel falling from heaven
I fell to the Earth, the purpose of resurrection
I'm coming through your speakers like demonic possession
And hell's bells, don't be afraid of mythology
Deep inside my brain is a wicked psychology
Ancient revelation intertwined with technology
Alien biology, you know that I gotta be Strange!
Damn right, and I'm proud to be
Biggest independent label, check the biography
We taking over the industry without an apology
Burning all the bridges, tell me who wanna follow me
I'm sick with the sickness and spit with the quickness, so vicious with every bar (bar)
So best to be leaving me lonely, psychotic and mentally scarred (scarred)
And I don't really wanna be the one to tell you but I will if you don't get it by now
Our strangers are angels, and able to seal the game, you lames better bow down (bow down)
You need to recognize a miracle inside the lyrical, we're killing all these shows now
It started from the bottom, now we got the people showing up and lining up in every town
Takin' it to another planet and stratosphere
Circle like a satellite on top of this atmosphere
Snake and bat the symbol of the future, don't interfere
You don't really wanna be the one we make disappear
And this flow is hypnotic, it's class A narcotics, you pop out the bottle
Prescribed by psychologists, go for psychotic shit
Prozak and Kaliko, Rittz, Midwest Chopper shit

Just a-pickin' and a-paintin' away (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Ooh, my brothers and sisters
Still talk about how
Daddy lost his temper that day (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
You see, he built a picket fence
From the garage to the house
Well, tell me what I say
The same day the garbage man
Backed into the fence
And the whole darn thing gave way
You should have been there

No, he didn't have a PhD (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Hah, but in my eyes and down in my heart
My daddy means the world to me (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
He'll probably go out (Talkin' about daddy)
Cursin', just a-fussin'
And a-bein' mad
But I hope the Good Lord will understand ('Bout my dad)
That my daddy's is just bein' my dad
Now, now, now, now

135,1973,The Stylistics,You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart),"Mother told me always to follow the golden rule
And she said it's really a sin to be mean and cruel
So remember if you're untrue
Angels up in heaven are looking at you

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

I've been hearin' rumors about how you play around
Though I don't believe what I hear, still it gets me down
If you ever should say goodbye
It would be so awful the angels would cry

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart
Oh no!

(If you break my heart, break my heart)

I can hardly wait for the day when we say I do
It's a day I dreamed of so long now it's comin' true
You will promise to cherish me
If you break your promise the angels will see

You'll never get to heaven if you break my heart
So be very careful not to make us part
You won't get to heaven if you break my heart

Shaggy cotton skin and just one set of clothes
Sittin' on the shelf in the local department store
With no dreams to dream and nothing to be sorry for

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a wooden heart and a sawdust mind
Then your mem'ry wouldn't come around hurtin' all the time
I'd have a sewed on smile and a painted twinkle in my eye
And I never would've ever had to learn how to cry

I wish I was a Teddy Bear
Not livin' nor lovin' or goin' nowhere
I wish I was a Teddy Bear
And I'm wishin' that I hadn't fallen in love with you

I wish I had a string you'd pull to make me say
Hi, I'm Teddy ain't it a lovely day
Then I'd know every time I spoke the words were right
And no one would know the mess I made in my life

I wish I was a Teddy Bear

Lord, don't they love to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know she'll be leavin' with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then she lets her hair hang down
And she makes me glad that I'm a man
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't she make me smile
She's never far away
Or too tired to say ""I want you""

She's always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
She's still a baby to me

He had a boogie style that no one else could play
He was the top man at his craft
But then his number came up, and he was gone with the draft
He's in the Army now, a-blowin' Reveille
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

They made him blow a bugle for his Uncle Sam
It really brought him down because he could not jam
The Captain seemed to understand
Because the next day the Cap' went out and drafted a band
And now the Company jumps when he plays Reveille
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

A-root, a-toot, a-toot-diddely-ada-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar, in boogie rhythm
He can't blow a note unless the bass and guitar is playin' with 'im
A-ha-ha-hand the company jumps when he plays Reveille
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

He was some boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B
And when he plays boogie-woogie bugle he was busy as a ""bzzzy"" bee
And when he plays he makes the company jump eight-to-the-bar
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

A toot-diddelyada, toot-diddelyada, toot-toot
He blows it eight-to-the-bar
Can't blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't with 'im
A-ha-ha-hand the Company jumps when he plays Reveille
He's the boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

(bugle solo)

He puts the boys to sleep with boogie every night
And wakes 'em up the same way in the early bright
They clap their hands, and stamp their feet
'Cause they know how he blows when someone gives him a beat
Whoa-whoa he breaks it up when he plays Reveille
The boogie-woogie bugle boy of Company B

A-root, a toot, a-toot-diddely-ada-doot to-to-toot
He blows, eight to the bar
He can blow a note if the bass and guitar isn't, whoa, with him
And the company jumps when he plays Reveille

Baby, let's pretend that tonight could live forever
If we close our eyes and believe, it might come true
Baby, let's pretend we could always be together
But for now just let me spend the night with you

Somehow, someday, things are gonna be so different
Don't cry, someway I promise it'll be alright
So now that we're all alone

Asked her where she'd been
She said, I've been around the world
And it almost did me in
She said, I hope you didn't wait too long
I have no sense of time
See you've written one last song
And I realize it's mine
Think of all the times we talked
Sing a nursery rhyme

Close your eyes, I'm right beside you
Run for miles, you know I'll find you
'Cause it's all the same
Change your lovers, change your name
If you need a friend
Close your eyes, I'm back again

She really came back home last night
Seemed as if she'd changed
Said that she'd go back to school
And try things once again
But you know it didn't take too long
Till she lost her way
And all the reason in the world
Could see she couldn't stay
As I helped her pack her things
It didn't hurt to say

Close your eyes, I'm right beside you
And run for miles, you know I'll find you
'Cause it's all the same
Change your lovers, change your name
If you need a friend
Close your eyes, I'm back again

Change your lovers, change your name
If you need a friend
Close your eyes, I'm back again"

And, man, did he look pretty ill
We decided that we would have a soda

I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy
Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was ""dead""

I was a white sock sport
Wore pointed shoes and pegged pants
Drank 'til my eyes were red
Hid ""Playboy"" 'neath my bed
Slicked my d.a. for the dance (When you dance, when you dance)

Back when my hair was short
I met some friends in court
For stealing hubcaps from cars
Chain smoking under the stars
Played all night pinball in bars

And dreamed about love (Love)
We were experts on love
We talked our way all around it
And even if we had found it
We couldn't respond

Slowly I changed my ways
College and long-haired days
Seeing three concerts a week
An honest-to-God hippie freak
Too busy eating to speak

Except about love (Love)
We held rallies for love
But no one knew what they stood for
How many months were they good for?
The meaning is gone

Soon when my hair is short
I'll make a full report
Of how I came back alive (Came back, came back alive)
And what it takes to survive
Wringing the truth out of jive

I'll tell you of love (Love)
More than ever it's love
No lack of faith undermines it
'Cause it's the hope that we'll find it
That makes us go on

Back when my hair was short
I was a white sock sport
Holding beer parties 'til three
College appealed to me
Eastern philosophy"

My mother works for charity whenever she can
And they're both good clean Americans who abide by the law
And they both stick up for liberty and they both support the war

My happiness was paid for when they laid their money down
For summers in a summer camp and winters in the town
My future in the system was talked about and planned
But I gave it up for music and The Free Electric Band

I went to school in hand-washed shirts with neatly ordered hair
And the school was big and newly built and filled with light and air
And the teachers taught us values that we had to learn to keep
And they'd clip the ear of any idle kid who went to sleep

And my father organised for me a college in the east
But I went to California, the sunshine and the beach
My parents and my lecturers could never understand
Why I gave it up for music and The Free Electric Band

Well, they used to sit and speculate upon their son's career
A lawyer or a doctor or a civil engineer
Just give me bread and water, put a guitar in my hand
Cause all I need is music and The Free Electric Band

My father sent me money and I spent it very fast
On a girl I met in Berkeley in a social science class
Yes, and we learnt about her body but her mind we didn't know
Until deep rooted attitudes and morals began to show

She wanted to get married even though she never said
And I knew her well enough by now to see inside her head
She'd settle for suburbia and a little patch of land
So I gave her up for music and The Free Electric Band

Where the strange green reptiles crawl
Snakes hang thick from the cypress trees
Like sausage on a smokehouse wall
Where the swamp is alive with a thousand eyes
An' all of them watching you
Stay off the track to Hattie's Shack in the back of the Black Bayou

Way up the road from Hattie's Shack
Lies a sleepy little Okeechobee town
Talk of swamp witch Hattie lock you in when the sun go down
Rumours of what she'd done, rumours of what she'd do
Kept folks off the track of Hattie's shack
In the back of the Black Bayou

One day brought the rain and the rain stayed on
And the swamp water overflowed
'skeeters and the fever grabbed the town like a fist
Doc Jackson was the first to go
Some say the plague was brought by Hattie
There was talk of a hang'n too
But the talk got shackled by the howls and the cackles
From the bowels of the Black bayou

Early one morn 'tween dark and dawn when shadows fill the sky
There came an unseen caller on a town where hope had run dry
In the square there was found a big black round
Vat full of gurgling brew
Whispering sounds as the folk gathered round
""It came from the Black Bayou""

There ain't much pride when you're trapped inside
A slowly sink'n ship
They scooped up the liquid deep and green
And the whole town took a sip
Fever went away and the very next day the skies again were blue
Let's thank old Hattie for saving our town
We'll fetch her from the Black Bayou

Party of ten of the town's best men headed for Hattie's shack
Said Swamp Witch magic was useful and good
And they're gonna bring Hattie back
Never found Hattie and they never found the shack
Never made the trip back in
There was a parchment note they found tacked to a stump
Said, ""Don't come look'n again"""

Must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand your feelin' that way
Ev'rybody's got their life to live

Well, I can say goodbye
In the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die
In the warmth of the night

Don't you know I need to have tonight
When you're gone, till you go
I need to lie here and
Think about the last time

You'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me
Empty like before

Hey, wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us

Didn't we take each other
To a place where
No one's ever been

Yeah, I really need you
Near me tonight
'Cause you'll never take me there again

Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies

When you're gone
Till you go
I need to hold you until the tie
Your hands reach out and

Touch me in the morning

And we could feel one another living
We walked with a dream to hold
And we could take what the world was giving

There's only love and the time to chase it

Well, he specializes in talkin' trash
Carries himself like the world's biggest spender
But he ain't never got no cash
The clothes he wears are second to none
He's a Jack of all trades and a master of none
Agrees with everything he knows nothin' about
So he doesn't feel left out
Secondary all the things in life he really wants
Being in is his thing
So he's got to keep up his front

Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah
And a super-conversationalist, yes he is
Let me hear you say yeah, yeah, yeah

Well, he always borrows, never lends
He says, ""Get off me, man! I'm with him, let me in!""
Says he's willing to stick through thick and thin
But when the chips are down
People find him if you can
(Plastic man)
Claim to fame he has none
Friends in this world, maybe one
He hates being just another face in the crowd
Giving another brother five and talkin' loud

Tryin' to get over any way he can

180,1973,John Denver,I'd Rather Be A Cowboy,"Jessie went away last summer, couple of months ago
After all our time together it was hard to see her go
She called me right up when she arrived asked me one more time to come
Livin' on a LA freeway ain't my kind of havin' fun

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

We were just beginning, it was such an easy way
Layin' backup in the mountains makin' songs for sunny days
She got tired of pickin' daisies and cookin' my meals for me
She can live the life she wants to, yes, and it's all right with me

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy
Than to lay me down in love and lady's chains

I'd rather live on the side of a mountain
Than wander through the canyons of concrete and steel
I'd rather laugh with the rain and sunshine
And lay down my sundown in some starry field

Oh, but I miss her in the mornin' when I awake alone
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know
I love her, yes I love her, just enough to let her go

I think I'd rather be a cowboy
I think I'd rather ride a range
I think I'd rather be a cowboy

I'd had to have you as an enemy
From the first time we met
I knew you were the one to set me free

You liked me. I liked you
You liked me. I liked you

Holding my heart in the palm of your hand
Headed out west for the Indian lands
Dreams of the golden boy tangling your mind
Burning your body to fill in the time

Sad city sister on Avenue of Palm
I knew naively that I was your man
I followed after with heavy heart of lead
Just like a man who walks, yet is dead

I asked you to dance
And you wondered and you thought you might
So we went and took a chance
On the catwalk in the cold starlight

I held you. You felt me
I touched you. You kissed me

Holding my heart in the palm of your hand
Headed out west for the Indian lands
Dreams of the golden boy tangling your mind
Drugs aid your body to fill in the time

Sad city sister on Avenue of Palm
I knew naively that I was your man
I followed after with heavy heart of lead
Just like a man who walks, yet is dead"

There'll be another man around

What`s your mama`s name?

[Verse 1:]
Thirty some odd years ago
A young man came to Memphis
Asking about a rose
That used to blossom in his world

People never took the time
To mind the young man`s questions
Until one day
They heard him ask a little green eyed girl

[Chorus:]
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?

Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?
What`s your mama`s name, child?
What`s your mama`s name?

[Verse 2:]
Twenty some odd years ago
A drunk down in Memphis
Lost a month of life and labor to the county jail

Just because he asked
A little green eyed girl a question
And offered her a nickel`s worth of candy
If she`d tell

A year and some odd days ago
An old man died in Memphis
Just another wayward soul the county had to claim

Inside the old man`s ragged coat
They found a faded letter
It said you have a daughter
And her eyes are Wilson green

[Chorus:]
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
Does she ever talk
About a place called New Orleans?
Has she ever mentioned
A man named Buford Wilson?

What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?
What`s your mama's name, child?
What`s your mama's name?"

Is who yer don' it with
That's why, if you don't mind
I'd like to sing these words to you, see
I've got new books to read
But they aren't what I need
And this picture of you
Just won't do, no, no, baby
And the postcards you send would never (never) mend
The pain in my heart when we're apart
Girl I can make it through the day
But oh, please help me through the lonely nights
When I'm on my job It's not too hard
But when I go home
And I'm all alone (and I'm by myself babe you heard me)
You know you're my crutch I need you're sweet touch
Then it gets the night time again Lord when will it end
I'll make it through the day say, but oh
You don't know nothing about the lonely nights
Well now night go away please hurry up day
Cause my night light burns and I toss and turn
Tell me what would I see if I turned on TV
I don't know what to do, Lord knows, I need me some you
I can make it through the day
Please help me through the lonely night"

For one man alone

The nights drag by
And it gets harder all the time
To go to sleep without
Your soft skin touching mine

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Ringing half past eight
With that old familiar hunger
And my arms wrapped
Round your shadow
I woke up on your side of the bed

Another funky morning
Sunday's dead and Monday's
Dripping down my window pane

I wake up shaking
Staring at the walls and
Listening to the lonesome
Sound of falling rain

I just can't make myself
Believe that you don't care
I keep on dreaming
I'll wake up and you'll be there

And I woke up on your side
Of the bed again this morning
With my old alarm clock

Of the bed again this morning

We ran the through hills and forests
As two under a spell
He was a city boy, Floyd the outlaw
But I thought I knew him well

Long after that great summer
When I first came into my fame
And the Avenger from Oklahoma
Was added to my name
The Avenger I became

[Verse 1]
Well, they call me Avenging Annie
I'm avenger of womanhood
I spend my whole life telling lies
Lead you on and mess you over good

I take all you spoiled young hippies
Running around, playing games
Mess around in your bed, I'll blow your head
I'll put you through a change
What you've done to others
I'll do unto you

[Verse 2]
And then I met my sensitive outlaw
He was the best thing I had ever seen
I wanna be his wife forgiving my life
I was so blind I could never have seen, no
So I joined up with my outlaw
And headed for California

[Verse 3]
He treated me worse than I ever imagined
He even say he don't want me around
Kept it up so long, I couldn't be strong
He run me right into the ground
After five long years
He picked me up and then he slapped me down

[Verse 4]
When I told my friends about him
They all were on my side
And I could see through the haze he looked so crazy
I put my head right down and I cried
For my poor lover
I cried like a mother for my poor lover

[Verse 5]
Well, I felt so sad about it
But I knew I couldn't do him no good
He was so far gone while standing all alone
I left him, I knew I should
I knew I couldn't do him no good

[Verse 6]
And now I live out on a mountain top
And I'm almost thirty-five
And I've found my peace and I've found my release
And I'm happy just to be alive

And I might go back to my Floyd
If I think it's the thing to do
He gave up murder and theft right after I left
And you know I still love him too

(Reporter):
This is your action news reporter once again, and we're here at the gas station. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

(Witness):
Yeah, I did. I's just in here gettin my tires checked, he just appeared out of the traffic. Come streakin' around the grease rack there, didn't have nothin' on but a smile
I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink
I hollered, ""Don't look, Ethel!"" But it was too late. She'd already been mooned
Flashed her right there in front of the shock absorbers

(Chorus)
He ain't crude, look at that, look at that
He ain't lewd, look at that, look at that
He's just in the mood to run in the nude
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
Look at that, look at that
He likes to turn the other cheek
Look at that, look at that
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique

(Reporter):
Once again, your action news reporter in the booth at the gym, covering the disturbance at the basketball playoff. Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

(Witness):
Yeah, I did. Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow
Cone. And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling, Right down the middle of the court.
Didn't have on nothing but his PF's
Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stand. I hollered up at Ethel, I said, ""Don't look, Ethel!"" But it was too late. She'd already got a free shot. Grandstandin', right there in front of the home team

(Chorus) (Witness):
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Here he comes again)
Look at that, look at that
(Who's that with him?)
The fastest thing on two feet
(Ethel? Is that you, Ethel?)
Look at that, look at that
(What do you think you're doin'?)
He's just as proud as he can be
(You git your clothes on!)
Of his anatomy
He's gonna give us a peek
Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Ethel! Where you goin'?)
Look at that, look at that
(Ethel, you shameless hussy)
He likes to show off his physique
(Say it isn't so)
Look at that, look at that
(Ethel! Ethel!)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around

202,1974,The Stylistics,You Make Me Feel Brand New,"[Arrion Love]
My love
I'll never find the words my love
To tell you how I feel my love
Mere words could not explain

Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

[Russell Thompkins]
Only you
Cared when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love

[All]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

[Arrion Love]
My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure
You gave my pride back to me

Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

[Russell Thompkins]
Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

[All]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song for you
You"

204,1974,Gordon Lightfoot,Sundown,"I can see her lyin' back
In her satin dress
In a room where you do
What you don't confess

Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs

She's been lookin' like a queen
In a sailor's dream
And she don't always say
What she really means

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain

I can picture every move
That a man could make
Getting lost in her lovin'
Is your first mistake

Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round
My back stairs
Sometimes I think it's a sin
When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again

I can see her lookin' fast
In her faded jeans
She's a hard lovin' woman
Got me feelin' mean

Sometimes I think it's a shame
When I get feelin' better
When I'm feelin' no pain
Sundown you'd better take care
If I find you been creepin' 'round

205,1974,Bo Donaldson And The Heywoods,"Billy, Don't Be A Hero","[Verse 1:]
The marching band came down along Main Street
The soldier blues fell in behind
I looked across and there I saw Billy
Waiting to go and join the line

And with her head upon his shoulder
His young and lovely fiancee
From where I stood I saw she was crying
And through her tears I heard her say

[Chorus:]
Billy, don't be a hero
Don't be a fool with your life
Billy, don't be a hero
Come back and make me your wife

And as he started to go
She said, ""Billy, keep your head low.""
Billy, don't be hero
Come back to me

[Verse 2:]
The soldier blues were trapped on a hillside
The battle raging all around
The sergeant cried, ""We've got to hang on, boys!
We've got to hold this piece of ground.""

I need a volunteer to ride up
And bring us back some extra men.""
And Billy's hand was up in a moment
Forgetting all the words she said

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
I heard his fiancee got a letter
That told how Billy died that day
The letter said that he was a hero
She should be proud
He died that way
I heard she threw the letter away"

Help me, I think I'm falling in love again
When I get that crazy feeling, I know I'm in trouble again
I'm in trouble 'cause you're a rambler and a gambler
And a sweet taIking ladies man and you love your lovin'
But not like you love your freedom

[Verse 2]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love too fast
It's got me hoping for the future and worrying about the past
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes
Come down to smoke and ash
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom

[Verse 3]
Didn't it feel good, we were sitting there talking
Or lying there not talking, didn't it feel good
You dance with the lady with the hole in her stocking
Didn't it feel good
Didn't it feel good

[Verse 4]
Help me, I think I'm falling in love with you
Are you going to let me go there by myself
That's such a lonely thing to do
Both of us flirting around flirting and flirting, hurting too
We love our lovin' but not like we love our freedom"

A nomad known to all
With fifty girls to attend him

And you won't need no camel, no no
When I take you for a ride

And he said, Before I go
There's something about our love affair
That I have a right to know
I said, Let's not stand out here like this
What would the neighbors think?
Why don't we just step inside
And I'll fix us both a drink

My girl Bill
My, my, girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl, my girl Bill

William's hands were shaking
As he took his glass of wine
And I could see we both felt the same
And when his eyes met mine
I said, Who we love and why we love
It's hard to understand
Let's just sit here on the couch
And face this, man to man

My girl Bill
My, my, girl Bill
Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl, my girl Bill

Bill, you know we just left her place
And we both know what she said
She doesn't want to see your face
And she wishes you were dead!
Now, I know we both love her
And I guess we always will
But you're gonna have to find another
'Cause she's my girl, Bill!

Can't say enough about the way I feel
About my girl, talkin' 'bout my little girl

They will vanish away like your daddy's best jeans
Denim blue fading up to the sky

And though you want them to last forever
You know they never will
You know they never will
And the patches make the goodbye harder still

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?
There'll never be a better chance to change your mind
And if you want this world to see a better day
Will you carry the words of love with you?
Will you ride the great white bird into heaven?

And though you want to last forever
You know you never will
You know you never will
And the goodbye makes the journey harder still

Will you carry the words of love with you?
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Oh very young
What will you leave us this time?"

I must face a world of strangers
Where I don't belong
I'm not that strong
It's nice to know that there's someone I can turn to
Who will always care
You're always there

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

So many times when the city seems to be
Without a friendly face, a lonely place
It's nice to know that you'll be there if I need you
And you'll always smile, it's all worthwhile

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

Touch me and I end up singing
Trouble seems to up and disappear
You touch me with the love you're bringing
I can't really lose when you're near
When you're near, my love

If all my friends have forgotten half their promises
They're not unkind, just hard to find
One look at you
And I know that I could learn to live
Without the rest
I've found the best

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you

When there's no getting over that rainbow
When my smallest of dreams won't come true
I can take all the madness the world has to give
But I won't last a day without you"

219,1974,Anne Murray,You Won't See Me,"When I call you up, your line's engaged
I have had enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind, if you won't see me
You won't see me

I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I can turn away if you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'

Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long since you've been gone
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time you refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind if I knew what I was missin'

Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long since you've been gone
And I just can't go on, if you won't see me
You won't see me..."
220,1974,Carly Simon,Haven't Got Time For The Pain,"All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white love
Pouring down from the heaven
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you"

With all of these love starved women

Who cares, I never get lonesome

I could have lots of friends if I want to
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm egotistical
Hell, I don't even know what that means
I guess it has something to do with the way that I
Fill out my skin tight blue jeans

Came to this old town seeking fortune and some fame
Never got the chance to prove myself, though I tried to play their game

To please some fool that don't care
About they turned me inside out, I'm goin' home

My car is empty and the radio just seems to bring me down

It seems to slip away
It's warm outside, no clouds are in the sky
But I need myself a place to go and hide
I keep it to myself, I don't want nobody else
To see me cryin' all those tears in my eyes

You got to promise not to tell
If you want to get to heaven
You got to raise a little hell

238,1974,Melba Montgomery,No Charge,"My little boy came into the kitchen this evening
While I was fixing supper
And he handed me a piece of paper he'd been writing on
And after wiping my hands on my apron
I read it - and this is what it said

For mowing the yard - five dollars
And for making my own bed this week - one dollar
And for going to the store - fifty cents
An' playing with little brother, while you went shopping
Twenty-five cents
Taking out the trash - one dollar
Getting a good report card - five dollars
And for raking the yard - two dollars
Total owed - fourteen seventy-five

Well, I looked at I'm standing there expectantly
And a thousand memories flashed through my mind
So I picked up the pen, turning the paper over
This is what I wrote:

For nine months I carried you
Growing inside me - no charge
For the nights I've sat up with you
Doctored you, prayed for you - no charge
For the time and the tears
And the cost through the years, there's no charge
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love is no charge

For the nights filled with dread
And the worries ahead - no charge
For advice and the knowledge
And the cost of your college - no charge
For the toys, food and clothes and for wiping your nose
There's NO CHARGE, son
When you add it all up
The full cost of my love, is - charge

Well, when he finished readin'
He had great big old tears in his eyes
And he looked up at me and he said
""Mama, I sure do love you.""
Then he took the pen
And in great big letters
He wrote: ""Paid in full.""

When you add it all up
The cost of real love is - no charge"

What life has done to those like you and me

See the man with the broken heart, you'll see that he is sad
He hurts so bad (so bad, so bad)
See the girl who has lost the only love she ever had
There's got to be no sadder show to see
No doubt about it, satisfaction's guaranteed

So let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

See the man who's been cryin' for a million years
So many tears (so many tears)
See the girl who's collected broken hearts for souvenirs
It's more exciting than a one man band
The saddest little show in all the land

So let the sideshow begin (hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

So let the sideshow begin (Hurry, hurry)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry

Let the sideshow begin (step right on in)
Hurry, hurry, step right on in
Can't afford to pass it by
Guaranteed to make you cry (hurry, hurry)"

I took advantage of your sweet love
Don't just hand me a lifetime of sadness

Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

Can you spare me a little affection
Would that be askin' too much of you
Don't point love in another direction
I swear I'll make it all up to you

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight
Can you hear, baby?

There's a bed I'm keepin' empty for you
There's a lot I know I got to prove
Don't let a simple misunderstanding
Be a mountain that we can't move
Ooh, ooh, baby

One chain don't make no prison
Two wrongs don't make no right
One rain don't make no river
One punch don't make no fight

One chain don't make no prison

I guess you could say that I've been lucky
Well, I guess you could say that it's all because of you

If anyone should ever write my life story
For whatever reason there might be
Ooo, you'll be there between each line of pain and glory
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me
Ah, you're the best thing that ever happened to me

Oh, there have been times when times were hard
But always somehow I made it, I made it through
'Cause for every moment that I've spent hurting
There was a moment that I spent, ah, just loving you

If there's a rock n' roll heaven

And Bobby gave us Mack the Knife

When they meet in one big show

If you believe in forever
Then life is just a one-night stand

And my steam starts to rise
And the wheels keep turning
Faster as I think of all your lies

Oh that train of thought runnin' right on time
But it's off the track and I'm losing my mind
'Cause the way you used me
Gonna drive me insane honey
Say you'll never leave me
For God's sake stop the train

Oh the camel back is broken
By the one extra straw added on
And a woman can't see reason
When her last ray of sunshine is gone
There's a finger on the trigger
And that locomotive sound
And I think how much I love you
And I turn the gun around

Oh that train of thought runnin' right on time
But it's off the track and I'm losing my mind
And you hold me the last time
As I try to explain, honey
Don't feel bad about me
I just had to stop this train

Gotta get off, gotta get off (woo-woo)

Finally got off work like this that, this that ride
To vacation, across 110th Street was blazing
For the motherless children that related to Mahalia

Let the music be your secret lover like Atlantic Starr
New Birth, Wildflower was that jamming shit by far
And Eddie Kendricks' voice will have you singing in your car
I know, I know, I know Marvin played at your home
But that's the reason why your parents had to get it on
That's the reason why you're probably here anyway
Don't fret, you can play that bullshit any day
But, I'm just saying it's a whole catalog
Of analog, the warmer sounds you've ever saw

(Let me give my life to you
Come let me love you, come love me again)

You fill up my senses, like a night in a forest
Like the mountains in springtime, like a walk in the rain
Like a storm in the desert, like a sleepy blue ocean
You fill up my senses, come fill me again"

Here comes the daylight
It's makin' me sad
Here comes the sunlight
Makin' me sad
Had a good time last night
Best I ever had
Here come the sunshine
That's makin' me sad
So sad, so sad, so sad, so sad
Here come the daybreak
It's bringin' me pain
It's causin' me heartache
I wish it would rain
Had a good time last night
Just me and my friends
But here come the daylight
And now it's the end
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

It's bringin' me down
Causin' me heartache
It's spinnin' my head around, yeah

Had a good time last night
In the moon's glimpse
Now all that'll save me
Is a total eclipse
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no..."

Every since last year every month feels like October to me
It's just that feeling man

[Verse 1: James Craig]
October to me seems like a memory
The Girls on tumblr tellin me they in love with me
Yeah
Except a few girls from the city tho
They misguided
They always lying
Could Never tell me the truth
Like who she sleeping with too
Saying I would have a chance
But I end up getting used
And
I got used to it
So anything she told me I wasn't new to it
I would just adapt to it
Put on a mask like I'm Jim Carey I would just act through it
Sometimes I had to tweet through it
Some nights I had the henny bottle I would drink through it
Feeling ran deep into my heart like a cavity
Actually
I felt so disconnected from reality
Stuck in this me and you fantasy
Why can I not be with you
After all the things you put me through

[Hook : James Craig]
October to me
October to me seems like a memory
Yeah
October to me
October to me
Seems like a memory

[Verse 2 : James Craig ]
I should  listen to friends more
But It's too many drinks being poured
Right now
I remember one time I was 38 points in the friend zone
I should've packed up like Lebron and just went home
Man
I was confused and couldn't let go
Learned the hard way some of these women are just cutthroat
We can talk later I just need to get my mixing on
I just to need to reminisce with some in scents on
I just need to let the Tea burn one time
I just need to let the Tea burn one time
So I can match the beat with the tears in my eyes
Had to realize that she was full of lies
She probably staring at her phone
Wondering why I won't reply [x3]
I told her to Take Care
Cause Nothing was the same
I am So Far Gone
If You're Reading This It's Too Late
I needed Room For Improvement
On my Comeback Season
I wouldn't let go but she gave me a reason
Left me on this microphone heart still bleeding
Ear waiting for the phone my subconscious can  still hear it ringing

You get up every morning from alarm clock's warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There's a whistle up above and people pushing, people shoving
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train's on time, you can get to work by nine
And start your slavin' jobs and get your pay
If you ever get annoyed, look at me, I'm self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day

[Chorus]
And I've been takin' care of business, every day
Takin' care of business, every way
I've been takin' care of business, it's all mine
Takin' care of business and working overtime, work out

[Verse 2]
If it were easy as fishing, you could be a musician
If you could make sounds loud or mellow
Get a secondhand guitar, chances are you'll go far
If you get in with the right bunch of fellows
People see you having fun just a-lying in the sun
You tell them that you like it this way
It's the work that we avoid and we're all self-employed
We love to work at nothing all day

Yes, we do, and we hate our own self

There's even hate going on today
Between the young folks and the old
Can't see all this hate is really
Eating up our very soul

And if you don't wanna sing along
Maybe you can clap your hands

To love your enemy
But we don't comprehend
Tell me, how can you love your enemy
When you hate your fellow man

You see, love's got the
All-time greatest power
You see, love can brighten up
Your darkest hour

283,1974,Jim Croce,Workin' At The Car Wash Blues,"Well I had just got out from the county prison
Doin' 90 days for non-support
Tried to find me an executive position
But no matter how smooth I talked
They wouldn't listen to the fact that I was genius
The man said, ""We got all that we can use.""
Now I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues

Well I should be sittin' in an air conditioned
Office with a swivel chair
Talkin' some trash to the secretary, sayin'
""Hey now mama, come on over here.""
Instead I'm stuck here rubbin' these fenders with a rag
And walkin' home in soggy old shoes
With them steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues

You know a man of my ability
He should be smokin' on a big cigar
But till I get myself straight
I guess I'll just have to wait
In my rubber suit rubbin' these cars

Well, all I can do is just shake my head
You might not believe that it's true
For working at this end of Niagara Falls
Is an undiscovered Howard Hughes

So baby, don't 'spect to see me
With no double martini
In any high-brow society news
Cause I got them
Steadily depressin', low down mind-messin'
Workin' at the carwash blues

So baby, don't 'spect to see me
With no double martini

And finish what we started, oh baby
I need to know

Who are you

Who are you gonna give yourself to
And what are your plans
Tell me, baby

And where are you going
Will you give yourself to me

You intended to finish

That I had been used
But I liked it
And when I couldn't find you
Lord, it gave me the blues

And if I sent a rose of white
For every time I cried all night
You'd have a room full of roses

And if I took the petals
I would tear them all apart
I'd be tearing at the roses
Just the way you broke my heart

If someday you're feeling blue
And you could send a roses, maybe too
Don't send me a room full of roses

I'm stayin' here with some friends

By a cafe where I hope to be workin' soon

Would you come home to me?""

Now won't you settle down?
Boston ain't your kind of town
There ain't no gold and
There ain't nobody like me
I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee.""

Please come to Denver with the snowfall
We'll move up into the mountains so far
That we can't be found
And throw ""I love you"" echoes down the canyon
And then lie awake at night until they come back around
Please come to Denver

Boy, would you come home to me?""

Now, this drifter's world goes 'round and 'round
And I doubt that it's ever gonna stop
But of all the dreams I've lost or found
And all that I ain't got
I still need to lean to
Somebody I can sing to

Please come to L.A. to live forever
A California life alone is just too hard to build
I live in a house that looks out over the ocean
And there's some stars that fell from the sky
And livin' up on the hill
Please come to L.A
She just said, ""No
Boy, won't you come home to me?""

And the moon stood still
For the night bird's song

We'll fly with the wind

There'll be nothing left

Full of empty space
Like the empty look
I see on your face

Pero si te hace llorar
A mi me puedes hablar
Y estare contigo cuando triste estas

All you're really lookin' for's
An even break
He lies right at you
You know you hate this game
Slaps you once in a while
And you live in love and pain

315,1975,Carpenters,Only Yesterday,"After long enough of being alone
Everyone must face their share of loneliness
In my own time nobody knew
The pain I was going through
And waiting was all my heart could do

Hope was all I had until you came
Maybe you can't see how much you mean to me
You were the dawn breaking the night
The promise of morning light
Filling the world surrounding me

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

I have found my home here in your arms
Nowhere else on earth I'd really rather be
Life waits for us, share it with me
The best is about to be
And so much is left for us to see

And when I hold you
Baby, baby, feels like maybe
Things will be all right
Baby, baby, your love's made me
Free as a song singing forever

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me
Tomorrow may be even brighter than today
Since I threw my sadness away
Only yesterday

Only yesterday when I was sad and I was lonely
You showed me the way to leave the past and all its tears behind me

She comes down from Yellow Mountain
On a dark, flat land she rides
On a pony she named Wildfire
With a whirlwind by her side
On a cold Nebraska night

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Oh, they say she died one winter
When there came a killing frost
And the pony she named Wildfire
Busted down his stall
In a blizzard, she was lost

[Chorus]
She ran calling Wildfire
Calling Wildfire
Calling Wildfire

[Verse 3]
So by the dark of the moon, I planted
But there came an early snow
Been a hoot-owl howling outside my window now
'Bout six nights in a row
She's coming for me, I know
And on Wildfire we're both gonna go

[Chorus]
We'll be ridin' Wildfire
Ridin' Wildfire
Ridin' Wildfire

On Wildfire we're gonna ride
Gonna leave sodbustin' behind
Get the hard times right on out of our minds

Tomorrow for old England she sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of rainy skies and gales
And I shall be aboard that ship tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this farewell

For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

I've heard there's a wicked war a-blazing
And the taste of war I know so very well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire as we sail into Hell
I have no fear of death, it brings no sorrow
But how bitter will be this last farewell

For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, and I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell

Though death and darkness gather all about me
And my ship be torn apart upon the seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
And the heaving waves that brought me once to thee
And should I return safe home again to England
I shall watch the English mist roll through the dale

For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell
For you are beautiful, I have loved you dearly
More dearly than the spoken word can tell"

There's a new kind of dancing
That's gonna be the rage
You just leave yourself behind
Like an actor on a stage

Cop a different pose
From the pose you're in
Shine a different attitude
From underneath your skin

Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitide
Attitude dancing
Any attitude is the proper attitude
Attitude dancing
Don't be afraid to change your attitude
Attitude dancing
Free up your spirit with a new attitude

It don't even matter
If you stretch or shake
And it don't really matter
What moves your body makes

And it don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Only one thing matters:
That's your attitude
Your attitude, attitude dancing

Attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a different attitide
Attitude dancing
Learn to move in another attitude
Attitude dancing
Find the groove in a new attitude
Attitude dancing
Don't be afraid of a new attitude

It don't really matter
What steps you choose to do
Only one thing matters:
Is your attitude

Your attitude, attitude dancing
Strut around the floor in a new attitude
Do the locomotion in a new attitude
Do the mashed potato in a new attitude
Do the hully gully in a new attitude

Find a role you like
Capture it and freeze
Then turn it around
A hundred and eighty degrees
Or if you're at a loss
Observe some natural dude
And turn into a mirror of his attitude
Attitude, attitude, attitude

He up and wed

Then the family was my daddy
And me and Judy Mae

Well, my daddy did a lot of traveling around
And before he would say goodbye
He'd tell me to take care of my new mama
She's the apple of his eye

And as he kissed his brand new wife goodbye
I always used to hear him say
Look after my boy
Won't you please, now, Judy Mae

Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine
Every time Papa got ready to leave

Well, one night while my daddy was gone
She tiptoed into my room
She said that she had to talk to me
Cause my dad was gonna be home soon

She said, you know
I get so lonely and cold
When your daddy is gone for days
What a boy like you could do to Judy Mae

Well, I told her that I'd never done this before
And then she took my hand
And showed me all of the secret things
That turned a boy into a man

And as I lay there by her side
I heard a noise at the window pane
I think that's just the wind
Said Judy Mae

Judy Mae
Oh, she sure had a way of looking after me
Yes, her eyes would sparkle and shine

Daddy had an accident
And two days later, he died

Could drive too good to even
Try to take a turn that wide

I betcha I can make it rain

Somebody beat the drum

But I swear before this day is over
You folks are gonna see some rain

They all just stood there a-staring
Trying to believe

Who said he was a lying cheat

Well, you oughta be ashamed
Starting all these people dreaming
Thinking you can make it rain

353,1975,The Spinners,Sadie,"[Intro]
In a world like today
It's a rare occasion to be able to see young mothers
Like the ones that were around when I grew up
But they live on in memory to quite a few of us
And this song is dedicated to those who cherish that memory

[Verse 1]
Early one Sunday morning
Breakfast was on the table
There was no time to eat
She said to me
""Boy, hurry to Sunday school""
Filled with her load of glory
We learned the holy story
She'll always have her dreams
Despite the things
This troubled world can bring

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie
Don't you know we love you?
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie (Well, well, well)
Living in the past
Some times it seems so funny
But no money will turn your life around

[Verse 2]
Sweeter than cotton candy
Stronger than papa's old brandy
Always that needed smile
Once in awhile
She would break down and cry
Sometimes she'd be so happy
Just being with us and daddy
Standing the worst of times
Breaking the binds
With just a simple song

[Chorus]
Oh, Sadie (Oh, Sadie, baby)
Don't you know we love you?
(She'll love us all in a special way)
Sweet Sadie (Well, well, well)
Place no one above you
Sweet Sadie (Sweet Sadie livin' in the past)
Living in the past
Oh, she's never sinnin'
In love, she's always winnin', yeah

Sadie (My, my, my, my, my)
Don't you know we love you?
(I love you, mama)
Sweet Sadie
Place no one above you (I just can't forget)
Sweet Sadie (How you gave me love, oh, Lord)
Living in the past
If there's a heaven up above
I know she's teaching angels how to love

Sadie (It's a mean world without you)
Don't you know we love you?
Sweet Sadie (All the love you showed)
Place no one above you (Oh, I could never, ever doubt her lovely word)

Sweet Sadie
Living in the past
Ain't it funny that in the end, it's not money?
It's just the love you gave us all"

For Khrushchev and Kennedy (Ooh, ooh)
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline (Ooh, ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah (Ooh, ooh)
(Killer, killer, she's a killer Queen)
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

[Pre-Chorus]
Perfume came naturally from Paris (Naturally)
For cars, she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind

Anytime

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat (Ooh)
Then momentarily out of action (Ooh)
Temporarily out of gas (Ta-taaa)
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's out to get you

[Chorus]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam (Pa-pa-pa-ra)
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Ooh
Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try ."

Hearing your voice
And the things that you said well they left me
Left me no choice
And you told me we had the power
And you told me this was the hour
That you don't know how
If I could show you now

Well I dreamed last night you were calling
Calling my name
You were locked inside of you secrets
Calling my name
And you told me lost was the key
And you told me how you long to be free
That you don't know how
Oh let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you
Don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Oh don't be afraid

If there's a time
And a place to begin love

It must be now
Let it go
Set it free

Oh I dreamed last night I was hearing
Hearing your voice
Why did you say those things that have left me
Left me no choice
When you told me we had the power
Why did you tell me now was the hour
But you don't know how
Oh let me show you now

Like a bird on a far distant mountain
Like a ship on an uncharted sea
You are lost in the arms that have found you
Oh don't be afraid
Love's plans are made
Don't be afraid

I got good Kentucky whiskey on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the pain
'Til some button-pushing cowboy plays that love song
And here I am, just missing you again

Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again

If I had a dime for every time I held you
Though you're far away, you've been so close to me
I could swear I'd be the richest girl in Nashville
Maybe even in the state of Tennessee

But I guess I'd better get myself together
Cause when you left, you didn't leave too much behind
Just a note that said, ""I'm sorry"", by your picture
And a song that's weighing heavy on my mind

Please, mister, please, don't play B-17
It was our song, it was his song but it's over
Please, mister, please, if you know what I mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song again"

377,1975,Mac Davis,Burnin' Thing,"When I'm thinking bout you, baby
There's a bittersweet pain
Way down deep in the secret part of me

It's a sweet, persistent craving
Slowly driving me insane
Way down deep in the very heart of me
It's got me burning with desire
And only you can stop the fire

It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing

When you're not right here beside me
All the world is standing still
Girl, I need what only you can give to me

There's an emptiness inside me
Only you alone can fill
Girl, I need for you and love with me

It's got me going up in flames
And only you can bring the rain

It's a burning thing
Baby, it's got a hold on me
It's a burning thing
Way down deep in the soul of me
It's a burning thing
Baby, my love for you is a burning thing

378,1975,The Beach Boys,Sail On Sailor,"[Verse 1]
I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor
I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor

[Verse 2]
Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor

[Verse 3]
I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying

[Outro]
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor
Sail on, sail on sailor

That big old moon is shining down
Tell me now, don't it remind you
Of a blanket on the ground

Remember back when love first found us
We'd go slipping out of town
And we'd love beneath the moonlight
On a blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we are married
Don't mean we can't slip around
So let's walk out through the moonlight
And lay the blanket on the ground

Oh, remember how excited
We used to get when love was young
That old moon was our best buddy
We couldn't wait for night to come

Now you know you still excite me
I know you love me like I am
Just once more I wish you'd love me
On the blanket on the ground

I'll get the blanket from the bedroom
And we'll go walking once again
To that spot down by the river
Where our sweet love first began
Just because we our married
Don't mean we can't slip around

To grow wings and fly away

393,1975,Shirley Caesar,No Charge,"My sister's little boy came in the kitchen one evening
While she was fixing supper
And he handed her a piece paper he had been writing on
And after wiping her hands on an apron
She took it in her hands and read it
And this is what it said:

For mowing the yard five dollars
And for making up my own bed this week one dollar
For going to the store fifty cents
And playing with little brother while you went shopping twenty five cents
Taking out the trash one dollar
And for getting a good report card five dollars
And for raking the yard two dollars
Total owed one fourteen seventy five

Well she looked at him standing there and expecting
And a thousand memories flashed through her mind
So she picked up pen and turned the paper over and this is what she wrote:

For the 9 months I carried you holding you inside me $ no charge
For the nights I sat up with doctored you and prayed for you $ no charge
For the time and tears and the costs through the years
There is no charge
When you add it all up the full cost of my love is $ no charge

For the nights filled with grey
And the worries ahead
For the advice and the knowledge
And the costs of your college
There is no charge
For the toys, school, and clothes
And for wiping your nose
There's no charge son
When you add it all the full cost of my love is no charge

Well you know when I think about that
I think about the day that jesus went out to calvary and gave his life as a ransom for me
When I think on the words ""if any man be in christ he's a new creature""
I like to think about the very minute that he shedded his blood
My debt was paid in full
And I want you to know today
When you add it all up
The full cost of real love is no charge"

There's still some things
That you don't understand now

That I want you to know now
Just as sure as the wind's gonna blow now
The men'll come
And the men are gonna go now
Before you tell 'em that you love 'em so now
My mama told me
You better shop around

Try to get yourself a bargain, girl
Don't be sold on the very first one
Good-looking guys come a dime a dozen
Try to find you one who's gonna give you true loving

Make sure he's in love with you now
Make sure that his love is true now
I hate to see you feeling sad and blue now

You've got to put your faith in things you can touch
If you dare to

Cos the shadows, can make you crazy with the things they reveal
They show it all without revealing too much
Scare the hell out of you

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows

In the shadows, you've got to work at love to get it to shine
You can't believe in everything that you see
Not this time around

Cos the shadows, can play a half a million tricks on your mind
You try your best but you can never be free
It just kinda drags you down

Cos me and my love, live among the shadows
Where the old playground is an alley way
Now me and my love, make love among the shadows
When the sun goes down, in a dark hallway
Love in the shadows where the crowd never goes
Deep in the shadows where flowers won't grow
Me and my baby know, love in the shadows"

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it today

God I must be crazy to express myself this way
But there ain't much romance livin' in the U.S.A
This guitar is a blessing, this piano is a muse
And electricity's a devil with a twenty amp fuse

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it to, gonna mail it today

Dear mama, papa hey your boy is doin' fine
And this energy, you gave him
Keeps on tryin' to unwind
'Cause I see an ancient rhythm
In a man's genetic code
Gonna keep on rock and rollin'
Fill my genes explode

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna sign it, gonna seal it, gonna mail it away
Gonna mail it today

This is my rock and roll love letter to you
This is my rock and roll love letter to you
Gonna rock it, gonna seel it, gonna slake it away
Send me back one, send me back on someday"
429,1976,Steve Miller,Take The Money And Run,"[Intro]
Hoo hoo

[Verse 1]
This here's a story 'bout Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue
Two young lovers with nothing better to do
Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube
And here's what happened when they decided to cut loose

They headed down to, ooh, old El Paso
That's where they ran into a great big hassle
Billy Joe shot a man while robbing his castle
Bobbie Sue took the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Verse 2]
Billy Mack is a detective down in Texas
You know he knows just exactly what the facts is
He ain't gonna let those two escape justice
He makes his living off of the people's taxes

Bobbie Sue, whoa, whoa, she slipped away
Billy Joe caught up to her the very next day
They got the money, hey
You know they got away
They headed down south, and they're still running today
Singing

[Chorus]
Go on, take the money and run
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh Lord
Go on, take the money and run
Hoo hoo hoo

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah
Go on, take the money and run (Yeah, yeah)
Hoo hoo hoo
Go on, take the money and run, oh Lord
Go on, take the money and run (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
The wind blew some luck in my direction
I caught it in my hands today
I finally made a tricky French connection
You winked and gave me your o.k

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothing like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Verse 2]
We'll lay back and observe the constellations
And watch the moon smilin' bright
I'll play the radio on southern stations
Cause southern belles are hell at night

You say you came to Baltimore from Ole Miss
Class of seven four gold ring
The eastern moon looks ready for a wet kiss
To make the tide rise again

[Chorus]
Moonlight
Feels right
Moonlight
Feels right

[Bridge]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
We'll see the sun come up on Sunday morning
And watch it fade the moon away
I guess you know I'm giving you a warning
Cause me and moon are itching to play

I'll take you on a trip beside the ocean
And drop the top at Chesapeake Bay
Ain't nothin' like the sky to dose a potion
The moon'll send you on your way

Guess who just got back today?
Them wild-eyed boys that'd been away
Haven't changed, hadn't much to say

How you was, where you could be found
Told them you were livin' downtown
Drivin' all the old men crazy

You know that chick that used to dance a lot?
Every night, she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
Man, when I tell ya she was cool, she was red hot
I mean she was steamin'
And that time over at Johnny's place
Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face
Man, we just fell about the place
If that chick don't wanna know, forget her

Spread the word around...
Guess who's back in town!
You spread the word around!

Friday night they'll be dressed to kill
Down at Dino's bar and grill
The drink will flow, and blood will spill
And if the boys wanna fight, you better let 'em
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favourite song
The nights are gettin' warmer, it won't be long
Won't be long 'til summer comes
Now that the boys are here again

The boys are back in town
The boys are back in town

Gonna grab some afternoon delight

When everything's a little clearer in the light of day
And we know the night is always gonna be here anyway

Looking forward to a little afternoon delight
Rubbing sticks and stones together, make the sparks ignite

You run around town like a fool and you think that it's groovy
You're giving it to some other guy
Who gives you the eye

You painted a smile and you dress all the while to excite me
But don't you know you're turning me on?
I know that it's wrong
But I can't stop the pain inside me

Baby, love really hurts without you

And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do?
Baby, love really hurts without you
Love really hurts through and through
And it's breaking my heart, but what can I do without you?

You walk like a dream and you make like you're queen of the action
You're using every trick in the book
The way that you look
You're really something to see
You cheat and you lie to impress any guy that you fancy

But don't you know I'm out of my mind
So give me a sign
And help to ease the pain inside me

Crapped out, yawning
Longing my life away

But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers

Let me ask you a question, darling
Last night, I had thirty-five
Dollars in my pocket
Did you go through my pockets

That's what I thought happened
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes...)
I'm gonna ask you another question, baby
My car, you borrowed my car, didn't you
Did you bash the side in, baby
With the light hanging out
And the wheel falling off

Right on, right on, right on

You didn't tell me about it
Did you, baby

Just left it in the garage
With trash piled up
All over the top of it
Right on, right on, baby
It's wonderful being
Married to you, darling
Thirty-five dollars
Missing out of my pocket
Car hanging all on the side
But I love you
One other question, baby
Your checking account
Is it overdrawn, baby (yes)
Is it overdrawn, baby (yes)
Right on, right on
Is it overdrawn
There's no money left
To do anything with except
Just keep writing, writing checks
Right on

It's overdrawn, ain't it, baby
Right on, right on for overdrawn

In the closet here
With my pajamas on

Don't say that, baby
Don't say that, darling
Cause if it is, darling
I got to leave
Baby, I got to leave
Right on, right on for leaving

That you wanna get the
People out the closet and
Put the money back in the account
And get the car fixed..."
449,1976,Keith Carradine,I'm Easy,"{Intro}

It's not my way to love you
Just when no one's looking
It's not my way to take
Your hand if I'm not sure

It's not my way to let you see
What's going on inside of me
When it's a love you
Won't be needing, you're not free

Please stop pulling at my sleeve
If you're just playing
If you won't take the things
You make me want to give

I never cared too much for games
And this one's driving me insane
You're not half as free
To wander as you claim

But I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy

Don't lead me on
If there's nowhere
For you to take me
If loving you will have
To be a sometime thing

I can't put bars on my insides
My love is something I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall
The times I've tried

I'm easy, yeah I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Don't do me favors
Let me watch you from a distance
Cause when you're near
I find it hard to keep my head

When your eyes throw light at mine
It's enough to change my mind
Make me leave my
Cautious words and ways behind

That's why I'm easy, yeah, I'm easy
Say you want me, I'll come running
Without taking time to think
Because I'm easy

Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight
Because I'm easy

Yeah, I'm easy
Give the word, I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy"

Flute player, play your flute 'cause I know
That you want to get your thing off

It's got to be the rhythm, no doubt about it, whoa whoa
Cause when the guitar player start playing
With the syncopated rhythm, with the scratch, scratch, scratch
Makes me wanna move my body, yeah, yeah, yeah
And when the drummer starts beating that beat
He nails that beat with the syncopated rhythm
With the rat, tat, tat, tat, tat, tat on the drums, hey!

457,1976,Jimmy Dean,I.O.U.,"You know most people look through their wallets or their pocketbooks
And way down at the bottom Past the credit cards and baby pictures, greenstamps, you usually find a little old dog eared piece poetry

I was cleaning out my wallet the other day and I ran across a whole bunch of I.O.U.'s some of them thirty years overdue. Funny thing is that all these I.O.U.'s are owed to one person, and I kinda feel like right now might be a pretty good time for an accounting

Mom, you listenin?

Mom, I owe you for so many things, a lot of services, like night watchman for instance, for lying awake nights listening for coughs, cries, creaking floorboards and me coming in too late. You had the eye of an eagle, the roar of a lion, but you always had a heart as big as a house

I owe you for services as a short order cook, chef, baker, for making sirloin out of hamburger, turkey out of tuna fish and two big ol' strapping boys out of leftovers

I owe you for cleaning services, for the daily scrubbing of face and ears all work done by hand and for the frequent dusting of a small boys pants to try to make sure that he led a spotless life and for washing and ironing, no laundry could ever do. For drying the tears of childhood and for Ironing out the problems of growing up

I owe you for servics as a bodyguard, for protecting me from the terrors of thunderstorms and nightmares ha, and too many green apples

And Lord knows I owe you for medical attention, for nursing me through measles, mumps, bruises, bumps, splinters and spring fever
And let's not forget medical advise either, Oh, no
Important things like ha ha, don't scratching it or it won't get well
If you cross your eyes they're gonna stick like that And probably ah, most Important of all was, be sure you got on clean underwear boy, in case you're in an accident

And I owe you for veterinarian services, for feeding every lost dog that I dragged home at the end of the rope and for healing the pains of puppy love

And I owe you for entertainment, entertainment that kept the household going during some pretty tough times, for wonderful productions at Christmas, 4th of July and birthdays, and for making make believe come true on a very limited budget

I owe you for construction work, for building kites, confidence, hopes and dreams and somehow you made em all touch the sky

And for cementing a family together so it would stand the worst kinds of shocks and blows and for laying down a good strong foundation to build a life on

I owe you for carrying charges, for carrying me on your books for the necessities of life that a growing boy just gotta have. Things like, a oh, a pair of high top boots with a little pocket on the side for a jackknife

And one thing, Mom, I will never ever forget when there were two pieces of apple pie left and three hungry people I noticed that you were the one who suddenly decided that you really didn't like apple pie in the 1st place

These are just a very few of the things for which payment is long overdue, the person I owe em to worked very cheap
She managed by simply doing without a whole lotta things that she needed herself

My I.O.U.'s add up to much more than I could ever hope to repay
But you know the nicest thing about it all is that, I know that she'll mark the entire bill paid in full for just one kiss and four little words

Mom, I love you"

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality

Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

Coming off the lot with a car, no ribbon
Pin-up models is all I'm pinning

Prove that I aren't, and I'll move to the part
Of the city where niggas who lose go
I don't lose, though

When I'm looking at a motherfucker that I know I used to go to school with
And they acting like we best friends and I never been cool and I never even knew him

488,1976,Wayne Newton,The Hungry Years,"Girl we made it to the top
We went so high we couldn't stop
We climbed the ladder leading us nowhere
Two of us together building castles in the air
We spun so fast we couldn't tell
The gold ring from the carousel
How could we know the right would turn-out bad
Everything we wanted, was everything we had

I miss the Hungry Years
The once upon a time
The lovely long ago
We didn't a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the World
I now hunger for
Looking through my tears

I miss the Hungry years
We shared our day dreams one by one
Making plans was so much fun
We set our goals and reached the highest star
Things that we were after were much better from afar
Here we stand just me and you
With everything and nothing too
It wasn't worth the price we had to pay
Honey take me home Let's go back to yesterday

I miss the Hungry Years
The once upon a time the lovely long ago
We didn't have a dime
Those days of me and you
We lost along the way
How could I be so blind
Not to see the door
Closing on the World I now hunger for
Looking through my tears
I miss the Hungry years

In a lonely room
Hardly knew her mama
And her daddy left too soon

She never seemed to fit in with the other kids around
Late at night
She took out her pen
And this is what she wrote down:

Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
""We know who you are""

Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life

By the time she turned sixteen
She was twenty-one
Knew every name on the silver screen
And everything they'd done

But when it came time to lay herself down to dream
It wasn't them she saw up there
It was ""Norma Jean""

Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
""We know who you are""

Norma Jean wants to see her name in lights
She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life

Before too long
She had her fortune and fame
But it wasn't Norma Jean
Marilyn was her name

She died in L.A. in a lonely room
Nobody knew her
But they knew she died too soon

By the time it was too late
Lord, we began to care
If you can hear me now
This is my prayer

Norma Jean wants to be a movie star
She wants to shine
Hear people say
""We know who you are""

She wants to dance
She wants to live the good life"

In a bar in Toledo
Across from the depot
On a bar stool she took off her ring
I thought I'd get closer
So I walked on over
I sat down and asked her name

When the drinks finally hit her
She said I'm no quitter
But I finally quit living on dreams
I'm hungry for laughter
And here ever after
I'm after whatever the other life brings

In the mirror I saw him
And I closely watched him
I thought how he looked out of place
He came to the woman
Who sat there beside me
He had a strange look on his face

The big hands were calloused
He looked like a mountain
For a minute I thought I was dead
But he started shaking
His big heart was breaking
He turned to the woman and said

[Chorus:]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille

[Verse 2:]
After he left us
I ordered more whiskey
I thought how she'd made him look small
From the lights of the bar room
To a rented hotel room
We walked without talkin' at all

She was a beauty
But when she came to me
She must have thought I'd lost my mind
I couldn't hold her
'Cuz the words that he told her
Kept coming back time after time

[Repeat Chorus:]
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille
With four hungry children
And a crop in the field
I've had some bad times
Lived through some sad times
But this time you're hurting won't heal
You picked a fine time to leave me, Lucille"

513,1977,The Marshall Tucker Band,Heard It In A Love Song,"[Verse 1]
I ain't never been with a woman long enough for my boots to get old
We've been together so long now they both need re-soled
If I ever settle down you'd be my kind
And it's a good time for me to head on down the line

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Verse 2]
I'm the kind of man who likes to get away
Like to start dreaming 'bout tomorrow today
Never said that I love you even though it's so
Where's that duffel bag of mine, it's time to go

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Flute, Piano, and Guitar Solos]

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna be leavin' at the break of dawn
Wish you could come but I don't need no woman taggin' along
Goin' sneak out that door, couldn't stand to see you cry
I'd stay another year if I saw a teardrop in your eye

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong

[Verse 4]
I never had a damn thing but what I had, I had to leave it behind
You're the hardest thing I ever tried to get off my mind
Always something greener on the other side of that hill
I was born a wrangler and a rounder and I guess I always will

[Chorus]
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Heard it in a love song
Can't be wrong"
514,1977,Eagles,Life In The Fast Lane,"[Verse 1]
He was a hard-headed man
He was brutally handsome, and she was terminally pretty
She held him up, and he held her for ransom in the heart
Of the cold, cold city
He had a nasty reputation as a cruel dude
They said he was ruthless, they said he was crude
They had one thing in common, they were good in bed
She'd say, ""Faster, faster. The lights are turnin' red.""

[Chorus 1]
Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Are you with me so far?

[Verse 2]
Eager for action and hot for the game
The coming attraction, the drop of a name
They knew all the right people, they took all the right pills
They threw outrageous parties, they paid heavenly bills
There were lines on the mirror, lines on her face
She pretended not to notice, she was caught up in the race
Out every evening, until it was light
He was too tired to make it, she was too tired to fight about it

[Chorus 2]
Life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

[Verse 3]
Blowin' and burnin', blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign, took a turn for the worst
She said, ""Listen, baby, you can hear the engine ring.""
""We've been up and down this highway, haven't seen a goddamn thing.""
He said, ""Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash.""
""The doctor says he's comin', but you gotta pay in cash.""
They went rushin' down that freeway, messed around and got lost
They didn't care, they were just dyin' to get off

[Chorus 2]
And it was life in the fast lane, Surely makes you lose your mind
Life in the fast lane, Huh
Life in the fast lane, Everything all the time
Life in the fast lane, Huh

[Outro]
Life in the fast lane
Life in the fast lane"

When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you
It's only a heartbeat away

When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love
I never knew there was so much love
Keeping me warm night and day


[Verse 1]
Miles and miles of empty space in between us
A telephone can't take the place of your smile
But you know I won't be traveling forever
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do


[Hook]
When I need you
I just close my eyes and I'm with you
And all that I so want to give you, babe
It's only a heartbeat away


[Verse 2]
It's not easy when the road is your driver
Honey, that's a heavy load that we bear
But you know I won't be traveling a lifetime
It's cold out, but hold out and do like I do

Oh, I need you


[Hook]
When I need love
I hold out my hands and I touch love

516,1977,Eagles,Hotel California,"[Verse 1: Don Henley]
On a dark desert highway
Cool wind in my hair
Warm smell of colitas
Rising up through the air
Up ahead in the distance
I saw a shimmering light
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
I had to stop for the night
There she stood in the doorway
I heard the mission bell
And I was thinking to myself
""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell""
Then she lit up a candle
And she showed me the way
There were voices down the corridor
I thought I heard them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
Plenty of room at the Hotel California
Any time of year (Any time of year)
You can find it here""

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
She got the Mercedes Benz, uh
She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
That she calls friends
How they dance in the courtyard
Sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember
Some dance to forget
So I called up the Captain
""Please bring me my wine""
He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since 1969""
And still those voices are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night
Just to hear them say

[Chorus: Don Henley]
""Welcome to the Hotel California
Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
Such a lovely face
They living it up at the Hotel California
What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)
Bring your alibis""

[Verse 3: Don Henley]
Mirrors on the ceiling
The pink champagne on ice
And she said: ""We are all just prisoners here
Of our own device""
And in the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember, I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
""Relax,"" said the night man
""We are programmed to receive
You can check out any time you like
But you can never leave!""

517,1977,Barry Manilow,Looks Like We Made It,"[Verse 1]
There you are
Looking just the same as you did last time I touched you
And here I am
Close to getting tangled up inside the thought of you

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you love him
As much as I love her?
And will that love be strong
When old feelings start to stir?

[Chorus]
Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it

[Verse 2]
Love's so strange
Playing hide and seek with hearts and always hurting
And we're the fools
Standing close enough to touch those burning memories

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I hold you
For the sake of all those times
Love made us lose our minds
Could I ever let you go?

[Chorus]
Whoa no, we made it
Left each other on the way to another love
Looks like we made it
Or I thought so till today
Until you were there, everywhere
And all I could taste was love the way we made it
Oh, we made it

Looks like we made it
Left each other on the way to another love

Smell those shrimp

To play a disco song so the ladies will dance
Slow dancin oh how shy they can get
Chicks don't like dancin too close to
Some new dude they just met
Cause when yuou dance slow there's nothin to say
And if he comes on strong she can't get away
Somebody play some rock and roll
So I can shake and bake some sweet woman's soul
I'm lady lookin but I can't get cooking
With slow dancin, dancin

Slow dancin, it don't turn me on

If all the moving parts are put together so well
Somebody please tell the record man

Lose all their meaning with the rising moon
Hold me and tell me that the words you say are true
Answer the question I must ask of you .....

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else

Take all the freedom that a lover will allow
If you feel the feeling that I'm feeling now
Where love goes, a fool knows that the hurt can go as deep
Don't make a promise that you cannot keep

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else

If you wanna get close to me
You could do it so easily
Is it love that I see when I look in your eyes
Or just another empty lie?

Do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
I guarantee it will bring you down
If you try and fool yourself
Well, do you wanna make love
Or do you just want to fool around?
You can take it seriously
Or take it somewhere else"

Way on the other side of the Hudson
Deep in the bosom of suburbia
I met a young girl
She sang mighty fine
Tears on my pillow and Ave Maria

Standing by the waterfall in Paramus Park
She was working for the friends of BAI
She was collecting quarters in a paper cup
She was looking for change
And so was I

She was a Jewish girl
I fell in love with her
She wrote her number on the back of my hand
I called her up
I was all out of breath
I said
""Come hear me play in my rock and roll band""

I took a shower
And I put on my best blue jeans
I picked her up in my new VW van
She wore a peasant blouse with nothing underneath
I said ""Hi""
She said, ""Yeah, I guess I am""

Ariel

[Verse 2:]
We had a little time
We were real hungry
We went to Dairy Queen for something to eat
She had some onion rings
She had a pickle
She forgot to tell me how she didn't eat meat

I had a gig in the American Legion hall
It was a dance for the Volunteer Ambulance Corps
She was sitting in a corner against the wall
She would smile
And I melted all over the floor

Annette Funicello and some guy going steady

While channel two was signing off the air
I found the softness of a mouth
We made love
The bombs bursting in air

In a wishful memory

I could make myself go back until the day I was born
And I would live my life again
And rearrange it so that I'd be yours from now on

Although tomorrow I know the sun is rising
Lighting up the world for everyone but not for me

Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

I used to watch 'em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street
Down on mainstreet
Down on mainstreet

I drift back in time and I find my feet

Watch closely now
Are you watching me now?
I'm the master magician
Who's setting you free
From the lies you've been told
When they're breaking your back
Bring your last straw to me
I turn straw into gold
I'm gonna need you later
When you're not around
But I can take it
Don't look down

Watch closely now...
Are you watching me now?"
552,1977,10cc,People In Love,"People in love do funny things
Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night
Look at the smile in her eyes
I knew I was right in my bones
I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes
Am I right, am I wrong
She's given me butterflies all along

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go

People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell us it's time to go"
553,1977,David Soul,Going In With My Eyes Open,"You smiled that misty way and something in my said
Remember the last time
Don't fall in love

I walked so blindly in
I fell and hurt my head
Oh I can't forget it
And I won't regret it
I couldn't even stop it if I tried

Only this time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time Ill see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way

It'd be so nice to love
Don't let it end the same
If you get uneasy just let me know
Don't lie or call me by somebody else's name
Oh I couldn't take it
I know it would break it
And I wanna give you
Everything I am

Only this time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time I'll see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way

This time I'm going in with my eyes open
I won't make the same mistakes again
This time I'll see the signs and no hearts broken
Won't be so blind and lose my way"

Quarter moon walking through the Milky Way
Oh, you and me, baby
We could think of something to do

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above

For making love

No use talking when the shadows fall
Nightbird's calling and he says it all
Oh, you and me, baby
We could think of something to do

It's the right time of the night
The stars are winking above
It's the right time of the night
For making love

We'll be bad, if you don't mind

556,1977,Bay City Rollers,You Made Me Believe In Magic,"I believed all love has gone
I've no strength to carry on
Thought my world was upside down

Then you walked on to my life
Went to work to set things right
What's the secret that you use

You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my life

Now I'm filled with new sense to be
You gave my life harmony
Loving you is all I need

You made me believe in magic
You know that I can be true to your love
You made me believe in magic
Your love's put magic into my life"
557,1977,Jackson Browne,The Pretender,"[Verse 1]
I'm going to rent myself a house
In the shade of the freeway
I'm going to pack my lunch in the morning
And go to work each day
And when the evening rolls around
I'll go on home and lay my body down

[Chorus]
And when the morning light
Comes streaming in
I'll get up and do it again
Amen
Say it again
Amen

[Verse 2]
I want to know what became of the changes
We waited for love to bring
Were they only the fitful dreams
Of some greater awakening?
I've been aware of the time going by
They say in the end it's the wink of an eye

[Chorus]
And when the morning light
Comes streaming in
You'll get up and do it again
Amen

[Verse 3]
Caught between the longing for love
And the struggle for the legal tender
Where the sirens sing
And the church bells ring
And the junk man pounds his fender
Where the veterans dream of the fight
Fast asleep at the traffic light
And the children solemnly wait
For the ice cream vendor

[Verse 4]
Out into the cool of the evening
Strolls the Pretender
He knows that all his hopes and dreams
Begin and end there

[Verse 5]
Ah the laughter of the lovers
As they run through the night
Leaving nothing for the others
But to choose off and fight
And tear at the world with all their might
While the ships bearing their dreams
Sail out of sight

[Verse 6]
I'm going to find myself a girl
Who can show me what laughter means
And we'll fill in the missing colors
In each other's paint-by-number dreams
And then we'll put our dark glasses on
And we'll make love until our strength is gone

[Chorus]
And when the morning light
Comes streaming in
We'll get up and do it again
Get it up again

[Verse 7]
I'm gonna be a happy idiot
And struggle for the legal tender
Where the ads take aim and lay their claim
To the heart and the soul of the spender
And believe in whatever may lie
In those things that money can buy
Though true love could have been a contender

[Bridge]
Are you there?
Say a prayer for the Pretender
Who started out so young and strong
Only to surrender

[Outro]
Say a prayer
For the pretender
Are you there
For the pretender?
Say a prayer
For the pretender
Oh, are you there
For the pretender?
Are you prepared
For the pretender?"
558,1977,Al Stewart,On The Border,"[Chorus]
The fishing boats go out across the evening water
Smuggling guns and arms across the Spanish border
The wind whips up the waves so loud
The ghost moon sails among the clouds
Turns the rifles into silver on the border

[Verse 1]
On my wall the colours of the maps are running
From Africa the winds they talk of changes coming
The torches flare up in the night
The hand that sets the farms alight
Has spread the word to those who're waiting on the border

[Verse 2]
In the village where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
Still you never see the change from day to day
And no-one notices the customs slip away

[Verse 3]
Late last night the rain was knocking at my window
I moved across the darkened room and in the lampglow
I thought I saw down in the street
The spirit of the century
Telling us that we're all standing on the border

[Verse 4]
In the islands where I grew up
Nothing seems the same
It's just the patterns that remain
An empty shell
But there's a strangeness in the air you feel too well

[Chorus]

[Outro]
On the border
On the border
On the border"
559,1977,Heart,Barracuda,"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
So this ain't the end, I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
Smile like the sun, kisses for everyone
And tales, it never fails!

[Chorus]
You lying so low into the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down, down, down, down on my knees
Now won't you, Barracuda?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Back over time, we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right, no wrong, you're selling a song, a name
Whisper game

[Chorus]
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn to the wick
Ooh, Barracuda

[Bridge]
""Sell me sell you"" the porpoise said
Dive down deep to save my head
I think that you got the blues, too

All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly, silly fools!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
If the real thing don't do the trick, no
You better make up something quick
You gonna burn, burn, burn, burn, burn it to the wick

Oh, Bara-Barracuda

560,1977,"Crosby, Stills & Nash",Just A Song Before I Go,"[Intro]
Just a song before I go
To whom it may concern
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned

[Verse 1]
When the shows were over
We had to get back home
And when we opened up the door
I had to be alone

[Verse 2]
She helped me with my suitcase
She stands before my eyes
Driving me to the airport
And to the friendly skies

[Verse 3]
Going through security
I held her for so long
She finally looked at me in love
And she was gone

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Just a song before I go
A lesson to be learned
Traveling twice the speed of sound
It's easy to get burned"
561,1977,Neil Sedaka,Amarillo,"When the day is dawning
On a Texas Sunday morning
How I long to be there
With Marie who's waitin' for me there
Every lonely city
Where I hang my hat
Ain't as half as pretty
As where my baby's at

Is this the way to Amarillo?
Every night I've been hugging my pillow
Dreaming dreams of Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me
Show me the way to Amarillo
I've been weepin' like a willow
Crying over Amarillo
And sweet Marie who waits for me

Sha la la la la la la la
And Marie who waits for me

There's a church bell ringing
Hear the sound of joy that it's singing
For the sweet Maria
And the guy who's comin' to see her
Just beyond the highway
Lies an open plain
And it keeps me going
Through the wind and rain

Is this the way to Amarillo?..."

A high time or two
I remember those
Neon nites with you

Give me some high trotting

Those oogie boogie
Honky tonky songs

You wore your silver stockings
We danced 'til dawn
Hootchie cootchie

Hard rocking all night long

Now the dance of bright lights
Make me blue

573,1977,Meri Wilson,Telephone Man,"I rented my apartment
On a Monday at one
A-singin' do lolly, lolly
Shicky bum, shicky bum

Started movin' in it
On a Tuesday at two
A-singin' do lolly, lolly
Shicky do, shicky do

Wednesday at three
I called the phone company, singin'
Hey baby, put a phone in for me

Thursday at four
He came a-knockin' at my door, singin'

Hey, baby, I'm your telephone man
You just show me where you want it
And I'll put it where I can
I can put it in the bedroom
I can put it in the hall
I can put it in the bathroom
I can hang it on the wall

You can have it with the buzz
You can have it with the ring
And if you really want it
You can have a ding-a-ling
Because-a hey baby
I'm your telephone man

Can you believe that?
And then he says
Now when other fellas call ya
Tell 'em how it all began
Well, can you imagine?

My heart began a-thumpin'
And my mind began to fly
And I knew I wasn't dealin'
With no ordinary guy

So while he was a-talking
I was thinkin' up my plan
Then my fingers did the walkin'
On the telephone man

Singin hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Get it any way you can
Right? Ha, ha, ha, so

I got it in the bedroom
And I got it in the hall
And I got it in the bathroom
And he hung it on the wall

I got it with a buzz
And I got it with a ring
And when he told me
What my number was
I got a ding-a-ling

A-singin hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Hey lolly, lolly
Just-a doin' my thing

Ha, ha...I've never done anything
Like this before"

Old friend of mine
We walked and we talked an' shared
A bottle of wine
We started to dance
My intentions were good
How could I know I'd be misunderstood

I promised to call before the weekend
Was thru
We'd all get together so she could
Meet you
I was just being friendly, I met her
By chance
You gotta believe me - it's not a romance

Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light

You gotta see it from my point
Of view
The same situation could
Happen to you
I said it was over before she left
Town
I can't believe that you're putting me down

Aaahh, It would be easy if you'd lighten up
Do it to please me, enough is enough
All that we've been thru, how can you doubt
The ups an' the downs are what loving's about

Don't turn the light out, I'm starting to see
Don't turn the light out, you're getting to me
Don't turn the light out, we're burning so bright
Don't turn the light out..... Don't turn out the light

Mmm, don't turn the light out
Ooohhh, don't turn the light out

The morning's over
The bed is soft and warm
Where we lay

I've dreamed the whole night through
Of how I'd say to you
All the things
My heart wants to say

Last night
You heard me crying
'Cause I had never loved a man
Before

And I guess the tears were falling
'Cause the little girl was lost
But now love
I'm not crying any more

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life

This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness
Last night

I've never a man
Lying on my pillow
I've never seen your body
Without clothes

I can't believe
These feelings I've discovered
Though I'm sure it's just
What every lover knows

Now I'm offering to you
I make a promise
And? Was gone tomorrow
Don't pretend

But right now I'm in love
And that's all I'm thinking of
And I hope this feeling
Never ever ends

This girl has turned into a woman
And I've dreamed of this moment
All my life
This girl has turned into a woman
And I thank you
For your tenderness last night

And I want to love you
Once again

I need a man, to make my dreams come true

Say that you will find him
Creeping up behind him
Rulin' round' the town all day

Well, I'm underestimated
Hardly underrated
Can't there be another way?

I need a man, perhaps a man like you
I need a man, to make my dreams and I need a man

All that I'm feelin' deep inside me
Knowing that at last he's come

Wastin' all my cookin
Ending in a dreadful rile

Can somebody tell me
Say to me, or spell me
Why I'm feelin' lonely, wow! ow

I need a man to make my dreams
And I need a man

And then at night I won't be lonely
Knowing I'm the only one

He'll understand
All, that I'm feelin' deep inside me
Knowing that at last he's come

Maybe that I'm dreaming
Can't say they I've seen him
Somehow, I've just got to find

Someone understanding
Long enough to hand him
All that I've built up inside, the man!

Perhaps that man is you!"

I dreamed that you would never believe in me

You said that you would always believe in me

My dream was gone like darkness from the sky
Felt the pain and I saw the truth...
Only the lucky in love survive

Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, you're just half alive
Only the lucky in love survive
Without love, I'd just as soon die

I gave my love and I gave my best
God only knows how good it felt to try
In the end, I'm alone again...

'Cause only the lucky in love survive

Without love, you're just half alive
Only the lucky in love survive

How can I hold you when you ain't even mine?
Only you can see me through

Sorry that it had to end this way
No reason to pretend
We knew it had to end some day, this way

Guess, it's over, the kicks are gone
What's the use of tryin' to hang on?
Somewhere we lost the key
So little left for you and me and it's clear to see

Too much, too little, too late to lie again with you
Too much, too little, too late to try again with you
We're in the middle of ending something that we do
It's all over
Oh, it was over

Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end
And it's over
It's over

Guess it's over, the chips are down
Nearly all our bridges tumbled down
Whatever chance we try, let's face it, why deny
It's over
It's all over
It's over

Too much, too little, too late to ever try again
Too much, too little, too late, let's end it being friends
Too much, too little, too late, we knew it had to end
And it's over

[Verse 1]
Windin' your way down on Baker Street
Light in your head and dead on your feet
Well another crazy day, you'll drink the night away
And forget about everything
This city desert makes you feel so cold
It's got so many people but it's got no soul
And it's taking you so long to find out you were wrong
When you thought it held everything

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to think that it was so easy
You used to say that it was so easy
But you're tryin', you're tryin' now
Another year and then you'll be happy
Just one more year and then you'll be happy
But you're cryin', you're cryin' now

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Way down the street there's a light in his place
He opens the door he's got that look on his face
And he asks you where you've been
You tell him who you've seen and you talk about anything
He's got this dream about buyin' some land
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands
And then he'll settle down, in some quiet little town
And forget about everything

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know he'll always keep movin'
You know he's never gonna stop movin'
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rollin' stone
And when you wake up, it's a new mornin'
The sun is shinin', it's a new mornin'
You're goin', you're goin' home

Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break
Then he lets you down

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

It's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down

It's a fool's game
Nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown

It ain't right with love to share
When you find he doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you

Oh, it's a heartache
Nothing but a heartache
Love him till your arms break

606,1978,George Benson,On Broadway,"They say the neon lights are bright on Broadway
They say there's always magic in the air
But when you're walking down that street
And you ain't had enough to eat
The glitter rubs right off and you're nowhere

They say the women treat you right on Broadway
But looking at them just gives me the blues
'Cause how you gonna make some time
When all you got is one thin dime
And one thin dime won't even shine your shoes

They say I won't last too long on Broadway
I'll catch a Greyhound bus for home, they all say
But they're dead wrong, I know they are
'Cause I can play this guitar
And I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway

I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway
No, no, no, no
I won't quit til I'm a star on Broadway

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

My Ma she used to say
Beware the tender trap
If you get caught in one
Be sure you notice where your heart is at
Don't take chances with things
Things like that, oh, oh

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love
Baby, this time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
But how could I possibly lose
How could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love
This time I'm in it to win
It's crazy to do it again
Crazy, baby
But how could I possibly lose
Ain't no way I could I lose
This time I'm in it for you

This time I'm in it for love"

Time on my side

Some things are better left unsaid
I'm gonna spend my days in bed
I'll walk the streets at night
To be hidden by the city lights, city lights

Love is like oxygen

613,1978,Roberta Flack With Donny Hathaway,The Closer I Get To You,"[Verse 1: Masta Ace]
I was raised to the sound of the 70's
Earth, wind and fire, sounded so heavenly
Ohio players and Curtis Mayfield
Aretha Franklin's picture on a playbill
Al Green in a tight suit, all white
Minnie Riperton high notes, all night
Mom's even had a box full of 45's
Put the needle down, yea that sounds sorta live
Sound like the kind of groove I could rap over
Got drunk off the beat then I was back sober
Bring that part back, yea I'mma murder that
Donny Hat on the track with Roberta Flack

[Bridge]
Hide records
In the bag
Sneak them out before she notice that they gone
Gotta think
I don't know
Should I rap of my mom's favorite song?

[Verse 2: Masta Ace]
Better hope I don't scratch it, or that's it
I'mma get my ass kicked, that's a classic
Can't explain that I was just borrowing it
Moms on a rampage lookin' for her Parliament
And Donny Hathaway feelin like a cast'away
Hiding in grandmom's room more than half the day
If I told her that her Parliament at brian crib
And nobody home now, I'mma be a crying kid
But it's seeming like I'm safe for the time being
My uncle gettin all the blame far as I'm seeing
I just gotta lay low like a snake belly
It's a sticky situation like grape jelly
I'm on the titanic, or some other boat
Got my mother and her brother at each others throat

[Bridge]
You better hope mommy never find out
Cause if she does then that's your ass
You know damn well if you touch one
And you get caught that'll be your ass

Ninteen-Seventy Something
And the year is..
Ninteen-seventy Something

[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
The final act, Brian's at the door
With a black and red nap sack
Came to bring the vinyl back
I put it back before anybody notices
He said ""close call"" I said ""yea I know this is""
But I got away with it like the perfect crime
And made the fresh tape, man it was worth the time
An aggravation and stress almost made a mess
She'd a found out it's me she would of laid to rest
But I'm over like a fat rat
That was smart it's a good thing you hid 'em in that backpack
It feels so good to get that out the way
Now I'm out the door, back out to play
I'm about to say these are the good time like Chic
And then I hear my mom shriek

[Outro]
Duval
Get back in here, (uh-oh)
How did my record get scratched
I know you did it
Go get my belt
C'mon ma'
That's it get my belt, now
C'mon ma'"

615,1978,Carly Simon,You Belong To Me,"Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know
Don't you know I'll always be your girl

You don't have to prove to me you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes
Of my own

You belong to me

You belong to me
(You don't even know her)
You belong to me
(Tell her that I love you)
You belong to me

You belong to me
Can it be, honey, that you're not sure

You belong to me
Thought we'd closed the book
Locked the door

You don't have to prove to me that you're beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell darling

You belong to me

616,1978,Meat Loaf,Two Out Of Three Ain't Bad,"[Verse 1]
Baby, we can talk all night
But that ain't getting us nowhere
I told you everything I possibly can
There's nothing left inside of here
And maybe you can cry all night
But that'll never change the way that I feel
The snow is really piling up outside
I wish you wouldn't make me leave here

[Verse 2]
I poured it on and I poured it out
I tried to show you just how much I care
I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
But you've been cold to me so long
I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
And all I can do is keep on tellin' you

[Chorus]
I want you, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad, (Don't be sad cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, (Cause)
Cause two out of three ain't bad

[Bridge]
You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin'
At the bottom of a Cracker Jack box

I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not
No matter how I try, I'll never be able
To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got

[Verse 3]
Well, there's only one girl that I will ever love
And that was so many years ago
And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
She never loved me back, ooh I know
Well, I remember how she left me on a stormy night
Oh, she kissed me and got out of our bed
And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
She packed her bags and turned right away
And she kept on tellin' me
She kept on tellin' me
She kept on tellin' me

[Chorus]
I want you, oh, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad, cause two out of three ain't bad

I want you, I need you
But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
Now don't be sad
Cause two out of three ain't bad
Now don't be sad, cause two out of three ain't bad

617,1978,Patti Smith Group,Because The Night,"[Verse 1]
Take me now, baby, here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

[Verse 2]
Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us

[Bridge]
With love we sleep
With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

[Chorus]
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us
Because tonight there are two lovers
If we believe in the night we trust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because tonight belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust"
618,1978,Steely Dan,Deacon Blues,"[Verse 1]
This is the day
Of the expanding man
That shape is my shade
There where I used to stand
It seems like only yesterday
I gazed through the glass
At ramblers, wild gamblers
That's all in the past

[Verse 2]
You call me a fool
You say it's a crazy scheme
This one's for real
I already bought the dream
So useless to ask me why
Throw a kiss and say goodbye
I'll make it this time
I'm ready to cross that fine line

[Chorus]
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

[Verse 3]
My back to the wall
A victim of laughing chance
This is for me
The essence of true romance
Sharing the things we know and love
With those of my kind
Libations, sensations
That stagger the mind

[Verse 4]
I crawl like a viper
Through these suburban streets
Make love to these women
Languid and bittersweet
I'll rise when the sun goes down
Cover every game in town
A world of my own
I'll make it my home sweet home

[Chorus]
Learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

[Instrumental break 3:50-4:52]

[Verse 5]
This is the night
Of the expanding man
I take one last drag
As I approach the stand
I cried when I wrote this song
Sue me if I play too long
This brother is free
I'll be what I want to be

[Chorus]
I'll learn to work the saxophone
I, I'll play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whisky all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I, I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues (Deacon Blues)

If a nigga take my life, I pray he see me smilin', boss

625,1978,Michael Johnson,Bluer Than Blue,"After you go, I can catch up on my reading
After you go, I'll have a lot more time for sleeping
And when you're gone, looks like things are gonna be a lot easier
Life will be a breeze, you know
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

After you go, I'll have a lot more room in my closet
After you go, I'll stay out all night long if I feel like it
And when you're gone I can run through the house screaming
And no one will ever hear me
I really should be glad

But I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue

I don't have to miss no TV shows
I can start my whole life over
Change the numbers on my telephone
But the nights will sure be colder

And I'm bluer than blue, sadder than sad
You're the only light this empty room has ever had
Life without you is gonna be
Bluer than blue
Bluer than blue

627,1978,Barry Manilow,Even Now,"Even now, when there's someone else who cares
When there's someone home who's waiting just for me
Even now I think about you as I'm climbing up the stairs
And I wonder what to do so she won't see

That even now, when I know it wasn't right
And I found a better life than what we had
Even now I wake up crying in the middle of the night
And I can't believe it still could hurt so bad

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And how I wish you knew
Even now

Even now, when I never hear your name
And the world has changed so much since you've been gone
Even now I still remember and the feeling's still the same
And this pain inside of me goes on and on
Even now

Even now, when I have come so far
I wonder where you are
I wonder why it's still so hard without you
Even now, when I come shinin' through
I swear I think of you
And God I wish you knew
Somehow
Even now"

Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me

Go crazy is what I will do

632,1978,Jimmy Buffett,Cheeseburger In Paradise,"[Verse 1]
Tried to amend my carnivorous habits
Made it nearly seventy days
Losin' weight without speed, eatin' sunflower seeds
Drinkin' lots of carrot juice and soakin' up rays
But at night I'd have these wonderful dreams
Some kind of sensuous treat
Not zucchini, fettuccini, or bulgur wheat
But a big warm bun and a huge hunk of meat

[Chorus 1]
Cheeseburger in paradise
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
Not too particular, not too precise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

[Verse 2]
Heard about the old time sailor men
They eat the same thing again and again
Warm beer and bread they say could raise the dead
Well, it reminds me of the menu at a Holiday Inn
But times have changed for sailors these days
When I'm in port I get what I need
Not just Havanas or bananas or daiquiris
But that American creation on which I feed

[Chorus 2]
Cheeseburger in paradise
Medium rare with Muenster'd be nice
Heaven on earth with an onion slice
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

[Bridge]
I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god Almighty which way do I steer?

[Chorus 3]
For my cheeseburger in paradise
Makin' the best of every virtue and vice
Worth every damn bit of sacrifice
To get a cheeseburger in paradise;
To be a cheeseburger in paradise
I'm just a cheeseburger in paradise

[Bridge]
I like mine with lettuce and tomato
Heinz 57 and french fried potatoes
Big kosher pickle and a cold draft beer
Well, good god Almighty which way do I steer?"
633,1978,Rod Stewart,I Was Only Joking,"[Verse 1]
Ever since I was a kid in school
I messed around with all the rules
Apologized, then realized
I'm not different after all

Me and the boys thought we had it sussed
Valentinos all of us
My dad said we looked ridiculous
But, boy, we broke some hearts

In and out of jobs, running free
Waging war with society
Dumb, blank faces stared back at me
But nothing ever changed

Promises made in the heat of night
Creepin' home before it got too light
I wasted all that precious time
And blamed it on the wine

[Chorus]
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win

[Verse 2]
Never found a compromise
Collected lovers like butterflies
Illusions of that grand first prize
Are slowly wearin' thin

Susie, baby, you were good to me
Giving love unselfishly
But you took it all too seriously
I guess it had to end

[Chorus]
I was only joking, my dear
Looking for a way to hide my fear
What kind of fool was I?
I could never win
Yeah, baby, woo

[Verse 3]
Now you ask me if I'm sincere
That's the question that I always fear
Verse seven is never clear
But I'll tell you what you want to hear

I try to give you all you want
But giving love is not my strongest point
If that's the case, it's pointless going on
I'd rather be alone

'Cause what I'm doing must be wrong
Pouring my heart out in a song
Owning up for prosperity
For the whole damn world to see

Quietly now while I turn a page
Act one is over without costume change
The principal would like to leave the stage
The crowd don't understand"
634,1978,Genesis,Follow You Follow Me,"[Verse 1]
Stay with me
My love, I hope you'll always be
Right here by my side if ever I need you
Oh, my love

In your arms
I feel so safe and so secure
And every day is such a perfect day to spend
Alone with you

[Chorus 1]
I will follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year

[Verse 2]
With the dark
Oh, I see so very clearly now
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now
Fading away

I can say
The night is long, but you are here
Close at hand, oh, I'm better for the smile you give
And while I live I will

[Chorus 2]
Follow you, will you
Follow me all the days and nights that we
Know will be I will
Stay with you will you
Stay with me just one
Single tear in each
Passing year there will be

[Chorus 3 with repeats]
I will follow you will you
Follow me All the
Days and nights that we
Know will be I will

Passing year I will

Follow you, will you
Follow me all the
Days and nights that we
Know will be, I will
Stay with you, will you
Stay with me, just one
Single tear in each
Passing year, I will

Follow you, will you

""Hey, what's the matter, man?

Sometimes I say

It comes down to fate

Well, they showed you a statue
Told you to pray
They built you a temple
And locked you away
Aw, but they never told you
The price that you pay
For things that you might have done

Well, only the good die young
That's what I said
Only the good die young
Only the good die young

I run with a dangerous crowd

We might be laughing a bit too loud

Send up a signal, I'll throw you the line

You're hiding behind
Never lets in the sun

I saw my problems, and I'll see the light
We got a lovin' thing, we gotta feed it right
There ain't no danger, we can go too far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are
Grease is the word

They think our love is just a growin' pain
Why don't they understand? It's just a cryin' shame
Their lips are lyin', only real is real
We stop the fight right now, we got to be what we feel
Grease is the word

Grease is the word, is the word that you heard
It's got a groove, it's got a meaning
Grease is the time, is the place, is the motion
Grease is the way we are feeling

Conventionality belongs to yesterday
There is a chance that we can make it so far
We start believin' now that we can be who we are

Laced with confusion - what're we doin' here?

Warmer than sunshine, baby
Sweeter than tears
That's how my life has been
Since you first appeared

You opened up my heart
To everything fine
You put a light inside me
And you made me shine

From the time I met you
Everything came true
All I ever dreamed
I found in you

Ooh, you got it
There's no way
I'm gonna live without it
Nothing can stop it
I'm all yours
Cause baby you got it all

[Verse 2:]
You keep me moving, baby
To the beat of your drum
I love what you're doing
And where you're coming from

And when you hold me, baby
It's like we are one
Cause you got a motion
That gets me all undone

When you took my life
And turned it all around
Ooh
You got me flying
Don't take me down

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
You know I can't control
For what I feel in my soul
My heart is full of you
All I wanna do is to love you
Love you the rest of my life

Don't stop now
Spread your love around me
Do it now
Do it now

But like a honey bee stings
You've gone and left my heart in pain
All you left is our favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
It used to bring sweet memories
Of a tender love that used to be

Now it's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

A sentimental fool am I
To hear a old love song
And wanna cry
But the melody keeps haunting me
Reminding me how in love we used to be
Keep hearing the part that used to touch my heart
Saying together forever
Breaking up never

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

Precious memories keep a lingering on
Everytime I hear our favorite song
Now you're gone
Left this emptiness
I only reminisce
The happiness we spent
We used to dance on the music
Make romance through the music

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone
It's the same old song
But with a different meaning
Since you been gone

It's the same old song
But with a different meaning

Wind tearin' through the backstreet, I hear the rhythm of my heart beat
Rain blowin' to my face, I'm tired of being in the wrong place

Blues knockin' on my back door, I can't jump from the second floor
Turn up the radio higher and higher, rock and roll music set my ears on fire

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through

Laid off work and I can't be free, I need some rock 'n' roll therapy
Put on a 45 and let the needle ride, jukebox jumps and I'll be satisfied

When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through

Oh, let me ride on your mystery train, ride through the night in the pourin' rain
Rock and roll in my soul, got me losin' control, let it roll!

Stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through
When I was stone blue, rock and roll sure helped me through

How I could ever let you go
There's not a lot of change in my life
But one thing that I know

If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it'll work out alright
Maybe this time we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again

Warm sleepy morning waking up next to you
Feeling you close by my side
Nothing on earth has ever felt better
Then the feelings I've felt deep inside
Sometimes it seems that I never lost you
And that you're not really gone
'Cause I had this dream
This wonderful dream
It just goes on and on

If ever I see you again
Maybe this time it'll work out alright
Maybe this time we won't say goodbye but only goodnight
With a love that won't end
If ever I see you again"

With the sun never shining on me
Sad and lonely but then when she came
She was all that I wanted to see

I want you to be mine
All I need is the words and the rhyme
I want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way
The image I see
Is that really me
To need you more each and every day?

She was looking like handwoven dreams
In her eyes I saw oceans of pearls
There she was, I felt lost it seemed
I could only be thinking of her

Want you to be mine
All I need is a little more time
Want you to be mine

Still I wonder how some things can suddenly change
And yet stay the same
I could never have thought life would lead me this way
The image I see
Is that really me
To need you more each and every day?"

With yellow feathers in her hair and a dress cut down to there
She would merengue and do the cha-cha
And while she tried to be a star
Tony always tended bar
Across the crowded floor, they worked from 8 'til 4
They were young and they had each other
Who could ask for more?

[Chorus]
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion

At the copa… they fell in love

His name was Rico
He wore a diamond
He was escorted to his chair, he saw Lola dancing there
And when she finished, he called her over
But Rico went a bit too far
Tony sailed across the bar
And then the punches flew and chairs were smashed in two
There was blood and a single gun shot
But just who shot who?

[Chorus]
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)
The hottest spot north of Havana (here)
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana
Music and passion were always the fashion

At the copa... she lost her love

Her name is Lola, she was a showgirl
But that was 30 years ago, when they used to have a show
Now it's a disco, but not for Lola
Still in the dress she used to wear
Faded feathers in her hair
She sits there so refined, and drinks herself half-blind
She lost her youth and she lost her Tony
Now she's lost her mind

[Chorus]
At the copa (CO!) Copacabana (Copacabana)

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sighs?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun?

I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow?
Will you still love me tomorrow?"

Till the end of the time (baby baby)
And we were the lovers who once could show the others
How a poem should rhyme (oh didn't we baby)
That love has faded from your touch somehow
It seems one-sided to me now, I beg you

Babe lets bring back that once in a lifetime
When we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
And kissed in the sun
Lets try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, lets fly
Don't say goodbye
Don't let our love just die

And though I'm so near you I'm living in the fear
You will leave soon (baby baby)
And we sang the chorus that love had written for us
But we fell out of tune (oh didn't we baby)
No doubt this broken heart will never mend
You know I'll love you to the end, I beg you

Babe lets bring back that once in a lifetime
When we were the ones who took a ride on a rainbow
And kissed in the sun
Lets try to bring back the time when we had stars in our eyes
Hey babe, this once in a lifetime, lets fly

Don't say goodbye
Don't let our love just die
Bring back the love of yesterday
That somehow got away
Cause baby I love you
You know that I love you"

Let the roadies take the stage
Pack it up and tear it down
They're the first to come and last to leave
Working for that minimum wage
They'll set it up in another town
Tonight the people were so fine
They waited there in line
And when they got up on their feet they made the show
And that was sweet ...
But I can hear the sound
Of slamming doors and folding chairs
And that's a sound they'll never know

Now roll them cases out and lift them amps
Haul them trusses down and get'em up them ramps
Cause when it comes to moving me
You guys are the champs
But when that last guitar's been packed away
You know that I still want to play
So just make sure you got it all set to go
Before you come for my piano

[Steel Guitar Solo: David Lindley]

But the band's on the bus
And they're waiting to go
We've got to drive all night and do a show in Chicago
Or Detroit, I don't know
We do so many shows in a row
And these towns all look the same
We just pass the time in our hotel rooms
And wander 'round backstage
Till those lights come up and we hear that crowd
And we remember why we came

Now we got country and western on the bus, R&B
We got disco on eight tracks and cassettes in stereo
We got rural scenes and magazines
And we got truckers on CB
And we got Richard Pryor on the video

We got time to think of the ones we love
While the miles roll away
But the only time that seems too short
Is the time that we get to play

People you've got the power over what we do
You can sit there and wait
Or you can pull us through
Come along, sing the song
You know you can't go wrong
Cause when that morning sun comes beating down
You're going to wake up in your town
But we'll be scheduled to appear
A thousand miles away from here

People stay just a little bit longer
We want to play -- just a little bit longer
Now the promoter don't mind
And the union don't mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song--
Oh, won't you stay just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, say you will
Say you will

Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer
Oh won’t you stay
Just a little bit longer

And the promoter don’t mind

To the end of the road and back
Me and my friend came in
Shit get's odd when you livin' in sin
Knockin' at the back door and not gettin' in
I'm a ragin' buffalo black
Whirlwind rider, leather saddle, ready for battlin' any instinct
Brought myself to an infant
So I can leave that proper imprint
Imprint is so fly
So different and so shy
Everybody gifted but so dry
I'm tryin' to bring that rain to roll
That thought to get you by
We high off life in the best way
Transitioning over the airwaves, right in front of your eyes
We best play over two fifteens or essays
Grow within you things that press play
My dunes been cocooned and now breath throughout my resume
Reservoir dog barkin' in the back lot
Tryin' to get unchained and hop the fence
Like that chain of command to get to that higher plain of consciousness
Consequence of stagnation
Sittin', rot in damnation
What is a man without some change
Bummin' the street with himself to blame
Empty pockets, empty brain
I'm sick with God my Midi mane
Forever eyes so simple plain

[Hook] [x2]
A simple plan for life is change
Find yourself the nicest frame
Strange
Then you see the light, man
Then you find the right, lane
On a bright, day

[Verse Two] [The Grouch]
And as I write to this tune
My babies five months growin' in the womb
There's a population boom goin' on
There's a planetary shift you can hear it in this song
They try to heal it then cut it
Heal it then cut it
Heal it then cut it
Don't cut it again
If you feel it then love it
If you feel it then love it
If you feel it, love it my friend
It's right in front of us
Each and every one of us
Freedom or death, yes the two are antonymous
Symphonic just hearin' good news
I keep my ears open and stare to the moon
I know there's more than hope when I put out the feelers
We all want the same things, when we're bein' our realest
Collective consciousness, let's form a village
Then spread good feelings till there ain't no more killers
And I apologize if I didn't always rise
To occasion
Had to come of age and apply
My knowledge to my personal experiences
If I didn't I could have died in all seriousness
We've come far y'all
As a person as a people as a world
It's time to raise the bar
It's not hard just remember who you are
It's not just remember, remember

Nobody's sure he was sane

The nature of what we are

Which no one's unraveled today

A glimpse of the master plan
He could see into the future
A true visionary man

It died when he went away
If only he could have been with us
No telling what he might say

690,1978,LeBlanc & Carr,Midnight Light,"She was lonely
And no one really cared
Just a prisoner
Of a love that was unfair

She really wanted him
But he was never there
Now she's looking for a lover
For the lonely nights to share

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

First time lovers
It'll never be the same
I was losing
But still I played the game
She looked right through me
Like no one ever dared
She said meet me at midnight
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm scared

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

I feel so sorry when I hold her tight
Cause I know I'm holding a lover for one night

In the midnight light
Shining from her window
The loving light
Keeps me glowing inside
The midnight light
Brightens up the shadows

Keep the light on baby
Know I'm coming to love you
Coming to love you tonight baby
Oh baby
Yeah baby

How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time, oh, baby
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Flaming candle, hey, burning me with sweet desire
Icy cold, hard to handle, back and forth from ice to fire
You don't even know what you're putting me through
With all these bittersweet things that you do
How can you be daylight and darkness, at the same time, oh...
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Oh, baby, oh, baby

You don't even know what I'm talking about
It's just your way, baby, that's what you say
How can you be daylight and darkness at the same time
How can, how can you be daylight and darkness at the same time

Never stop to worry

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And I hardly know your name
And if I say I love you in the candlelight
There's no one but myself to blame
But there's something inside
That's turning my mind away
Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

[Chorus]
(It's late) When I'm bleeding deep inside
(It's late) Ooh, is it just my sickly pride?
(Too late) Even now
The feeling seems to steal away
(So late) Though I'm crying
I can't help but hear you say
It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

[Verse 2]
The way you love me
Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's

But I'll learn to be right

Tell me
Try to work it out, yeah
Woo! Ooh
Too late, yeah
Too late, much too late

You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

(It's late) Ooh, but it's time to set me free
(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be
(Too late) So let the fire
Take our bodies this night
(So late) Let the waters
Take our guilt in the tide, now

Baby, I can't figure it out
Your kisses taste like honey
Sweet lies don't gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you're trying to do?

Livin' on your cheatin'
And the pain grows inside me
It's enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you're
Driving me insane
And I'm hanging on
Oh, oh, I'll win, I'll never give in

Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
Ain't good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain't working right

I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out
I love no other way

What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
Lifetime ain't good for me
I figure it's the love that keeps you warm

Let this moment be forever
We won't ever feel the storm
I ain't no vision, I am the man
Who loves you inside and out
Backwards and forwards with
My heart hanging out

I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don't try to tell me it's all over
I can't hear a word I can't hear a line
No man could love you more
And that's what I'm cryin' for
You can't change the way I feel inside

You're the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
Between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die

Who loves you inside and out

My heart hanging out

He don't, uh, stutter when he talks
And it's true, it's true
He sure has acquired
This kind of cool and inspired sort of jazz when he walks
Where's his jacket and his old blue jeans?
If, if this ain't healthy, it is some kinda clean

[Chorus]
But that means that Chuck E.'s in love, my, my
Chuck E.'s in love, love, love, love
Chuck E.'s in love, uh-huh
Chuck E.'s in

[Bridge]
I don't believe what you're saying to me
This is something that I've got to see
Is he here?
I look in the pool hall
But is he here?
I look in the drugstore
But is he here?
No, he don't come here no more

[Verse 2]
Well, I tell you what
I saw him
He was sittin' behind us
Down at the Pantages
And whatever it is
That he's got up his sleeve
Well, I hope it isn't contagious
What's her name?
Is that her there?
Oh, Christ, I think he's even combed his hair
And is that her?
Well, then, what's her name?
Oh, it's never gonna be the same
That's not her
I know what's wrong
'Cause Chuck E.'s in love with the little girl singing this song
And don't you know

Chuck E.'s in love, yeah, yeah

709,1979,Kenny Rogers,She Believes In Me,"[Verse 1]
While she lays sleeping, I stay out late at night and play my songs
And sometimes all the nights can be so long
And it's good when I finally make it home, all alone
While she lays dreaming, I try to get undressed without the light
And quietly she says how was your night?
And I come to her and say, it was all right, and I hold her tight

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, find a way

[Verse 2]
While she lays waiting, I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Just waiting for me like a secret friend, and there's no end
While she lays crying, I fumble with a melody or two
And I'm torn between the things that I should do
And she says to wake her up when I am through
God her love is true

[Chorus]
And she believes in me, I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl, I could change the world
With my little songs, I was wrong
But she has faith in me, and so I go on trying faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night, if my song is right
I can find a way, while she waits while she waits for me"
710,1979,Olivia Newton-John,Deeper Than The Night,"I can't imagine why you say the things you do
Maybe in time I'll understand
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel
When I'm trying everything I can

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way

Can you hear me?
Am I really coming through?
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?
I know what's right for you, haven't I always?
I need you more than I can say

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
It's a fire burning bright
And it's always been this way

And I'll never ever change
In my lifetime, I'll stay the same
Yes, I'll never, I'll never change
I'll love you, I'll stay the same

My love is running deeper than the night
Stronger than the north wind blowing
Fire burning bright, and it keeps on growing
Keeps on growing"

I been scratched and taxed and finally axed

You're all alone in the freezing cold

You're acting chic, playing hide and seek

Deep down ain't we all a little juvenile
All I really wanna know is there one sweet angel

725,1979,England Dan & John Ford Coley,Love Is The Answer,"Name your price
A ticket to paradise
I can't stay here anymore

And I've looked high and low
I've been from shore to shore to shore
If there's a shortcut
I'd have found it
But there is no easy way around it

Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Who knows why someday
We all must die
We're all homeless boys and girls
And we are never heard

It's such a lonely, lonely, lonely world
People turn their heads
And walk on by
Tell me
Is it worth just another try

Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
(Let it shine)
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Tell me
Are we alive
Or just a dying planet?
(What are the chances?)
Ask the man in your heart
For the answer

And when you feel afraid
(Love one another)
When you've lost your way
(Love one another)

And when you're all alone
(Love one another)
And when you're far from home
(Love one another)

And when you're down and out
(Love one another)
And when your hopes run out
(Love one another)

And when you need a friend
(Love one another)
And when you're near the end
(Love, we got to love
We got to love one another)

Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer
Shine on us all
Set us free
Love is the answer

Light of the world
Shine on me
Love is the answer

Shine on us all
Set us free

But as long as I got you by my side
I don't care what my people say

I'll see you when I can

Knowing you got a wife
And two little children
Depending on you too

Am I wrong to hunger
For the gentleness of your touch
Knowing you got somebody else at home
Who needs you just as much

Am I wrong to give my love
To a married man
Am I wrong for trying to hold on
To the best thing I ever had

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you know it's hard
(You know it's hard, you know it gets so hard)
Everybody wants her, everybody loves her
Everybody wants to take your baby home

When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)
You know that is crazy and you wanna trust her
Then somebody hangs up when you answer the phone

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
Maybe it's just an ego problem, problem is that I've been fooled before
By fair-weather friends and faint-hearted lovers
And every time it happens it just convinces me more

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies
(Keep lookin' for lies, baby keep lookin' for eyes)
Cause everybody tempts her everybody tells her
She's the most beautiful woman they know

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you go it alone
When you're in love with a beautiful woman you watch your friends
(You watch your friends, you better watch your friends)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman it never ends
(Never ends, you know it never ends)

When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you watch her eyes
(Watch her eyes, baby watch her eyes)
When you're in love with a beautiful woman, you look for lies

It leaves someone to cry night and day
Like a bird, who left the robin's nest

You flew away

And I was just another fool (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
There ain't no easy way out (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
They're gonna shake you 'til you shout, hey, hey (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)

They treat you like a dog, but you're only human
You miss your home, Lord, you miss that woman

You can squeeze the sails, you can lick the decks""

It was a shakedown cruise (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
I guess I just was born to lose (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
They tell you life is going cheap (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)

(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right
(Starlight alone in the night)
(Drift away and it feels all right) And it feels all right

You know I'll never go to sea again""

And now we're sendin' out the news (Shakedown, shakin' out the blues)
There ain't no victory at sea (Shakedown, shakedown cruise)
Unless it's mutiny (Shakedown, shakin' in my shoes)

Now if I don't get off alive, it's just as well
I'll be waking up in heaven, 'cause I've been through hell
On this shakedown cruise
They call it a shakedown cruise
Aw, shake me down, boy

You're the one

Now you can change your telephone number
And you can change your address too
But you can't stop me from loving you
No, you can't change that

And you can't change that

You're the only one I need
And you can't change that

You're the only one I love
And you can't change that
(You may change a dollar bill)
You're the only one I need
(But let me tell you one thing)
And you can't change that
(You won't change the way I feel)

(You're the only one I love)
(And you can't change that)
I say my heart tells me how I feel
(You're the only one I need)
(And you can't change that)
It lets me know
It lets me know my love is real

(You're the only one I love)
No, you can't change that
You can't change my love girl
You're the only one I love
I need you, I love

742,1979,The Kinks,(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman,"Woke up this morning, started to sneeze
I had a cigarette and a cup of tea
I looked in the mirror what did I see
A nine stone weakling with knobbly knees

I did my knees bend, press ups, touch my toes
I had another sneeze and I blew my nose
I looked in the mirror at my pigeon chest
I had to put on my clothes because it made me depressed

Surely there must be a way
For me to change the shape I'm in
Dissatisfied is what I am
I want to be a better man

Superman, Superman, wish I could fly like Superman
Superman, Superman, I want to be like Superman
I want to be like Superman
Superman, Superman, wish I could fly like Superman

Woke up this morning, what did I see
A big black cloud hanging over me
I switched on the radio and nearly dropped dead
The news was so bad that I fell out of bed

There was a gas strike, oil strike, lorry strike, bread strike
Got to be a Superman to survive
Gas bills, rent bills, tax bills, phone bills
I'm such a wreck but I'm staying alive

(Woke up this morning, what do I see
Robbery, violence, insanity)

Hey girl, we've got to get out of this place
There's got to be something better than this
I need you, but I hate to see you this way
If I were Superman then we'd fly away

I'd really like to change the world
And save it from the mess it's in
I'm too weak, I'm so thin
I'd like to fly but I can't even swim

Superman, Superman, I want to fly like Superman
Superman, Superman, wish I could fly like Superman
Superman, Superman, wish I could fly like Superman
Superman, Superman, I want to be like Superman
Superman, Superman, I want to fly like Superman"
743,1979,Roxy Music,Dance Away,"Yesterday, when it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kiss goodnight
I said ""it's love"", you said ""alright""
Its funny how, I could never cry
Until tonight, when you pass by
Hand-in-Hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill, and guess whos dying...

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...

Loneliness, is a crowded room
Full of open hearts, turned to stone
All together, all alone
All at once, my whole world had changed
Now I'm in the dark, off the wall
Lit the strobe light up the wall
I close my eyes, and dance til dawn

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away...
Dance away...
Dance away...

Now I know, I must walk the line
Until i find an open door
Off the street or onto the floor
There was I, many times a fool
I hoped and prayed, but not too much
Out of reach is out of touch
All the way is far enough

Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away, fears"

If you search for tenderness
It isn't hard to find
You can have the love you need to live
But if you look for truthfulness
You might just as well be blind
It always seems to be so hard to give

[Chorus]
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Verse 2]
I can always find someone
To say they sympathize
If I wear my heart out on my sleeve
But I don't want some pretty face
To tell me pretty lies
All I want is someone to believe

[Chorus]
Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you

[Bridge]
I can find a lover
I can find a friend
I can have security
Until the bitter end
Anyone can comfort me
With promises again
I know, I know

[Verse 3]
When I'm deep inside of me
Don't be too concerned
I won't ask for nothin' while I'm gone
But when I want sincerity
Tell me where else can I turn
Cause you're the one that I depend upon

Honesty is such a lonely word
Everyone is so untrue
Honesty is hardly ever heard
And mostly what I need from you"

And I wish that I could be with the

People of the wind
I want to see 'em again
It's where we used to be free
And that's the place for me
It's just a state of my mind
A thing that's so hard to find"

On the discoteque floor
You were driving me out of my mind
Oh, but I could have sworn
That I saw something more
In your eyes

Oh though you were surrounded
By beauty unbounded
Your glance is intended for me
And though I tried to hide it
I found myself lookin' to see

So, then you took your chances
You made your advances
Your touch took my breath away
But when you said hello
Are you ready to go
Well, I had just one thing to say

If you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings
With old fashioned meanings
Then just stay in love with yourself

If you can't give me love (love) [x5]

Well, you may be the king
Of this discoteque thing
But honey, I ain't looking for that
What I need is a man
Not some so called aristocrat

Oh if only you'd waited
Or just hesitated
Oh maybe just asked me to dance
But you really don't know
Why I don't wanna go
And baby, that's why we don't stand a chance

So if you can't give me love
Honey, that ain't enough
Let me go look for somebody else
If you can't give me feelings

You love me as a friend

I would give you anything
I'd throw my world away
But you don't want to hear that anymore
And you want to hear me say

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right
I'll always need you
I'll never leave you

Come on and lead me on
Tease me all night long
I'd rather be a fool with a broken heart
Than someone who never had a part of you

You know I told you from the start
Exactly how I feel
Time goes on, seems nothing's changed
I'm in love for real

We have never played the games
That real lovers do
So maybe we are better off
Baby, I'd still like this from you

Come on and lead me on
Come on and tease me all night long
Loving you, I know it's right

And all my cares just drift right into space

On the roof, it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me, no, no

So when I come home feeling tired and beat
I'll go up where the air is fresh and sweet
I'll get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat-race noise down in the street

On the roof, that's the only place I know
Look at the city, baby
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roof

And at night the stars, they put on a show for free
And, darling, you can share it all with me
That's what I said, keep on telling you

That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble-proof
And if this old world starts a-getting you down
There's room enough for two

Up on the roof, up on the roof, up on the roof oh now
Everything is all right, every thing is all right, come on
Put down what you're doing tonight
And climb up the stairs with me and see me
You got the stars above and the city lights below oh whoa

775,1979,Joe Jackson,Is She Really Going Out With Him?,"Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (Where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (Where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
And so there goes your proof

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here

But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around this scene
Hey, hey, hey

Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here

Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around"

I see thru you like a window
As soon as you've started
You're ready to go
I'm not the kind
To have the time for you
Because you kiss in the dark
And run away
Kiss in the dark
Kiss in the dark
And run away

My music

It's a funky situation
I keep telling myself
When I'm digging on my radio
Can't think of nothing else

The beat really turns me on
Why can't I last a little longer?
Ooh, how it's killing me
I can't turn it off

It's a feeling in my heart
Tearing me all apart
If I can't depend on my radio
Then I got no place to go

I play my music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

Just a little bit of guitar
And a whole lot of bass
Add a bit of funky jumps, now
I'm really out in space

I don't have to do the town
Ohh, when I feel a little down
Ooh, how my head spins
When I'm feeling the beat

I'm so in love with my radio
From my hands and my feet
It's a strange kind of feeling
You know
You know
You got me rocking and a-reeling

My music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

I can feel the rhythm
You on my mind
And when it comes to this
I can't resist
To let myself unwind

As long as there's music
On my radio
I'm gonna get out my seat
Stomp my feet
And oooh, just let go

My music box
It really makes me shout
My music box
It really knocks me out

Music box
Makes me shout
Music box
Knocks me out

Get out your seat
Stomp your feet
And feel the rhythm to the beat"

The kind of man I am, I got to put you right in your lace
I should lock you up, getyou back for what I saw

That's vengeance, Oh that's vengeance
Yeah that's vengeance he said, that's the law

You've taken your half out of the middle
Time and time again
But now I'm damned if I'll give you and itch
Till I get even

She said: Just because you're stronger and you hold it over me
I'll put the pedal to the floor, and prove to you that I'm free

Oh what, wow

[Verse 1]
One night in a disco on the outskirts of Frisco
I was cruisin' with my favorite gang
The place was so boring, filled with out-of-towners touring
I knew that it wasn't my thing
I really wasn't caring but I felt my eyes staring
At a guy who stuck out in the crowd
He had the kind of body that would shame Adonis
And a face that would make any man proud

[Chorus]
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow
That I've ever seen
Oh what, wow
He's the greatest dancer
Oh what, wow

[Verse 2]
The champion of dance, his moves would put you in a trance
And he never leaves the disco alone
Arrogance but not conceit, as a man he is complete
My crème de la crème, please take me home
He wears the finest clothes, the best designers, heaven knows
Oooh, from his head down to his toes
Halston, Gucci, Fiorucci, he looks like a still
That man is dressed to kill

I buy the paper nearly every day, but I-
Ain't got time to read it, you know-
Ain't no jobs for me in there now anyway but I know-
You can't keep a good man down!

You can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man down
You can't keep a good man-
You can't keep a good man down!

Please don't talk about the plans you've made, honey
I've made some plans myself... you know-
Sometimes the sign says stop but I go and you-
Can't keep a good man down! Listen-

You can't keep a good man down, yeah
You can't keep a good man down
I admit I'd rather fight than quit-
Can't keep a good man down!

Babe! Let's go!

Now take that rich boy who stays home all day, hehe
He's got so much, he really ain't got nothing to say
I'm on the streets and I cover the whole town
Ain't got no money, but you can't keep me down!
No way!

Please don't talk about the plans you've made
I've made my plans for me
You might lock me up, but I'm gonna break free-
You can't keep a good man down!

You can't keep a good man down, like I said now-
You can't keep a good man down, believe me
Don't get tough 'cause I can play too rough-
You can't keep a good man down!
You can't keep a good man down, like I said
You can't keep a good man down, you can't beat me-
I admit I'd rather fight than quit
You can't keep a good man down!"
796,1979,The Tarney/Spencer Band,No Time To Lose,"Every day I walk in shadows
I know not what it is
Heading for

And as the evening lies dying
A gentle heart dies near me sighing
It's still the same
You'll never change

You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
What a game

No time to lose
No time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose

Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose

There ain't no way to see forever
It's only day to day
I'm living for

Like a wheel you keep me turning
Put your love inside me burning
Questions plain
When you're lovin' me

You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game
What a game

No time to lose
No time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose

Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose

You can never understand
We can now be like water
Don't need more to find our way
Just get on where we came
It's a game

No time to lose
No time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose

Go with the flow
Never let go
No time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose

No time to lose
No time to lose"

To mess with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you

You think you're cute just
'Cause you dance with my bro
But you ain't seen nothin'
Baby, I'm gonna get my dancing shoes

'Cause I'm crazy about ya
Got that sparkle in your eyes
And I need your sweet reaction
Just a little bit more

To dance with you
I don't want nobody else
To dance with you

Baby, come real quick
I got some blues to share with you
Oh, I know I've gone shiftless
I'm in a bit of a mess for you

See I'm crazy about you
You got that magic in your eyes
And I need for you to show me
Just a little bit more
