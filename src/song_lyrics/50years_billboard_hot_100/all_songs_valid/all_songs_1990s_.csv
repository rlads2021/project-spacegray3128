0,1990,Wilson Phillips,Hold On,"[Verse 1]
I know this pain (I know this pain)
Why do you lock yourself up in these chains? (These chains)
No one can change your life except for you
Don't ever let anyone step all over you
Just open your heart and your mind
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?
Oh

[Chorus]
Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way
Hold on for one more day

[Verse 2]
You could sustain (Sustain)
Or are you comfortable with the pain?
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness (No, baby)
You got yourself into your own mess (Oh)
Lettin' your worries pass you by (Lettin' your worries pass you by)
Don't you think it's worth your time
To change your mind?
Ooh, no

[Chorus]
Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day?
Things'll go your way (Things'll go your way)
Hold on for one more day

[Bridge]
I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and
Break free from the chains
Yeah, I know that there is pain
But you hold on for one more day and you
Break free, break from the chains

[Chorus]
Someday, somebody's gonna make you wanna
Turn around and say goodbye (Say goodbye)
Until then, baby, are you gonna let them
Hold you down and make you cry?
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
If you hold on
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
If you hold on
Can you hold on?
Hold on, baby
Won't you tell me now?
Hold on for one more day 'cause
It's gonna go your way
Don't you know things can change?
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day, yeah
Can't you change it this time?

3,1990,Heart,All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You,"It was a rainy night
When he came into sight
Standing by the road
With no umbrella, no coat

So I pulled up along side
And I offered him a ride
He accepted with a smile
So we drove for a while

I didn't ask him his name
This lonely boy in the rain
Fate, tell me it's right
Is this love at first sight?
Please don't make it wrong
Just stay for a night

All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, you want me too
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

So we found this hotel
It was a place I knew well
We made magic that night
Oh, he did everything right

He brought the woman out of me
So many times, easily
And in the morning, when he woke
All I left him was a note

I told him I am the flower
You are the seed
We walked in the garden
We planted a tree

Don't try to find me
Please don't you dare
Just live in my memory
You'll always be there

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
I got loving arms to hold onto

Whoa, oh, we made love
Love like strangers
All night long
We made love

Then it happened one day
We came 'round the same way
You can imagine his surprise
When he saw his own eyes

I said, ""Please, please understand
I'm in love with another man
And what he couldn't give me, oh, whoa
Was the one little thing that you can""

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Come on, say you will, you want me too

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew
All I wanna do is make love to you
Say you will, baby, want me too

All night long, all night long
All night long, all night long

All I wanna do, all I wanna do
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

All I wanna do is make love to you
One night of love was all we knew"

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

11,1990,Digital Underground,The Humpty Dance,"[Verse One: Shock G as Humpty Hump]
All right! Stop whatcha doin', 'cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny—but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
Now gather round, I'm the new fool in town
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a ""umpty""
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
I'm steppin' tall, y'all, and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall when the stereos pump me
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
But sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat; look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from getting busy
I'm a freak, I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy, allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance

People say ""Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'""
That's all right cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B
All the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really being sincere
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I get stupid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid
I use a word that don't mean nothing, like looptid
I sang on ""Doowutchalike"", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, ""Just grab 'im in the biscuits""
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
And now I'm gonna do my dance

Oh, yeah!
Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
Let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

[Verse Three]
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
Crazy wack funky
People say 'ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty'
That's all right cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain
Humping, funking, jumping
Jig around, shaking ya rump
And when a doo-doo chump punk points a finger like a stump
Tell him step off, I'm doing the Hump

[Hook]
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doing, doing the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doing the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

And of course I was your guy
We were together forever in love for life
And now it don't seem so very nice

Forever to me was short but sweet
You never let me down
You kept me on my feet
Now today all I have to say
Take it out, girl
And try to find a way

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Believe it or not
I can't get over you
You are my everything
What a dream come true
What I feel for you is really hard to explain
I'm in love, girl
I'll never feel the same

You and me can save our love
We'll be together one day
Like hand in glove
All I have to say is
I'll wait forever and a day

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you

Wait a minute, fellas
This has gotta be a dream
You know
I'm so used to seeing her every single day

My life will never be the same
I know it seems like we just met
And now shes leaving
I'll never find another girl like her

You think if we keep singing this song
She'll hear it on the radio and come back?
Hey guys, I definitely think it's worth a try

Ooh, la la
Ooh, la la
I can't
Can't get over you"
13,1990,En Vogue,Hold On,null
14,1990,Phil Collins,Do You Remember?,"[Verse 1]
We never talked about it
But I hear the blame was mine
I'd call you up to say I'm sorry
But I wouldn't want to waste your time

'Cause I love you, but I can't take any more
There's a look I can't describe in your eyes
If we could try, like we tried before
Would you keep on telling me those lies? (Telling me lies)

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 2]
There seemed no way to make up
'Cause it seemed your mind was set
And the way you looked it told me
It's a look I know I'll never forget
You could've come over to my side
You could've let me know
You could've tried to see the distance between us
But it seemed too far for you to go

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember?)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 3]
Through all of my life
In spite of all the pain
You know people are funny sometimes
'Cause they just can't wait
To get hurt again

[Chorus]
Tell me, do you remember?... (Do you remember?)

[Verse 4]
There are things we won't recall
And feelings we'll never find
It's taken so long to see it
'Cause we never seemed to have the time

There was always something more important to do
More important to say
But ""I love you"" wasn't one of those things
And now it's too late

[Chorus]
Do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, do you remember?... (Do you remember? Now it's over. Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Uh, yeah
Tell me, do you rememeber?... (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Do you remember? (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Now it's over)
Tell me now, tell me now (Do you remember? Uh, it's over)

On the half shell, they're the heroes four
In this day and age who could ask for more?
The crime wave is high with muggings mysterious
All police and detectives are furious
Cause they can't find the source
Of this lethally evil force
This is serious so give me a quarter
I was a witness, get me a reporter!
Call April O'Neil in on this case, and
You'd better hurry up, there's no time to waste!
We need help, like quick, on the double
Have pity on the city, man it's in trouble!
We need heroes like the Lone Ranger
When Tonto came pronto, when there was danger
They didn't say they'd be there in half an hour
Cause they displayed...Turtle Power!

Determined to put these crooks in jail
She spied the bad guys and saw what happened
But before she knew it, she fell in a trap and got caught!
Yeah, she was all alone
With no friends, and no phone
Now this was beyond her worst dreams
Cause she was cornered by some wayward teens
Headed by Shredder they were anything but good
Misguided, unloved, they called them The Foot
They could terrorize and be angry youths, and
They mugged the people. Who needed proof?
Then from out of the dark came an awesome sound!
Shouted ""Cowabunga!"" as they hit the ground
From the field of weeds the heroes rescued the flower
Cause they possessed...Turtle Power!

[Verse 3]
Heroes on a half shell, they're on a mission
When there's a battle got the enemy wishin'
That they stayed at home, instead of fightin'
These ninja masters with moves like lightnin'
They were once normal, but now they're mutants
Splinter's the teacher so they are the students
Leonardo, Michaelangelo, and Donatello
Make up the team with one other fellow
Raphael. He's the leader of the group
Transformed from the norm by the nuclear goop
Pizza's the food that's sure to please
These ninjas are into pepperoni and cheese
Back to the story, it's not hard to find
Ninjas not just of the body but of the mind
Those are the words that their master instructed
But a letter from Shredder has Splinter abducted
That was the last straw, spring into action
Step on The Foot, now they're gonna lose traction
Now this is for real, so you fight for justice
Your shell is hard so you shout, ""They can't dust us off!
Like some old coffee table.""
Since you've been born you've been willing and able
To defeat the sneak, protect the weak
Fight for rights and your freedom to speak
Now the villain is chillin' so you make a stand
Back to the wall, put your sword in your hand
Remember the words of your teacher, your master:
Evil moves fast, but good moves faster
Than light, shining for your illumination
Good versus evil equals confrontation
So when you're in trouble
Don't give in and go sour
Try to rely on YOUR...Turtle Power!

No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet
Will I wake up from this nightmare
A fear that chills me to the bone
Though I may be one of many
I feel so all alone

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voices strong, our futures bright
And thanks to what we've learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

Left by my father with only this scar on my face
Told by my mother that no, you were just a mistake
I have tasted my own hunger
Sold my body to survive
So they'll pay to scratch the surface
But they can't touch what's inside

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voices strong, our futures bright
And thanks to what we've learned from you
We've grown into the children of the night

How I long for something better
Than this life I know too well
Lord I know I'm bound for heaven
Cause I've done my time in hell

We are the children of the night
We won't go down without a fight
Our voices strong our futures bright

Better make tracks
Fast on the double
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Verse 1: Glenn Medeiros]
You take her where she wants to go
And every day you let her know
She's the one who's always on your mind

But she just got an attitude
Leads you on
Then leaves you blue
Can't you see
She's really just a waste of time

One day
She'll treat you nice
Then she turn as cold as ice
But you think
Your love will win her in the end
Think again

[Chorus:]
She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
All this grief
That she's been putting you through
Ooh

She ain't worth it
The girl ain't worth it
Believe me
I know
I know better than
Better than, better than
Bet, bet better than you

[Verse 2: Glenn Medeiros]
She gets you hot
Then leaves you cold
Keeps you waiting on the phone
Cause she knows
You'll always give her one more try

You're not the only boy in town
And she loves playing to the crowd
But tell me
Do you really like standing in line?

You give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Glenn Medeiros:]
I'd like to say she used to be my girl
But that would be a lie
(That would be a lie)

Cause there's no one
In this whole wide world
That could keep her satisfied I know
Cause I tried

[Rap: Bobby Brown]
Jump in
One thing I hate
Is when a girl plays fake
And tries to make me late for another date
Cause I've tried to make you mine

For the last time
So take this here as a dis
And a goodbye

She ain't worth it
Even though she's on the high tip
She better get a grip
And get a grip quick

Fast in a hurry
Cause I won't buckle
The girl's jazzy
But she's nothing but trouble

[Bridge: Glenn Medeiros]
Give her everything you have
And all she does is make you sad
What she really wants to do
Is tell her friends
She did it again

Words are very unnecessary

Vows are spoken to be broken

Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

They can only do harm

So please, stay off my back
Or I will attack, and you don't want that

It's the question of the hour
How can I be sure
Of what I don't know
She comes to me with
A poison in her flower
She steals the miracle of life
Right out of my hand

And she takes the
Part of a woman
Most hard to comprehend
And she multiplies by ten

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

It's the boundary I desire
There is always room enough to feel
Miles and miles of hilly road ahead
And she's got one hand on my heart
And one hand on the wheel

And she moves me one step
Closer to the deeper end
I may never love again

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love

One by one
I take the bitter pills
They're hard to swallow
I go round and round, my head
Is spinning out of control

I will know tomorrow
If I care to live or
Face another day of sorrow
Holding onto happy ever after

One kiss is a dangerous drug
I'll get what I deserve
If I dare to fall in love
One look and she
Shot me in cold blood

Whoa baby, you're way out of line now
Unaware how this all got started
Let me tell it you one more time, boy

I don't wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I'll fight you to the end, baby

I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

I learned something about myself
Last night with you I knew
I didn't want nobody else
And you're scaring me to death now, baby

I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

I don’t wanna fall in love
Love cuts just like a knife
You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby

I don’t wanna fall in love

You make the knife feel good
I’ll fight you to the end, baby"

How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Look at us now, look at us baby
Still trying to work it out, never get it right
We must be fools, we must be crazy

Ohhh... it's a no win situation

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

We lie awake, this wall between us
We're just not talking, we've got so much to say
Let's break these chains, our love can free us
Ohhh... ain't it time we started trying
Ohhh... gotta stop this love from dying

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends
How can we be lovers if we can't be, can't be friends

Baby love is tough but we can take it
How can we be lovers
Baby times are rough but we can make it
We can work it out

How can we be lovers if we can't be friends
How can we start over when the fighting never ends, baby
How can we make love if we can't make amends, tell me

Can't help myself, you're far away with someone else
And I will never find another girl
Who makes me feel, the way you do
When I dream of you

And I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream of you

When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you

When I think of how you made me feel
At a time, when love was real, and you were mine
I start missing all the times we spent
The words we'd say, how I never dreamt
I'd get this way when I dream of you

Oh and I've been seeing, the same visions night after night
Till the morning light
As my soul starts to ache
My heart starts to break in two
When I dream

When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, all night and day
When I dream of you, like dreamers do
I get this way, when I dream of you

I remember looking in your eyes
I loved that most, these were the times

Can't help but miss, the love I knew
When I dream, of you"

Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me

[Verse 2]
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived

[Chorus]
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me

[Bridge]
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

[Verse 3]
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be"

Because you're bad of the heart

How could you be so cruel?
You treat me like a fool
After all I did for you
You cut me like a blade
My trust is slowly fading
Now I don't know what to do

I thought that when you came along
My life would start to change
Instead I saw that I was wrong
My life was rearranged
How I wonder why
You just put my love aside
You threw me in the gutter
And you left me there to lie

Bad of the heart
You never wanted to start
'Cause you're just bad of the heart
You never played the game too smart
'Cause you know you're bad

When I was by your side
You kissed and told me lies
You hurt me each and every day
I made it through the night
Lying to myself
Why did it have to be this way?

I thought that when you came along
My life would start to change

I don't know why your feelings are changing but I've seen it in your face
And all those times when our lips were kissing, our tongues were telling lies
And all those signs I've been missing right there in your eyes

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

I sometimes feel when we're together baby, everything has turned out wrong
And I know you feel exactly the same way but still we carry on
I've been waiting up by the window watching these cars go by
And I tell myself that I'll go through the motions for the last time tonight

So come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye

Now I'm watching the fumes foul up the sunrise, I'm watching the light fade away
And I'm hoping tonight that I'll open the door, and you'll stand here and say

Come on babe, let's kiss this thing goodbye
Better make it sooner than later
Before it all turns sour
Don't you know we'd better kiss this thing goodbye"

Hey, Slim. Come here, check this out
Uh-uh, wait. Let me tell you something
If you ain't got a Bronco, a BMW, a Benz or big bank
Then just [?]
Aw, I knew it. I knew it. I KNEW IT
Another B girl
Yo I think it's about time
We gonna tell Slim about ourselves
Believe that

[Verse 1]
Now let's bring up the subject
Which we brought to mind
Let's discuss the ""B"" girls
Cause they're one-of-a-kind

Now you can find at least five
Wherever you go
Put 'em in your black Benz
Or your blue Bronco

Everything is chill
With the AC pushin'
In your automobile
You call yourself a lady?
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain

[Hook]
""B"" stands for:
Broncos, Benz, BMW, bass, bangles and a pair of bars
When you see us pulling up down the Ave
You'll act like we are stars

We're not tryin' to make a joke
We're just tryin' to make it known
That people of the world that we call ""B"" girls
Like bars on a Cadillac Brougham.

[Verse 2]
Now that ain't it, and I believe
That we had to rehearse
Another rhyme on the line
For the second verse:
About a girl in the city
Her name is Judy
Had breasts like Dolly
With a big old booty

Well she was [?]
And everything was in place
She was my girl for two years
And [?] doctor [?]

When I took her to [?]
She was frontin' 'bout my Nova
And she wanted a Benz

She said ""We need a Benz""
And all of a sudden, I paused -
Who did Judy think I was?
Santa Claus?
You call yourself Judy
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now I was pushin' on my B.M
With no context
It wasn't B.M.W
It was B.M.X
When I seen a young thing
Comin' down the Ave
And I knew from the moment
She's the girl I'd have
So I slammed on the brake
And I asked her name
She said, ""My name is Janice
But my friends call me Jane.""

I said, ""Well Jane, I'm Prince
Can we be friends?""
She said
""Yes, if you could change a BMX to a Benz!""
You call yourself Jane
""B"" girl is your name
And if you don't know what ""B"" means
Let us explain:

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Now me and Prince was at the beach
With a couple of friends --
I parked my Nova by a Bronco
And a baby blue Benz
And passed some bottles around
So I said, [?]
Already drunk from an overdose
Of malt liquor beer

She turned around
And had a nice figure
She said, ""Can't you see me walkin' with my nigga?""

""Hey, so? He's a punk!""

She said, ""I know he's a punk though
But you in a Nova
And he's in a Bronco!""

She came in my face
She kept yakkety-yakkin'
That's when I popped the trunk
I put the clip in the MAC-10

I'm tired of you ""B"" girls
Yeah, that's your name!

And if you don't know what 'B' means
Let us explain:

We could sail away
Or catch a freight train
Or a rocketship into outer space
Nothin' left to do
Too many things were said
To ever make it feel
Like yesterday did
Seasons must change
Separate paths, separate ways
If we blame it on anything
Let's blame it on the rain
I knew it all along
I'd have to write this song
Too young to fall in love
Guess we knew it all along

That's alright, that's okay
We were walkin' through some youth
Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, that's okay
Let's turn the page

My friends called today
Down from L.A
They were shooting pool all night
Sleeping half the day
They said I could crash
If I could find my own way
I told them you were leaving
On a bus to go away

That's alright, that's okay
We were two kids in love
Trying to find our way
Thats's alright, that's okay
Held our dreams in our hands
Let our minds run away
That's alright, that's okay

Smilin' through some pain
That's alright, let's turn the page

And it goes this way

Block Island Sound
I have charted a course to The Vineyard
But tonight I am Nantucket bound
I took on diesel
Back in Montauk yesterday
Left this morning from
The bell in Gardiners Bay
Like all the locals here
I've had to sell my home
Too proud to leave
I work my fingers to the bone

So I could own my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And I go where the ocean is deep
There are giants out there in the canyons
And a good captain can't fall asleep
I got bills to pay
And children who need clothes
I know there's fish out there
But where? God only knows
They say these waters
Aren't what they used to be
But I got people back on land
Who count on me

So if you see my Downeaster ""Alexa""
And if you work with the rod and the reel
Tell my wife I am trolling Atlantis
And I still have my hands on the wheel

Never is, never was
Here and now is all that counts
Here and now in large amounts
Be beautiful but shut up
The going can be real tough

You can keep your fancy bars
Clubby friends and fast cars
And when the going gets hard
You can eat your credit cards
I really tried to fight it
But what the hell, I like it

There is always room at the top
Don't let them tell you there is not
Made in England, born and bred
An eighteenth century brain
In a twenty-first century head

Room at the top, so eighteenth century
Room at the top, so eighteenth century
Room at the top
There's always room

Or like the things that you might do
It's the pleasure and the pain
That makes us do it all again

Fuckin dying young bitch yea im paranoid

Yea im cashed bitch
Still wasted
Tryna change yourself just another waste of time
Back to old habits smokin all the fucking time
Overthinker overthinker
Livin in repetitive

[Yesterday]
U knew what ur gettin into
Now u never wanna see me again
Honestly, can't say that i blame u
Hittin walls all over again
Lakeside, in the headlights, shinin
Tell me why u always gotta lie to me
Give me reasons to believe
That this isnt what it seems
All these ashes on my jeans
Gunna show me what it means to live my life in its entirety
Hate to say things twice
So apathetically, ill refrain one last time
And then its lights out

[Barren]
I been a burden
A disturbance
Yeah
Since fuckin day 1
Yeah i been hurting
Feening for the
Gift of life
To strike me down
Need not say twice
I long for
Your touch
Our lips lock
For the first time
You were finally all mine
But now you’re not
And thats how the story ends
No different
Plot to grow
Yo girl
Won’t leave me alone
I don’t won’t that hoe
If she ain't bringing
Ideas to the table
I need you bitches to be
Willing and able
To go further and further
Then you ever thought
We’ll be climbing to the top
Faster than you can drop
That shit
You call a hit
Motherfuckers know that we in this bitch
No one wants to see
This shit we do
Cause you motherfuckers scared on
What we act on
You bitches can’t see that
We past ya
This brain
Spinning faster and faster
Dizzy from the cardi
Mixed up
With a fuckin blunt
Next year we’ll be touring
Where y’all at
We out front
Finna yuke
If i don’t lay down soon
Gotta practice for tonight
Don’t hit my phone
When i get home
It ain't turning on
Im all alone"
65,1990,Electronic,Getting Away With It,"[Verse 1: Bernard Sumner]
I've been walking in the rain
Just to get wet on purpose
I've been forcing myself not to forget
Just to feel worse

[Pre-Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant ]
I've been getting away with it all my life
(Getting away)

[Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
I love you more than you love me

It makes me feel so worthless
I'm an original sinner but when I'm with you
I couldn't care less

More than you love me

[Bridge: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
I thought I gave up falling in love
A long long time ago
I guess I like it but I can't tell you
You shouldn't really know
And it's been true
All my life
Yes, it's been true
All my life

[Verse 3: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
I've been talking to myself
Just to suggest that I'm selfish
(Getting ahead)
I've been trying to impress
That more is less and I'm repressed
(I should do what he said)

[Chorus: Bernard Sumner and Neil Tennant]
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
However I look it's clear to see
That I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me
I love you more than you love me

67,1990,Tommy Page,I'll Be Your Everything,"So long that I've waited for a girl
To come into my life and in my world
I can't explain my feelings for you
I guess you're just all my dreams come true

And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything

I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me
I'll be your everything

Now that we're together at last
We shouldn't think about our problems in the past
'Cause true love takes a miracle to find
I guess that I've been blessed 'cause I've got you by my side

And I'll be your lover (your lover)
And I'll be your best friend (oh, I'll be your friend)
I'll be there when you're needing me (when you need me)
I'll be your everything, your everything

I'll be your everything (ooh)
I'll give you all that I have, my love, my life and me

When you're lost and you're down and you're seeing darkness
And there's no one there that can be found
Just turn around, I'll be there holding out my arms for you
Just reach for me, I'll be the one to set you free

I'll be your everything
I'll be all that you want and all that you need
I'll lift you up when you're feeling down
I'll make your whole world turn around

68,1990,Don Henley,The Heart Of The Matter,"[Verse 1]
I got the call today, I didn't wanna hear
But I knew that it would come
An old true friend of ours was talkin' on the phone
She said you found someone

[Bridge]
And I thought of all the bad luck
And the struggles we went through
And how I lost me
And you lost you
What are these voices outside love's open door
Make us throw off our contentment
And beg for something more?

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you sometimes
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I knew
I'm learning again

[Chorus 1]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore

[Verse 2]
These times are so uncertain
There's a yearning undefined
And people filled with rage
We all need a little tenderness
How can love survive
In such a graceless age?

[Bridge]
The trust and self-assurance
That lead to happiness
They're the very things
We kill, I guess
Oh, pride and competition
Cannot fill these empty arms
And the work I put between us
You know it doesn't keep me warm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm learning to live without you now
But I miss you, baby
The more I know, the less I understand
All the things I thought I figured out
I have to learn again

[Chorus 2]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But everything changes
And my friends seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me anymore

[Bridge]
There are people in your life
Who've come and gone
They let you down
You know they hurt your pride
You better put it all behind you, baby
Cause life goes on
You keep carrying that anger
It'll eat you up inside, baby

[Chorus 1]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
But my will gets weak
And my thoughts seem to scatter
But I think it's about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

[Chorus 3]
I've been tryin' to get down
To the heart of the matter
Because the flesh will get weak
And the ashes will scatter
So I'm thinking about
Forgiveness, forgiveness
Even if, even if
You don't love me

[Outro]
Forgiveness
(Yeah)
Forgiveness
(Baby)
Forgiveness
(Oh, oh)
Forgiveness
(Ah, yeah)
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
Even if
You don't love me anymore
Forgiveness
(Oh)
Forgiveness
(Ohh)
Forgiveness
Forgiveness

Just what you mean to me

Your love is all I ever need
Holding you close through the night
I need you, yeah

And there I see
What happiness really means

Always wanting more

White lightning
Bound to drive you wild

It was a sin
So sweet and true

71,1990,Timmy T.,Time After Time,"Time after time when we're together
I tell you I love you now and forever
Your doing me wrong but there's nothing I can do
We've been through days when nothing would go right
In your arms your holding me so tight
Please won't you let me come into your heart
We would make love
Through rainy weather
Go to the movies and laugh together
Please won't you see girl what your doing to me

Chorus:
Girl, why don't you just understand
Why I've got to be your man
Why don't you let yourself go
Don't you know

Time after time my feelings are so hurt
It will take both of us to make our love work

I'll give you love if you just give me a chance
Once in your life see that this is real
Will it be pain and sorrow that I feel
If this is love won't you see it through my eyes
Remember the days when we would just hold hands
Holding and kissing in the warm sand
Those were the times when I knew you cared

Chorus

Oh girl, here I am dialing your number
Sometimes I really don't know how you feel about me
But i'm gonna let you know how I feel about you

Nighttime slows
Raindrops splash rainbows
Perhaps someone you know
Could sparkle and shine
As daydreams slide
To colour from shadow
Picture the moonglow
That dazzles my eyes
And I love you

[Chorus]
Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

[Verse 2]
Dream of sights
Of sleigh rides in seasons
Where feelings not reasons
Can make you decide
As leaves pour down
Splash Autumn on gardens
As colder nights harden
Their moonlit delights
And I love you

[Chorus]
Just lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

[Post-Chorus]
Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you

[Bridge]
If love's the truth then look no lies
And let me swim around your eyes
I've found a place I'll never leave
Shut my mouth and just believe
Love is the truth I realize
Not a stream of pretty lies
To use us up
And waste our time

[Chorus]
Lying smiling in the dark
Shooting stars around your heart
Dreams come bouncing in your head
Pure and simple every time
Now you're crying in your sleep
I wish you'd never learnt to weep
Don't sell the dreams you should be keeping
Pure and simple every time

[Post-Chorus]
Look at me with starry eyes
Push me up to starry skies
There's stardust in my head
Pure and simple every time
Fresh and deep as oceans new
Shiver at the sight of you
I'll sing a softer tune
Pure and simple over you

My nights and days are grey
If I reached out and touched the rain
It just wouldn't feel the same

I'd slip down from the top
I'd slide down so low
Girl you'd never, never know
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

Without you, my hope is small
Let me be me all along
You let the fires rage inside
Knowing someday I'd grow strong
Without you, without you
A sailor lost at sea
Without you, woman
The world comes down on me

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you

I could face a mountain
But I could never climb alone
I could start another day
But how many, just don't know
You're the reason the sun shines down
And the nights, they don't grow cold
Only you that I'll hold when I'm young
Only you as we grow old

Without you in my life
I'd slowly wilt and die
But with you by my side
You're the reason I'm alive
But with you in my life
You're the reason I'm alive
But without you, without you"

80,1990,Biz Markie,Just A Friend,"[Verse 1]
Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 2]
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

[Chorus]
You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

[Verse 3]
So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend..."

82,1990,The Cover Girls,All That Glitters Isn't Gold,"[Verse 1:]
Yesterday, I met a boy so fine
Right away I knew
He'd captivate my mind

So strong
The kind you dream about
Baby, together
We could really turn it out

I showed him to
Some friends of mine
They said, girl
Don't waste your time

That boy's no good for you
Listen, girl
I'm telling you
I think it's time you knew that

[Chorus:]
All that glitters isn't gold
Everything you see isn't what it seems to be
(No, oh, oh)
Oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold

[Verse 2:]
Sometimes we make the mistake
Of thinking everything
That looks good is great

We all seem to go for what shines
And then we leave all of
The other things behind

Some people always give a show
Cause it's the only way they know
But you don't have to play that game
Because the only thing that matters
Is what's inside your heart

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So here's my advice to you
Everything you see's
Not always true

Take the time to look inside
And find out for yourself
What's really on their minds

[Repeat Chorus:]

No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold
No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold...

Oh, no, it isn't gold
No, no, it isn't gold
Everything you see's
Not what it seems to be

Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
All that glitters isn't gold
No, no, no

[Repeat Chorus x3:]

All that glitters isn't gold
(No, oh, oh)
No, no
All that glitters isn't gold

No, oh, oh, oh, it isn't gold

87,1990,Seduction,Could This Be Love,"Staring through the windows of time
Drying off the last year of our bind
Was it real or just a mirage?
Love has its way of making you blind
I stared deep into your heart and your soul
And I feel what any woman would want

Why did I run?
Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on
And the feelings stay strong
Memories laugh and play with my heart
Like thunder in a rainstorm
Tell me is this real or just a mirage?
I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love

As we moved our separate ways that day
Tears ran down my face
And I asked myself
Was I just too weak to face the truth
That love is what I have for you

You're someone special deep down inside
Your love is true
Why did I hide?
Why did I run?
Why did I hide?
Because the memories bleed on and on

Time goes on and the feeling stays strong
This word called love
Ae you the one?
That I want
Tell me is this real or just a mirage?
I ask myself

Could this be love
Or just a memory
Of the two of us together
Lifetime friends forever
You and me a unity
Of friendship and love"

And If I know that she's worried, I know I'd feel the same misery
We've been through so much together, we stand as one, that's what makes it better
When something is wrong with my baby, something is wrong with me
And just what she means to me now, oh, you just, you just wouldn't understand
People can say that she's no good, but she's my woman and I know I'm her man
And if he's got a problem, whoa, I know I gotta help him solve them

I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are all I can feel

Remembering you standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in, holding you close
How I always held close in your fear

[Verse 3]
Remembering you running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe, screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage to let it all go

[Verse 4]
Remembering you fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white, so delicate, lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark

[Verse 5]
Remembering you, how you used to be
Slow drowned, you were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes, but I never see anything

I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart

But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
And always just breaking apart

Sippin champagne in a paper cup
Laughing when you're makin love (oh baby)

Dancin' to a sad love song
Even when the music's gone
Kisses that go on and on and on
Cos I'm that kind of girl

Is this first star wishing or woman's intuition
Has my arrow found its mark? Oh! Baby
Cos' all I do is think of you in a fantasy for two
And I've just got to let you know
Cos' being real is in my heart and soul

Don't care bout your money or the car that you drive
Cos' my affection ain't something you can buy

I know that you're afraid to love
You've been hurt before
Love broke your heart so you closed the door
Now here I am outside your world
Wishin' you'd let me in
Give me half a chance to prove you wrong
Baby all your tears have come and gone
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start

Take it to heart, baby believe it
This love is so strong that it won't let you go
Baby hold on, you'll see just how good it's gonna be
It's gonna be here long as you need it
Never take your world and tear it apart
Take it to heart baby

You're gonna have to trust someone
It's a shame if you don't
Because it ain't no life living all alone
Let me show you how to love again
There's no broken heart that love won't mend
Talkin' 'bout a brand new start

I just want to be the one that'll be there by your side
So take this love of mine
Take it to heart

Baby believe it, this love is so strong, love is so strong baby

(love is a second chance to find all that we lost
Love's always worth a try no matter what the cost
I know you don't believe your tears have come and gone
Give me but half a chance and I will prove you wrong)"

99,1990,Whitesnake,Now You're Gone,"Now you're gone
I can feel my heart is breaking
And I can't go on
When I think of the love, you have taken

In the night, I pray for your embrace
Every time, I close my eyes
I can't escape your face, you're out of sight
But, always on my mind
I never realized, my love could be so blind

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?
You're all I need
So maybe we could turn back the hands of time
Maybe we could give it another try, one more time
But, now you're gone
There's an emptiness closing around me
And I can't go on
When all I have left is the memory

In the night, I call out your name
I wake up in a cold sweat
And I'm all alone again, I need your love
Much more than I can say
I realize without you, I can't face another day
You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl
I've been losing my mind
You're all that I want
So maybe we could turn back the hands of time
Maybe we could give it another try
One more time
Baby, just one more time

Now you're gone
I can feel my heart is breaking
And I can't go on
When all of my love has been taken

You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl, I've been losing my mind
You're all I want
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?
You're all that I need
Since I lost you, girl, I've been losing my mind
I've been losing my mind
Can't you feel the love in this heart of mine?

Saying ""I love you""
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know

[Chorus]
What would you do if my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying, ""I love you""

Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me

103,1991,Mariah Carey,I Don't Wanna Cry,"[Verse 1]
Once again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry

[Verse 2]
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

[Chorus]
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no

[Bridge]
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
Said I've given you my heart and soul
(Given you my heart and soul)
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry"
104,1991,Michael Bolton,Love Is A Wonderful Thing,"Birds fly, they don't think twice
They simply spread their wings
The sun shines, it don't ask why
Or what the whole thing means

The same applies to you and I
We never question that
So good, it's just understood
Ain't no conjecture
Just a matter of fact

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

The only thing a river knows
Is runnin' to the sea
And every spring when a flower grows
It happens naturally

The same magic when you're in my arms
No logic can define
Don't know why, just feels so right
I only know it happens every time

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Oh when the cold wind blows
I know you're gonna be there to warm me
That's what keeps me goin'
And our sweet love will keep on growin'

Love is a wonderful thing
Make ya smile through the pouring rain
Love is a wonderful thing
I'll say it again and again
Turn your world into one sweet dream
Take your heart and make it sing
Love, love is a wonderful thing

Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
Love is a wonderful, wonderful thing
It's what makes honey taste sweet
It's what makes your life complete"

Oh, life is bigger
It's bigger than you, and you are not me
The lengths that I will go to
The distance in your eyes
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Verse 2]
Every whisper of every waking hour
I'm choosing my confessions
Trying to keep an eye on you
Like a hurt, lost, and blinded fool, fool
Oh no, I've said too much, I set it up

[Pre-Chorus]
Consider this, consider this
The hint of the century
Consider this the slip
That brought me to my knees, failed
What if all these fantasies
Come flailing around?
And now I've said too much

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

[Bridge]
But that was just a dream
That was just a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
That's me in the corner
That's me in the spotlight
Losing my religion
Trying to keep up with you
And I don't know if I can do it
Oh no, I've said too much
I haven't said enough

[Chorus]
I thought that I heard you laughing
I thought that I heard you sing
I think I thought I saw you try

But that was just a dream
Try, cry, why try?
That was just a dream, just a dream
Just a dream, dream"

Bringing out your higher self
Think of the fine times, pushing
Down the better few, instead of
Bringing out the clues, to what the
World and everything anger to, brace
Yourself with the grace of ease
I know this world ain't what it seems

How could you understand, the way I feel?
How could you relate to so much pain?
Seems as though nothing can comfort me
So today, I pray
That someone should listen, for

Is all that I have gained
I wonder if I could be your miracle

Seems as though nothing will comfort me

111,1991,Queensryche,Silent Lucidity,"Hush now, don't you cry
Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bed
It was all a bad dream
Spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over... or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly you hear and see
This magic new dimension

(I)... will be watching over you
(I)... am gonna help you see it through
(I)... will protect you in the night
(I)... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity

[Spoken word]
""Visualize your dream
Record it in the present tense
Put it into a permanent form
If you persist in your efforts
You can achieve dream control
Dream control
How's that then, better?
Help me""

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

(I)... will be watching over you
(I)... am gonna help you see it through
(I)... will protect you in the night

[Pre-Chorus]
So, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
When love takes hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

[Intelrude]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
The more that I see you
The more I know that love belongs
With you in my mind, boy
I wouldn't know what's right from wrong
'Cause love will take over
And leave you out of sight and mind
Sight and mind
You've got to go with the feeling
And trust fate to be kind

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
When love takes hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

[Interlude]
Let's do it
Oh oh oh oh
Let's do it

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby
Let your conscience go
There's no turning back
Once love gets hold

[Chorus]
Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long

Hold me, baby
Drive me crazy
Touch me
All night long
Make me love you
Kiss and hug you
Touch me
All night long"
113,1991,Rod Stewart,Rhythm Of My Heart,"[Verse 1]
Across the street, the river runs
Down in the gutter, life is slipping away
Let me still exist, in another place
Running under cover of a helicopter blade
Flames are getting higher in effigy
Burning down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, someway
Where they're downing only deer, a hundred steel towns away

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing

[Verse 2]
Photographs and kerosene
Light up my darkness
Light it up! Light it up!
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Running down the alley, I've got my eyes all over you, baby
Oh, baby

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I'll be sailing
I will

[Verse 3]
Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shifting like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yanking back the handle
No expression on my face

[Chorus]
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you"" rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
The rhythm of my heart
Is beating like a drum
With the words, ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
No, never will I roam
For I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky, I'll be sailing
Ooh, hoo-hoo, ooh"

But eleven out of twelve is bound to hurt
The pay's pretty good and the benefits are fine
But I got a little girl and I wanna make her mine

Don't mind telling you i get a little mad
To get a bit ahead takes all the time I have
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not getting soft
All I want is a couple days off

Can't wait for the weekend
Ah baby just can't wait no

I don't need another high song to sing
I don't need a shiny new diamond ring
I don't need to meet nobody else
I just need a little time for myself

'Cause I'm only human, I am no machine
I need a little R&R if you know what I mean
Don't misunderstand me
I'm not getting soft
All I want is a couple days off

Just a couple days
Aww let me catch my breath

Thank god for the weekend!

Ahh back to the old grind

I don't need another long coffee break
I've had as much coffee as a man can take
I need to change my disposition
Change my point of view
I need time to figure out what i want to do

Believe me when i tell you it gets a little rough
We work a little harder but it never is enough
I'm not afraid to say
I'm a total loss
All I want is a couple days off

Can't wait for the weekend"

Ah yeah, it's the home of the microphone master, Houdini
I'm dope, some don't believe me
Unless, I stress and bust a cap from steel
Aim for the dome, show em that I'm real hardcore
The underground rapper who's wrecking
I pack a Smith and Wesson on my right section
I'm strapped, at all time, Jack
Nine mill's the gat, for a punk chump new jack
I must stay focus and keep my mind open
The world's mass confusion, there mad guns smoking
For punks trying to get respect and yearning
Mess around and catch a bad one from Erick Sermon
I'm serious, boy, but not Jermaine Jackson
I also have a 12 gauge shotgun for action
So chill, back the hell up and get a grip
Get off that, thinking that you're all that real quick
Like the Rude Boys said
It's written all over your face, punk, nobody's safe

Nobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked(4x)

[PMD]
It's the hardcore rap music that make your ears ring
Droids of funk, produce a song to make my fans sing
Singing, swinging, hum along, thump my rap song
I bet I get wreck on a DL, then the P's gone
Poof, no phonebooth, cape, or tight suit
Dress in all black, black skullcap, black down goose
To hide the mossberg, word, wit the pistol grip
Squeeze em quick, so use caution wit the loose lip
Cuz loose lips sink ships, don't be the ship to catch a nine clip
I ain't going out on some bull----
Bankshot, corner pocket, now watch me rock it
Can't mock the rap style so, boy, stop it
(So what's the name)John Doe, 'K it's a slow flow
Swift Smith, crazy, the boy's loco
Like Neon Deion Sanders, call him primetime
(It's the new style) time to get mine
Cuz nobody's safe in the fast pace of the rap race
So keep your hoodies on and your boots laced
Now I'm out, beaming back to the boon dox
Nobody's safe chump, so keep your doors locked"

Song:   Do You Want Me

You said it loud, and I heard you
Never tried to hurt you
Some say I'm old-fashioned
I like to take my time and do it slow
You know with the flow
But don't try to rush it
So ride it like a horse
And let nature take its course
Get to know each other
Be my friend not just my lover
Share your thoughts with me
Love my mind not just my body, baby

CHORUS
Do you really want me, baby?  Let me know
Cuz if you really like me I suggest you tell me so
Got no time for silly games, that ain't even why I came
Cuz I may be the kind of guy you like

Please understand the way I feel
I must have trust or there's no deal
My emotion's ain't to be
Played with or given free
I appreciate greatly
The way you toleratered me
Sometimes I do act flaky
I wouldn't blame you if you hate me
You put up with my butt
When I wouldn't give it up
Yeah, I know that really sucks
But if you wait awhile, I'll make it up

CHORUS

Who me?  A tease?  Brother, please
You're just having bad memories
About some skeeze who did the squeeze
And had you on your hands and knees
Look, I am telling you straight out
That's not what I'm all about
I'd just be playing myself out
If I spent the night at your house
Now don't get me wrong
I didn't mean to turn you on
We haven't known each other long
But this is my life not just a song

125,1991,Gerardo,We Want The Funk,"'Excuse me, where have I seen you?', they tend to ask me
A humble answer I give them as we
Start to get closer, but then even more so
They all persist on rubbing my torso
I'm Latin, but I ain't wrapping in satin
No, that old disco look just ain't happening
I'm fresh and new and making my debut
So let me run this information by you
It's true we outdo, it has become an issue
Love 'em and leave 'em fast, we won't miss you
Its tradition, we're well conditioned
We outlast the competition, so listen
We don't care too much about kissing, no
We know just what you've been missing, ho
We're straight out and blunt, we don't put up with stunts
Baby, you know what we want...

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk

Don't play shy, don't expect long good-byes
These are some of the rules that we go by
No demands and forget holding hands
Please, not around our friends
We intend to hold on to our image
Don't try to cross the line of scrimmage
Don't say you weren't aware, so have yourself prepared
And beware, this is a one-time love affair
See, 'that's as far as it goes' is our motto
And you thought you won the lotto
Waiting to claim your prize, you go unrecognized
Huh! How's that for a surprise?
So save yourself from confusion and sorrow
Don't even think about tomorrow
Tonight's the night, enjoy! We're here to make some noise
Let me hear the high pitch in your voice

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk

Smoother than James Bond, you wake and we're gone
So you wonder what you did wrong, huh?
Don't be blaming yourself, it's a must that we vanish
Here's the scoop straight to you, but in Spanish...

Oye nena, rubia o morena
Mi excusa est en mis venas
Soy un simple mujeriego no lo niego ni miento
Soy latino cien por ciento
As que piensa lo bien si no es conmigo con quien es?
Responde de una vez
No te me hagas la importante la dificil o atorrante
Al cabo tengo mas amantes
No te prometo nada saldrs por donde entrastes
Yo no pienso molestarte
As que no me busques
Me sigas, me asustes
Busca otro que te la ajuste

Now there it is laid out plain and simple
In Spanish, but on tempo
Can't comprehend at all? Confused or in a hole? Yo!
What's the matter? No habla espanol?
If that's the case then no need to worry
Bust out the dictionary
You want some inside info? Wanna know what you're in for?
Look up right under 'nympho'

We want the funk
Give up the funk
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk"

On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland

Hovered around his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing
Waiting for The King
Down in the Jungle Room

Would be glad to see you

But boy you've got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
Do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said
""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said
""Ma'am I am tonight""

What comes naturally

I've been holding back my love
For such a long time
Nobody's come along that
I would want to call mine

My phone's been ringing but
My heart, it just won't answer
I can't pretend cause
It's love I'm after

(I've been looking)
I was not prepared for
What I saw in your eyes
I saw something I've been
Waiting for a long time

(Let's get together)
We just met but I know
That you're no stranger
I can tell that
My heart's in danger

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally
There's a time to be wild
There's a time to be free
Let's get together and
Do what comes naturally

I could play hard to get
But what good would that do me
You'd look into my eyes and
You would see right through me

This is a powerful feeling
That we're feeling
I can't deny
It's my heart you're stealing

(I've been looking)
I want to tell you now
That I am not afraid
I'll let the walls come down
Tonight I'm feeling brave

Any chance that I'm taking
This could turn out to be
Love we're making

Set your love free
Falling in love
Should come naturally

Get together and
Do what comes naturally
Get together and
Do what comes naturally

Crazy, crazy, it's getting kind of wild
Is that a yes I'm seeing in your smile
I don't know you, but I feel we're connected
One look from you and baby I'm affected

I can tell that you're reading my thoughts
But let me tell you now I'm not afraid of getting caught
The risk is worth any chance we're takin'
'Cause this could turn out to be love we're makin'

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me

She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon

She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling a private tune

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

[Chorus]
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride.""
Join the joyride

[Verse 3]
She's a flower, I could paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run

Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, whoa no

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Cause it all begins again when it ends, yeah
And we're all magic friends (magic friends, magic friends)

[Chorus]
She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride.""
Join the joyride

She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride.""
Be a joyrider, ow

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
I'll take you on a sky ride
I'm feeling like I'm spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who rocks you like a baby

[Outro]
She says, ""Hello (hello) you fool (you fool) I love you (I love you)
C'mon join the joyride.""
Join the joyride

Hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon join the joyride
Join the joyride

Hello, hello, you fool, I love you
C'mon, c'mon join the joyride

129,1991,Styx,Love At First Sight,"Driving past your house again I feel the same way I did then
I get weak, just thinking about you
It all began so easily a look from you a glance from me
Then our eyes met like thunder and lightning

You and I
Strangers lost in a moment
Eye to eye
We were caught unaware by this passion inside us

Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, so rare, and so exciting
Only hope this love we found can last

I'm not a man who acts this way but lately I can't concentrate
And I don't sleep, just dreaming about you
I try to reach you on the phone but voices there say you're not home
My heart aches, just thinking I've lost you

One more time
Seeing your face in the moonlight
One more chance
To be caught unaware of this passion inside us

Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, it's hard to keep your balance
Moving past the point of no return

If you need some time
To understand your feelings
If you need some time away
I'll be waiting for you with open arms my love

All that night
We made love in the moonlight
Eye to eye
We were so unaware of this passion inside us

Love at first sight, I know that this can't be happening
No, not to someone like me
Love at first sight, it's rare, and so exciting
I only hope this love we found can last
Oh I only hope this love can last, can last"

For the strength, to stay away
In and out, out and in you go
I feel your fire
Then I lose my self control

How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?
How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?
How can I ease the pain?
Every time
That I let you in
You take away
Something deep within
A fool for love
Is a fool for pain
And I refuse
To love you again!

[Chorus]
How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?
How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?
How can I ease the pain?

How can I ease it...

[Bridge]
If it's not love
You've come here for
Tell me baby, why you're here
Knock, knock, knockin' at my door
I can't take it, no more, no more
No more, no more baby...
Give me all, or nothin' at all!

[Chorus]
How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?
How can I, ease the pain?
When I know you're comin' back again
How can I, ease the pain in my heart?

I need to know how... How can I
How can I ease the pain?"

Down on their knees

I'm in too deep
The hours getting late and it's time to leave

I missin' you before you 're gone
Don't understand
What's in my heart
I look at you and don't know where to start
Should I let it show
That something 's changin'
'Cause it's feeling so right and I hear myself saying:

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There's a cool breathe blowing in the curtains way
I kiss your lips and you touch my face

Is this real
Or on my dreaming?
I wonder which you're thinkin' I can tell
If it's a found tomorrow we 'll fix itself
'Cause I don't wanna loose this feeling
When I look in your eyes I here myself saying:

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There 's no hurry
I only want this moment

Want this moment to last

If you believe in love
Say where I do

Maybe this is a chance:
You don't have to go

You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here

So better stay right here

The sun came shining through the trees
Made shadows on the road
I was driving home
The morning after with the taste of you
Still on my tongue

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

On the harbour bridge
The rain was gently falling down
On a lazy summer day
Your face appeared there on my windscreen
You smiled and slipped away

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute
I'll never find a better love not in a minute
Never a better love, never a better love

You are my safety zone
I live and breathe in you
You are where I belong
I live and breathe in you

I'll never find a better love not in a minute ...."

Lonely fear lights up the sky
Can't help but wonder why
You're so far away
There, you had to take a stand
In someone else's land
Life can be so strange
I wish we never had to choose
To either win or lose
We could find a way
We could find a way
But I won't turn my back again
Turn my back again
Your honor I'll defend
So hurry home till then
(Till then)

Stand tall, stand proud

Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright

I'm not here to justify the cause
Or to count up all the loss

Just can't let you feel alone
When there's so much love at home
We're sending out to you
All the courage that you've known
The bravery you've shown
Clearly lights the way
We pray
To make the future bright
To make the wrong things right
Right or wrong
We're all praying you remain strong
That's why we're all here singing along
Hey, hey

Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Know in your heart
How our love burns bright

Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright

You are the light
Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
Are crying out loud, ooh
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright

Stand tall, stand proud
Voices that care
Are crying out loud
And when you close
Your eyes tonight
Feel in your heart
How our love burns bright

And the guiding light
Feel in your heart

Trying to make the pieces fit

But now he says he knew about it from the start
Yeah, he knew about us all along

Looking for a angel but heaven can't be found

But that don't make it right

Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really have opened the door
I know, I know, you gotta love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love

There's a sad face in the mirror and I'm sad to say it's me
Like a ghost up in the attic only love can set you free

I've been running round in circles on this roller coaster ride
There's a lonely world around us, we get sucked in by the tide

I said hey, love ain't a crime
So why is everybody so afraid to cross the line

Does anybody really fall in love anymore
Does anybody really give their heart to somebody
Does anybody really have opened the door
I know, I know, you gotta love somebody
I know, I know, I've got to find somebody to love

I said hey, I'll be alright
Cause I know that someone somewhere's gonna
Say these words tonight

All the denouncement had absolutely no effect
Parents and counselors constantly scorn them
But people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them

Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to, perhaps they are perplexed
When you see them holding hands, they are making future plans
To engage in the activity; do you understand me?

People are still having sex
Lust keeps on lurking
Nothing makes them stop;
This AIDS thing's not working

People are still having sex;
It's been going on for quite a while
Perhaps it is quite fashionable
It hasn't gone out of style

It's a fact that people are still having sex;
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects
The evidence is all around that everyone in every town
Has had it at one time or another in their life

At this very moment, people are still having sex
In a downtown condo or a street in the projects
Even though you can't see them, or hear their breathing sounds
Someone in this world is having sex right now

People are still having sex
People are still having sex
People are still having sex
People are still having sex

Why don't I feel her cry for help?

The streets of this town

I head for the arena where lovers try their fate

Moving through the darkness
I take my place and wait

Intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle
We set our bodies free
And while the music played on
She loved me down from A to Z

The night is getting longer
I start to realize
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back
The S.E.X. is just too good

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I should've read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind
I must have been blind
I never knew another lover that was evil under cover

Then I discovered you, girl
You're like no other
Doing the time for the crime
I was blind
To the games that you were playing
Words that you were saying

Going out of my mind
You're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact
You got the knack to drop a man to his knees

P.A.S.S.I.O.N
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N"

We've been together so long

But I've found someone new
There's nothing you can say or do
To try and change my mind
Would be a waste of time
Let's go our separate ways
There's nothing more to say

Just try to ease your mind
'Cause I don't mean to hurt you
It's just he's knows to treat me like a special lady
It's time you look away
He's knows just how to touch me

It makes you do what you love

He's knows I can't resist
Ooh, his perfect lips
When he looks in my eyes
I feel like I've been hypnotized
I've wanted him for so long
What I felt was oh so strong
In time feelings changed
Things were not the same

I can feel the thunder storms inside
I wake every morning and the cold winds cover me
All I've got's a ghost of what could be
If you can see the lights shine in front of me
If you can see the lights shout out where you'll be

I'm in a broken dream I stare out into space
You know I called you up cos nothing takes your place
I've got a heart of stone and it's sinking deep inside
I want to tell you love I'm too proud to cry

Now I feel it again
No matter how hard I try
This feeling won't end
So I pretend you're here by my side
Tonight on this lonely ride
I keep telling myself that...

Chorus:
Life goes on
While your miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on
As night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

You healed up my wounds
I tasted your tears
You spilled out your heart
So I let out my fears
But one fear I kept to myself
How I prayed that you loved no one else
Like you're saying you love me...

Chorus:
Life goes on
While your miles away
And I need you
Time rolls on
As night steals the day
There's nothing I can do

If you only knew
How much I miss you

Solo

When my mind plays it's tricks on me
It shows me things I don't want to see
That's why I tell myself now
I keep telling myself now
Just take another piece of me...

Life goes on
While your miles away

Time rolls on
As night steals the day

While your still miles away

I travel with you

154,1991,Yo-Yo Featuring Ice Cube,You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo,"[Intro: Ice Cube]
Yo Jinx, man, we gotta find somebody that's down for hers, man
All these girls sympin', man!
Who you think fit the category?

[Intro: Yo-Yo]
It's me, the brand new intelligent black woman Y-O-Y-O
Which is Yo-Yo, but I'm not to be played like I was made by Mattel.
But this Yo-Yo is made by woman and male
I rhyme about uprising, uplifting the woman
[?] superior to handle any male
Any time, any rhyme, any flow, and any show
And if you ask my producers, they'll reply “No…”

[Hook: Ice Cube & Yo-Yo]
You can't play with my Yo-Yo!
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out

[Verse 1]
My name is Yo-Yo, I'm not a **, no
I like to flow so swift, it's got to be a gift
So yo, let the beat lift as I rip and rhyme
And rap and slap all the girls who can't adapt
To the fact I hit the 8-ball often
The earrings I wear are called Dolphins
Check the booty, yo, it's kind of soft and
If you touch it, you living in a coffin (Word to mother)
I'm in the 90s, you're still in the 80s, right?
I rock the mic, they say I'm not lady-like
But I'm a lady, who will pull a stunt though
I K-O suckas, and even hit the blunt
So what you wanna do? You must play hit and run
'Cause to me, you simply can't get none
You wetter than a hot ** in snow
Tell 'em, Ice Cube!

[Hook: Ice Cube & Yo-Yo]
No you can't play with my Yo-Yo!
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Suckas
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
You can't play with my Yo-Yo!
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
Don't try to play me out, don't try to play me out
What's your name baby?

[Verse 2]
That's right, my name is Yo-Yo, but no, I'm not a Duncan
As I rap, Chilly Chill bring in the funk and
I'll steal yo man, that's if he is a hunk and
He'll call me Baby Yo, or even Pumpkin
I may be Buttercup, or even Miss Yo
We had dinner, and now we drinking Cisco
Hit the slow jams, it's getting cozy
You're home alone, so now you getting nosy
You're kind of young
So of course you had to call my place
Hang up in my face
It's a sad case of who your man's giving the dollars
What? Yep, I put lipstick on his collar
At home, he's gotta listen to ya holler
But he'll slap you, and sock ya, so why bother?!
But if you come knocking at my door (Ayy yo)
I'll smoke you, tell 'em, Ice!

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, sucka
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo, yo, yo
Fool, 1990, stayin' sucka free, haha!
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo!
Yeah, tell em whats up

[Verse 3: Yo-Yo]
Yo, I hope you realize one day
That you're ""weak"" as Monday through Sunday
So listen to my Y-O, here's my bio
And next to me?
Ha! You're not fly, yo?!
You lack skills to be a woman that's black
Fake hair in the back, plus green contacts?!
Yo-Yo, is just trying to stop ya
Because the world ain't a big soap opera
It only takes one punch to drop ya
And then the I.B.W.C. will come mob ya
But no, I'm not living like that verse
Although I pack a real small Gat in my purse (right, right)
But no, it's not to cause corruptions
Just to fight back on destruction
Just thought you wanna know about the Y-O-Y-O
Yo, should I tell 'em, Ice?

[Hook] (Ice Cube)
They know what time it is
Fools, yeah!
You can't play with my Yo-Yo, yo yo
I'm out. I thought you knew!

Yo-Yo, the brand new intelligent black lady
Stompin' to the 90s!
For all y'all suckas
Aye Jinx, I knew they couldn't fade it
You can't play wit my Yo-Yo

[Verse 4]
I'm similar to a metaphor, makes them want to yell on
But keep it at a limit to where they're yelling, ""More, more!""
I am very versatile, changing my ways to different styles
Knowledge is the key, experience is from my background
Label me as a woman, and sometimes I feel inferior
Falling back on the hands of time makes no man superior
Should we dare to take the stand
And diss back all the men
Who know no more but [?] and thinks wit his ding-a-ling?
I think it's time that we defeat by standing on our on two feet
If we wanna live with justice and harmony
How many more rounds must I go in order to let my people know
Times were hard, things have changed (Don't try to play me out)"
155,1991,The Escape Club,I'll Be There,"Over mountains, over trees

Don't be afraid, oh, my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight to be with you
'Cause I'm on your side
And I still care
I may have died but I've gone nowhere
Just think of me and I'll be there

On the edge of a waking dream
Over rivers, over streams
Through wind and rain, I'll be there
Across the wide and open sky
Thousands of miles I'd fly
To be with you, I'll be there

Don't be afraid, oh, my love

'Cause I'm on your side

Just think of me and I'll be there

In the breath of a wind that sighs
Oh, there's no need to cry
Just think of me and I'll be there

Don't be afraid, oh, my love
I'll be watching you from above
And I'd give all the world tonight to be with you

I had to leave you like I always did
You knew damn well I'd come again

My resistance is wearing thin
Somewhere in the distance
Like a long lost friend
Whoa oh oh oh, yeah--
Lord, here I come again
Come again

Been so long since I've seen you girl
Swear I've been around the world
Every room is an empty space
In the darkness, I see your face

When I finally get my hands on you
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Lay you down, strip you bare
Make love to you 'til the morning comes around

157,1991,Monie Love Featuring True Image,It's A Shame (My Sister),"[Verse 1]
My sister, my sister, tell me what the trouble is
I'll try to listen good and give the best advice that I can give
So, what's up with you this time?
Your honey took a dive and now he's playin with your mind?
Oh no, this can not be accepted
The feelings that belong to you must be protected
Hold up, time out, I shout, get it together sister
Tell him to be nice or ditch the mister

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2]
Get back on your feet please
I'm beggin you to check out all your own needs
Don't let nobody see you in a state of grievin, over the brother
There's another possibility
Which is for you to work out where you went wrong
I guarantee to you that it will not take long
For you to make your mind up if the two of you belong
You know where honey's head at, and where he's comin from
Get it out your system, don't be another victim
This took the nerve, oh boy, he really picked em, whaddya know
It's time for you to show you're not sleepin
A progress report on the two of you, you're keepin
Peekin through the peephole, to see if honey's sneakin
You estimated right, that night the other weekend
Collectively the facts should conclude the decision
You caught the brother in a terrible disposition

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!
(repeat 2X)

[Verses 3]
That's it, pack it up, be wise my sister
Cause the facts keep stackin up, tell him, to kiss the you know what
Make sure the door is shut, behind you
I do believe the brother's out of luck, and stuck
But that's not, your P-R-O-B-L-E-M
You gotta let him go and let him know this is the end
You've been kissed, dissed, listed as a dumb one
I hope he likes sad songs, he's gonna hum one
He's been a dum dum and that's the way it is forever
There comes a time, when you're at the end of your tether
And you know, I think you went FAR beyond that
So it was bound to backtrack
And smack you with an irksome vengeance as it attacks you
Makin sure you get the full entire view
Of who's to blame, at the end, of the game
Things will never be the same
And it's a cryin shame

[Chorus]
It's a shame, the way you mess around with my heart
It's a shame, the way you, hurt me!

From this day on you'll never walk alone

You're a part of me

Whatever we go through
Whatever time may take away

I can see it when I look up in the sky
I can feel it when I hear that lonesome highway
So many miles to go before I die

We can never know about tomorrow
But still we have to choose which way to go
You and I are standing at the crossroads
Darling, there is one thing you should know

You're a part of me

Whatever we go through
Whatever time may take away
It cannot change the way we feel today

To look for something we may never find

We must have been stone crazy
When we thought we were just friends
'Cause I miss you, baby
And I've got those feelings again
I guess I'm all confused about you
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

[Verse 2]
Suddenly we're strangers
I watch you walking away
She was my one temptation
Oh, I did not want her to stay
Deep down, I'm still confused about you
(Oh yes I am baby)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

[Chorus]
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about you, shi-pow-pow

What good is being here without you? (I wanna know)
I feel so in love
Oh, baby, what can I do?

Round and round and round
Round, round

Can you tell me where we're going to?
Can you tell me what it is we really want to find
Is the truth really there?
Or is it right under our hair?
For all we know
It's been there all the time

Nothing comes from dreamers but dreams

Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream

Round and round
We go round and round and round
And what we're looking for still isn't found

Can you tell me when we gonna get to it

I said I want to do it
I learned my lesson young

I say
If you really want to have fun
Go for it and when you win
Say ""I go for it""

One day
I'll make it in the big city
And I'll be looking for a girl who's pretty

One day
I'll make a play and she will say ok
'Cuz I plan to be a cool kitty

Sitting idle in our boat
While everyone else is down the stream

172,1991,After 7,"Nights Like This (From ""The Five Heartbeats"")","(Verse 1):

Too much to think about
Too easy not to think about
But the pain make you bring it out
Maybe this something i should drink about
Thinking if the game and the fame gon bring a lil change
Now i'm just contemplating liquor
But you know it start get ya
When ya mind start to flicker
Like maybe this something i should really fuck think about
A penny for my thoughts
Turned to nickels for my lines
And rapping all these lines
Started gettin me the dimes
Now i'm feelin like man i'm exactly what the game need
Quarters turned into my dollar for a dream
But then you spending checks when you really should be saving
Man fuck a freestyle when you write it like Langston
But you got the five heartbeats
Then the temptations
And ya conscience start the whispers
And you really can't take it
I'm just sayin

(Chorus):

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

(Verse 2):

Then you try to flip a dollar
Just to get something new
Now you touchin bases
Turnin one into two
Like baseball
One day its gon pay off
Plus you know 3's coming soon
But then you start to panic
But you can't get flustered
Cuz its a cold war
So you know they start rush ya
But you a rare kind and they'll never be another
Plus its a cold world
Be sure to bring a cover
Cuz the 4 in sight
Turn to 5 by night
Man a 6 would be fine
But you want 7-8-9
But then you hit 10
Think you never win again
Then you pray to god and you see its all meant
So you finally see that you can't be stopped
Told you shoot for the moon so you aim for the top
So you finally see exactly why you got the rock
4th quarter down 2 and then you take the shot

(Chorus):

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two
4th quarter and you down two

And i ain't even finish
Cuz i ain't even win yet
But i know that i'm bound to
4th quarter and you down two


ThaNuRelijun:

Dear God
I think i found a new religion
And its based on the true condition that was truly missing
I was thinking of my brother who think they found you in prison
And my other brothers that drown in the new prescription
Cuz they been praying every night
But they feel like you don't listen
I became the smartest
When i took my art sense
Mixed it with my darkness
And became a true artist
So now i'm putting portraits
On vinyls or murals with a title
These illustrations i'm painting
Are truer than the bible
I mean no disrespct but this is the new religion
Like expressionizm
If you close ya eyes and envision a television
But without a picture
Just scriptures that come to life
Or headless sculptures that walk around at night
All i need is one mic
Shit now i might need 3
Promise before i die to get the revolution
On TV or maybe in 3D
You think that they'll see it then
I mean just picture me rollin
The blackGOD lacing my rap ties
And after i die just play this and close ya eyes
If you ever wanna see me again
I mean im like Edgar Allan but with better styling
This my tell tale heart but with 11 volumes
Sculptures and portraits portrayed
From photo albums stuck in my memory
I just hope they remember me through infinity"
173,1991,Daryl Braithwaite,Higher Than Hope,"I remember long ago
Many things we didn't know
But hear me say
We still have time

Too many people
Change the world we live in
They don't know
They'll run out of time

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

Every stone that's been placed in
The Empire of Ancient grounds
One day they'll fall - you'll say goodbye

United they stand
Today there one land
Nobody knows
Who'll say goodbye

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer
Stand up and let them know
That you just won't let go

I hear that voice getting stronger
You know that it's higher than hope
We won't have to wait any longer

I want to break down the walls that hold me inside
I want to reach out, and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name

I want to feel the sun on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from poison rain

Where the streets have no name

We're still building, then burning down love
Burning down love

I go there with you
Where the streets have no name
Can't take my eyes off of you

I love you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night
So let me love you, baby
Let me love you

The city's aflood, our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place, high on a desert plain

176,1991,Stereo MC's,Elevate My Mind,"I wanna go higher (x3)
I wanna go higher (higher baby) (x2)

If I ever get down in the dumps
Short of a dollar nothin change for months
It seems to rain about every day
And all the news seeme kinda grey
Its no illusion call it reality
So I release more charge from my battery
We can rise death defy gravity
Bring about a sense of personality
So as I walk I look around
See some go up , some go down
There goes the man his nose is brown
Guess how he get to wear his crown
But his hands are shaking the walls are breakin
And one day they will all fall down
Sometimes its better that way
Makin space for a some better day

We're on the ground floor got lots to learn
Slip to the basement and you burn
First floor and you start to fall
Out the bed clothes answer the door
On the second I comprehend
Positive waves are what I send
Third floor and you start to flow
Tell me now where d'ya wanna go

(higher baby)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
Were'd you wanna go?
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)

So tell me baby kinda shakey
We ain't been too friendly lately
Things sometimes turn out that way
And that is all that you got to say
Well thats ok cause time can soothe
Like a dentist pulls out a tooth
As each new day will bring a new face
How can I make my rhyme go someplace

First of all she ask for more
I said sure I dont mind at all
The waters deep but I'm walking tall
It dont matter if you're rich or poor
Ain't here to score just raise the floor
Maximum vibes what I'm aiming for
I do my war dance back to the wall
Just returning my native call

And thats the way we're getting by ya
Always keeping you on the wire
Takin you higher - call me a liar
But you won't cause you're feeling inspired
Work we're going to , jerk you're all thru
Theres no way you'll stop my breakthru
Two ways to do it , get in or get out
Elevate yourself don't hang about
So wherever lies you'r latitude
Wherever you are we're gaining altitude
In all directions starting to climb
So come on girl - elevate my mind

I wanna go higher (elevate my mind)
I wanna go higher (higher baby)
(Let it reach ya) I wanna go higher (higher baby)
(Elevate my mind) I wanna go higher (higher baby)

I wanna go higher (x3)"

The bell rang cuz I started to talk yet the class is not there no more

(Yo Red, where'd you meet her?)

Red:
At the playground, ya know
That's where I saw this cutie
This girl was swingin' and she looked so fly
On the monkey bars, we climbed up to the top and
She touched my hand that's when I fell in love

Chris:
Iesha..
You are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha..
You know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do
To keep me away from you

Mike Bivins:
Yo Dallas man these five young boys out of Atlanta GA are a real mental
They kinda like remind me of me and my boys New Edition, know what I'm saying
So all you people out there ridin' in your cars listening to the radio station
Or cold maxin' in ya living room watching this here video, check the 2nd verse

We played Nintendo
This was her very first date
I didn't wanna make it seem to fly
We ate cereal
She couldn't stay out at late
Her mother told her to be home at nine

Chris:
Iesha..
You are the girl that I neva had
And I want to get to know you bettah
Iesha..
You know I want you so bad
And there's nothing anyone can do

Take my advice

You put your hand near the fire and you're sure to get burned

I pulled them down for you, just when I fell in love again
You said that all good things must end

Baby, that's just the way it is baby
Baby, that's just the way it is baby

I've never had a hand for solitaire
It's so unfair
That I should have my chance and lose
I feel like I've been used to help you through another night
You spelled it out in black and white

They bring you back today
The time has washed away my pain
I find that things have changed and disappeared without a trace
You can't get back what you've erased

Through every trial we'd ever care to go
When I look back I almost can't believe it
We're not the same people that we used to know
With all the years behind me spent pretending
I didn't need someone like you around
It makes it even harder to imagine
The life I'd be livin', if I hadn't found

Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you

When there was no one left for me to turn to
When all the world I knew was fallin' down
Oh there were times I could not face the mornin'
But everything's changed since the day that I found

Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true
Someone to love me.......the way that I love you

Come on-Come on-Come on-Come on now!!

Someone to hold me, the way that you do
Someone who needs me, the way I need you
Someone to show me, a way that is true

There's a part of me that's trying to bring back your love again
There are times when I just want to run, but there's no place to hide
Even though my heart is breaking in a million bits inside
I can make believe that none of this is true

[Chorus:]
But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow, we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

There are nights when I lay wide awake thinking of how good it could be
Other nights I don't feel worthy of the love you gave to me
I remember not too long ago we both were here to stay
But it seems it happened overnight when I threw it all away
I can walk away and find somebody new

[Chorus:]
But I can't forget you, can't break free
I only have myself to blame, nothing feels the same without you
Can't you see, we can find tomorrow, we lost yesterday
We lost yesterday

Hope that I can make you love me once again

But now you're all I have too inside
You want the best of my love

I feel when you're there

Facing what we feel inside
Ready to stand the test of time

And felt the kiss that
Makes me love you
Enough to see us through

It took sometime to feel
The way I feel
That's why I know I'm here forever
And you will always be there

To keep away from the thoughts
That we share
Is to feel the pain that I feel

Never wanted to see you cry

Cause if love means war, baby I surrender

You use words as weapons I use love as a shield
So tell me why are we on this battlefield
In a blaze of glory can we rise above these flames
In a world of anger there's got to be a way

Sometimes we raise our guns of pain but I'll be your defender
Cause if love means war, baby I surrender
We're just soldiers from the heart and I ain't no pretender
So lay down your arms and baby let's surrender

And thought my aim is true
I sometimes miss the mark

To the back you'll be sportin' the gear; is that coincidental?
Act like you know and don't be claiming that it's mental
Two lil' kids with a flow you ain't ever heard
And nuthin' fake and you can understand every word (Word, hahaha)
As you listen to my cool, smooth melody
The Daddy makes you J-U-M-P

Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am together we cry

[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie

I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love take me all the way

Yeah, yeah yeah

At least I have her love

204,1992,Sir Mix-A-Lot,Baby Got Back,"[Intro: Girls]
""Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!

[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!"
205,1992,Joe Public,Live And Learn,"[Chorus]
You've got to live and learn
You've got to live and learn
Before your bridges burn
You've got to live and learn

Here's a little story about life
Everybody that lives surely dies
A lot of people ask the questions why
Some people have to go through so much more
Before they really learn about life's score
The subject is not to be ignored (Kick it to 'em, Joe)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be the one
To tell you how it's gotta be
Livin' is the only way
You're ever really gonna see

[Chorus]

Ah, yeah
Y'all, check it
Kick this one for the Public
Now break it down

There's so much wrong and negativity
Enough for the whole world to see
I know there's still a possibility
You raise a little kid, he turns out bold
It may be from the way you treat him cold
I guess that's how the story's told (Tell 'em what it is)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus Alt.]
You've got to live and learn
(I don't wanna be the one)
You've got to live and learn
(To tell you how it's gotta be)
Before your bridges burn
(Livin' is the only way)
You've got to live and learn
(That you're ever gonna see)

(Large) If large is how ya livin'
Why you're livin' large, are you takin' what is given
To you, in the form of true experience
'Cause if you're not your whole life could be spent
Doin' time for a crime you say you didn't even do
The only fool that you're foolin' is the fool that is you
Didn't even turn around to check and see if your bridge is burnin'
I guess it's true what they say that without livin' there's no learnin'

And this is from the J, the O, and the E

Mary, Mary, Mary, it's quite contrary
Yo', how did you earn your dough
You didn't finish school, you ain't got no job
But to the human eye it's pretty simple
You're always talkin' about what you want is respect
But never thinkin' about the little boy you neglect
Spendin' his formative years in a livin' hell
Not realizin' one day he'd end up in jail

Now on the other hand
There's Dan my man
Who planned a scam and I'll be damned
It was the ultimate flim flam
He was sayin' that it was easy as pie
But little did Dan know he was about to die

[Chorus Alt.]

Give you everything you need
To live inside a twisted cage
Sleep beside an empty rage
I had a dream I was your hero

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'd rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed

Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm

You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

[Bridge]
If I was your girl believe me
I'd turn on the Rolling Stones
We could groove along and feel much better
Let me in
I could do it forever and ever and ever and ever
Give me an hour to kiss you
Walk through heaven's door I'm sure
We don't need no doctor to feel much better
Let me in
Forever and ever and ever and ever

[Verse 3]
I sat on the mountainside with peace of mind
I lay by the ocean making love to her with visions clear
Walked for days with no one near
And I return as chained and bound to you

[Chorus]
Damn I wish I was your lover
I'll rock you till the daylight comes
Make sure you are smiling and warm
I am everything
Tonight I'll be your mother
I'll do such things to ease your pain
Free your mind and you won't feel ashamed
Shucks

You're the only shoe that fits
I can't imagine I'll grow out of it
Damn I wish I was your lover

Open up, I wanna gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
Damn I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on a subway
And I'm comin' uptown
Damn I wish I was your lover
Standin' on a street corner
Waitin' for my luck to change
Damn I wish I was your lover
Feelin' like a schoolboy
Too shy and too young, ohh
Damn I wish I was your lover
Open up, I wanna gonna come inside
I wanna fill you up, I wanna make you cry
Damn I wish I was your lover
Gettin' on my camel
Gonna ride it uptown, oooh
Damn I wish I was your lover
Hangin' around this jungle

Realize the realism of reality treats us both the same

Left Eye don't mean the rest of my body is irrelevant

210,1992,Arrested Development,Tennessee,"[Verse 1: Speech]
Lord, I've really been real stressed
Down and out, losing ground
Although I am Black and proud
Problems got me pessimistic
Brothers and sisters keep messin' up
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
I don't know where I can go
To let these ghosts out of my skull
My grandma's passed, my brother's gone
I never at once felt so alone
I know you're supposed to be my steering wheel
Not just my spare tire (home)
But Lord I ask you (home)
To be my guiding force and truth (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Verse 2: Speech]
Lord it's obvious we got a relationship
Talking to each other every night and day
Although you're superior over me
We talk to each other in a friendship way
Then outta nowhere you tell me to break
Outta the country and into more country
Past Dyersburg into Ripley
Where the ghost of childhood haunts me
Walk the roads my forefathers walked
Climbed the trees my forefathers hung from
Ask those trees for all their wisdom
They tell me my ears are so young (home)
Go back to from whence you came (home)
My family tree, my family name (home)
For some strange reason it had to be (home)
He guided me to Tennessee (home)

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Interlude: Aerle Taree]
Eshe, she went down to Holly Springs
Rasadon and Baba, they went down to Peachtree
Headliner, I challenge you to a game of horseshoes, a game of horseshoes

[Verse 3: Speech]
Now I see the importance of history
Why my people be in the mess that they be
Many journeys to freedom made in vain
By brothers on the corner playing ghetto games
I ask you Lord why you enlightened me
Without the enlightenment of all my folks
He said cause I set myself on a quest for truth
And he was there to quench my thirst
But I am still thirsty
The Lord allowed me to drink some more
He said what I am searching for are
The answers to all which are in front of me
The ultimate truth started to get blurry
For some strange reason it had to be
It was all a dream about Tennessee

[Chorus]
Take me to another place
Take me to another land
Make me forget all that hurts me
Let me understand your plan

[Outro: Aerle Taree]
Headliner, I won the game of horseshoes
Now you owe me a watermelon
Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks
Do like they do below the border
Speech's hair
Don't it look like the roots of the tree that the ancestors were hung from
But that's okay, get it cause he's down to Earth"
211,1992,Billy Ray Cyrus,Achy Breaky Heart,"[Verse 1]
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes when I'm gone
Or you can tell your friends just what a fool I've been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Verse 2]
You can tell your ma I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not okay
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today

[Chorus]
But don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart, my achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man, ooh-ooh

212,1992,Vanessa Williams,Save The Best For Last,"[Verse 1]
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

[Chorus]
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Verse 2]
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

[Chorus]
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Bridge]
Sometimes the very thing
You're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last"

Somewhere deep inside

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me

He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Look again cause I ain't wearing no frown

Well, I don't really care about your sister
Forget the little bitch, cause I already kissed her
One thing that I did to your lady
I put her on the bed and she didn't say maybe

I know you know everybody knows
The way it comes, the way it's gonna go
You think it's sad
Well that's too bad

I can't imagine living my life after you're gone
Wondering why so many questions have no answers
I keep on searching for the reason why we went wrong

Where is our yesterday
You and I could use it right now
But if this is goodbye...

Just take my heart when you go
I don't have the need for it anymore
I'll always love you, but you're too hard to hold
Just take my heart when you go

Here we are about to take the final step now
I just can't fool myself, I know there's no turning back
Face to face it's been an endless conversation
But when the love is gone you're left with nothing but talk

I'd give my everything
If only I could turn you around
But if this is goodbye...

[Verse 1]
I'm your average ordinary everyday kid
Happy to do nothing, in fact that's what I did
I got a million ways to make my day but daddy don't agree
Because when I try to get away, he says, he got plans for me
""Get your butt right out of bed""
Stop bugging me
""Get up and move your sleepy head""
Don't shake my tree
He said, ""Mow the lawn"", who me?
""Walk the dog"", not my style, man
""Take out the trash"", no way
""Tidy your room"", come on, get real
Sorry Dad, got to disappear
Let's get the rock out of here

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long
So get on in it, come on, come on, come on

I'm your average ordinary everyday dude
Driving with my baby to get her in the mood
She's dialing through my radio and I'm ready to make my move
What she got ain't rock 'n' roll and it really blew my groove
It was Chopin, Mozart, Beethoven
It makes me want to scream
Bach, Tchaikovsky, violins
Turn it off, that ain't my scene
Well, I'm sorry, girl, here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question

Seven day weekend, up all night
In at the deep end, hang on tight
It won't take a minute, it won't take long

Hey, all I want to do is take a ride into the blue
Every time I want to love you, I get stuck inside my room
Heaven knows I'm sick and tired of dancing with this broom
I feel lucky today
Hey, look at that, man
Do you want to get rocked?
Do you want to get rocked?
Ho, it won't take you a minute
It won't take that long
So get on, get with it
Oh, come on everybody

Let's get, let's get, let's get, let's get rocked
Get on top of it

That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it
I'm gonna have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
I've got no choice but to face it
I have to let you know that I don't like it
My love is good for someone
And it may take some time
But I will find him
Why should I waste it?
When I go
When I go
When I go on
I will go on
You won't see me cry
You know I decided
That I'm gonna pull myself together
And find a way to fight it, oh no
Even if I have to hide it
You won't see me cry
You won't see me cry
You won't see me
I finally decided
And I found the way to fight it
So you won't see me cry
You won't see me cry"

Down a street far away
And see a face in the crowd and smile
Knowing how you made me laugh
Hearing sweet echoes of you from the past
I will remember you

Look in my eyes while you're near
Tell me what's happening here
See that I don't want to say good-bye
Our love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember, I will remember you

Later on
When this fire is an ember
Later on
When the night's not so tender
Given time
Though it's hard to remember darlin'
I will be holding
I'll still be holding to you
I will remember you

So many years come and gone
And yet the memory is strong
One word we never could learn
Good-bye
True love is frozen in time
I'll be your champion and you will be mine
I will remember you
So please remember
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you
I will remember you"

Been watching you baby
For a long time
You look so good
Got my eyes on you
I've been watching you
For so very long
Trying to get my nerve built up to be so strong
I really want to meet you
But I'm kind of scared
Cause you're the kind of lady
With so much class
Get my thoughts together
For the very next day
But when I see you lady
I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair
Such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk
It really turns me on
Ooh, you really turn me on
Ooh, you really turn me on
Come on, come on, come on

There you are again
With the same smile each day
I wanna know what it is
That makes me feel this way
I wish I could grab you
Tell you what it means to me
To see you walking by my way
It really makes my day
Before I go to sleep and dream about you
I'm a single man
I hope that you are single too
Why do I seek
Something to set my mind free
Cause curiosity is bugging
The hell outta me
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me, baby

227,1992,Richard Marx,Hazard,"[Verse 1]
My mother came to Hazard when I was just seven
Even then the folks in town said with prejudiced eyes
That boy's not right

Three years ago when I came in on Mary
First time that someone looked beyond the rumors and the lies
Saw the man inside

[Chorus 1]
We used to walk down by the river
She loved to watch the sun go down
We used to walk along the river
And dream our way out of this town

[Verse 2]
No one understood what I felt for Mary
No one cared until the night she went out walking all alone
And never came home

Man with a badge came knocking next morning
Here was I surrounded by a thousand fingers suddenly
Pointed right at me

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town

[Bridge]
I think about my life gone by
How it's done me wrong
There's no escape for me this time
All of my rescues are gone, long gone

[Chorus 2]
I swear I left her by the river
I swear I left her safe and sound
I need to make it to the river
And leave this old Nebraska town"

229,1992,Mariah Carey,Make It Happen,"[Verse 1]
Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

[Chorus]
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen

He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

[Interlude]
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way

And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night

I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go

When there's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore
We won't hesitate, break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today

From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down, get back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in

Feelin that I'd always be the lonely one
Then I saw your face, on the edge of my horizon
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one

One change intervention, see what it can signify
The slightest misapprehension, baby
And we'd have passed each other by
When I heard your sweet voice callin
Saw your light come shinin throught
I couldn't stop my heart from turning
Churnin out my love for you, my love to you

True love or perfection
It seems like it's overdue
Then just when you least expect it
It comes sneakin up on you
When I thought that I was dreamin
Felt your body close to mine
Now love takes on a different meaning
Together till the end of time

I was in a daze, movin in the wrong direction
Feeling that I'd always be the lonely one
When I saw your face through the web of my confusion
Whisperin that I wasn't the only one
The lonely one"

A simple touch of your hand
And everything is right
The gentle way you look at me
When we kiss goodnight

You've given me the freedom
No other love has known
And now I thank you, girl
Thank you, girl

The countless ways
You've touched my heart
Is more than I can say
The beauty that you've shown to me
Takes my breath away

A picture perfect painting
That's what our love is
And, yes I need you so
And now I know

[Chorus:]
I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art
It's true
And I treasure you, my love

I've found a masterpiece in you
A work of art
It's true
And I treasure you

Sometimes I wonder
What I'd be
Had I not found you

A least and lonely soul
This world could show
Me nothing new

But now my life's a canvas
Painted with your love
And it will always be
And now I see

The gentle walks together
Through time
We'll never part
This fairy tale
We shared is real inside our hearts

Let it be forever
Never let it end
This promise
I can make
Heaven is ours to take

[Repeat Chorus:]

When I'm lost and insecure
You build me up
And make me sure
That everything will be all right

Please, never let it end

As high as I might, I can't get that high
The how you move, the way you burst the clouds
It makes me want to try
And when I see you sticky as lips
As licky as trips, I can't lick that far
But when you pout, the way you shout out loud
It makes me want to start
And when I see you happy as a girl
That swims in a world of a magic show
It makes me bite my fingers through
To think I could've let you go

And when I see you take the same sweet steps
You used to take, I say
""I'll keep on holding you in my arms so tight
I'll never let you slip away""

Yeah, as smitten as that, I can't get that small

That lives in a world of make believe
It makes me pull my hair all out

You broke my heart

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
Check this out, honey
It seems like 99 years have gone by
Since the last time I talked to you, you know
I never realized that somethin' so innocent and so sweet
Could make a man feel so much pain
Times you'd jump out of my car
And I'd chase you till I was out of breath
Go to your job and pick you up
But you never showed up that day (Where were you baby)
Where were you, baby (Where were you)
Who was you seein', it's a hurtin' feelin', sugar
How could you, why would you abuse my love, sweetheart
Cursin' me out in front of my friends
And I could never do anything to you
Cause there was no way I could hurt somethin' (Nothing to you baby)
(Nothing to you baby)
I treasured so much
Thought I was right on time, but it seems like I was too late (No)
You hurt me, baby (No)
But hey, I'm man enough to admit it (No)
What I wanna know is why (No baby)

Yo, the way it happened was crazy (Umm)
We had a argument (Umm)
I didn't see you for two or three days
And then when I go to the movies to get you off my mind (Off my mind)
I see you sittin' there holdin' hands with the next man
Caught you on the phone a couple of times, but it was always your cousin
(You lie) Step off, just a friend (You used to lie to me baby)
People used to tell me, ""L, she was fakin'""
But I couldn't see it, I was blinded by love (Got nothing on me baby)
Nothin' was too expensive
No night was too rainy
I was always there for you (I did everything baby)
I did things few call me a fool for doin'
Droppin' your friends off, all that
All I wanted in return was your undivided attention and love
(I need love baby)
If my heart had eyes it would cry
You're still in my world (Ooh you're still in my world)
Life is worth livin' love
Tell me why

Do another day gets nothin'
Am I goin' crazy, baby

And think about the moment, yeah, yeah
About each other

There's a right and a wrong way to love somebody
I'll always give all my love to you

That the laws behind my Lam', think they could catch me
I think not, I'ma mash to the spot
Turning corners hitting blocks, got the sturning wheel hot
Alright catch a flight, hot-lanta next night
Looking for some fire green, the price is right

Home of the piece and chain, diamond teeth and thangs
Home of the pinky rings, and the raw cocaine

If I were a sculptor, but then again no
Or a man who sells potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world

I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of those verses, you know what, make me cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote down this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting, but these things that I do
You see I've forgotten, if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is, what I, what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

And you can tell everybody, this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind

If he's a drug dealer
Don't you know that he won't last forever?
And you need the affections of a normal man

And when I see your name
I swear, I hear the wind blow
It drives me insane
I'll never let you go (never let you go)
And I start to laugh 'cause I'm so afraid of crying
And I'm dying to see you once more

'Cause I need you

Whenever she's around
My whole world starts coming down
And I lose control
When she's away I began to miss her
She holds me close and I can't resist her
She kisses me on the lips
Walks away and wiggles her hips
And I lose control
Gotta have that girl, she's all I ever wanted

Don't tell your man
I got a plan
So understand that I can never be the type of guy
That will try to make you cry _______?
_______? were never true to take the blame
So I will make your mine, don't look behind
In time the thing will fit the crime
Like they say, what comes around goes around
And brings you down

Maria, yeah some place for us
Maria, somewhere a place for us
Together we will be, until eternity
Somewhere out there, I've got to make you mine
Tonight in the corners of my lonely room
I pray for your salvation, rehabilitation
And I pray to the lord above to forever bring me love
And as I fall asleep to dream once more
I have to make you mine

Maria
The most beautiful sound I ever heard
Maria
Don't tell your boyfriend how I feel about you
'Cause I need you
And I gotta make you mine
I've got to make you mine"

Rarely seen and never heard
Emotion
Bare your soul you'll never learn

But don't ask why
And you won't get lied to
Speak to them softly
It's something you get used to

You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away

I found her
All alone lost in a crowd
When she saw me
I felt so much I cried aloud

She turned away
I couldn't speak to stop her
The only sound I heard
Was the echo of her laughter

You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me
The things she said, the books she read
The way she looked when the morning came
The time of night that you held her tight
But you'll never forget the day she ran away

You think you know her
But you never really
Lived a life without her
You couldn't tell me

261,1992,Chris Walker,Take Time,"Got a ride with my friends, still don't have a car
Dropped off while they hit the mall
Really caught my eyes from afar
Looked away, no high's worth the fall
I ain't tripping. Then I heard her talk. Sounded smart
She on my radar like sonar
Got me thinking what's a movie without a co-star?
Just know that I'll only go so far
Cuz sin dangerous, can't afford a close call
So before I approached had caution
Friend zone like a dead zone, Chris Walken
Cuz guys want the end-zone early like the Falcons
I only want the ring like there's 12 on my back
I'm tryna win the game fair, that's my plan of attack
We both got a past, but we can't take it back
What's the point in fast if it don't last?
Got questions but perhaps it's your name I should ask. Hey

(Chorus)
I know that the feeling is right, and I don't ever want you to leave me
Just know that we can't do it twice, it twice
Your friends all give you advice, but do you believe me?
Cuz I don't want it just for tonight. Tonight. Oh I

From a distance hard to read your intentions
So I stayed away, found an exit in case
This building set fire. She thinking, you're crazy
Word to Mali, it gets hard little lady
Wanna know your goals, do you got ambition?
Say you wash dishes tryna pay off tuition
Like to stay home, do you go to church?
Nowadays everybody christian but their timeline isn't
Friends don't connect if the wifi's missing
Are you not afraid to speak but prefer to listen?
Need the type of girl to enrich me
Do you prefer the broke me or the rich me?
Not that I'm getting paid
Some want you making change; girl I'm tryna make a change. Can you relate?
Would you see me different if you saw me on stage?
If I dont ever make it would you look at me the same? Dang
Girl just went and got her nails and her hair did
Come closer, let me share what them nails did
Got them thick curls
Want a man that can give the whole world
Can't guarentee yet, yeah I'll say it polite
Nah I ain't tryna stay for the night
Let me take it slow, get it right
If you wanna be mine, then I'm digging for the diamonds in your mind
AO

(Chorus)

We still talking, can't help but feel amazing
It's crazy what you find when you're not chasing
Can't even lie my heart racing
She hide her body, but her conversation enough to fascinate me
As my mind on her eyes. A vibration rings loud
My ride. Says it's time, bout to meet you outside
I text back, did you really have to pull up right now?
Apologize and say it's nice to meet her. She just smiles
Figure I should ask if I could write her number down
She frowned and said, sorry I don't really give that out
Deflated. Stupid thinking she would take the time
Turn to leave 'til she says, Wait, never mind
Could she be the one? Only time will tell
Is it God's will? Pray that I'm prepared
Wish I could tell her how I feel, and how well the night went
If we ever fall in love, give my life, thats a price well spent
Forget a night, she the type to spend your life with
Tell my homie and he say her reputation straight
She nice and her faith strong. She don't ever fake
Can't believe, stumbled on a girl with the right traits
As the car drives further I can barely feel the brakes
All of a sudden, somewhere my body seems to shake
As I wake, reach my alarm, it's 8:15
Dawg I really can't believe it was a dream
Girl of my dreams

How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done?
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Hey, this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut?
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth

[Chorus]
Tell me
Why?
Why?

[Verse 2]
I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides, why can't you see this boat is sinking?
This boat is sinking (this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out
Turning inside out

Tell me
Why?
Tell me
Why?

(Why?) This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
(Why?) This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears, the tears we shed
This is the fear, this is the dread
These are the contents of my head
(Why?) And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you how I feel
I don't think you know what I fear
(Why?) I don't think you know what I fear
You don't know what I fear"

Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
Sometimes I rhyme slow sometimes I rhyme quick
I'm sweeter and thicker than a Chick-O-Stick
Here's an ice cream cone honey take a lick
Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine
He say, she say, I heard it through the grapevine
No static, got an automatic
Too much of anything makes you an addict
Teasin, skeezin, all so pleasin
Don't ask why I got my own reasons

Sometimes I rhyme slow
Sometimes I rhyme quick
I was on 125 and Saint Nick
Waiting on a cab, standing in the rain
Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know

269,1992,Laura Enea,This Is The Last Time,"I was such a fool
Hopelessly in love with you
You were so cruel
For what you put me through

So now I'm telling you goodbye
There's no way to stop me, don't even try
I'm not the same girl I was yesterday
Forget the past and let the memories fade away

This is the last time you'll break my heart
I'm doing what I should've done from the start
This is the last time, no more second chances
And now you'll never know what true romance is

I've opened my eyes
I know you've done me wrong
I said that I loved you
And you just played along

All of those times I begged you to stay
But you just walked away

That was the last time you made me cry
Baby, we're through, I'm telling you goodbye

270,1992,Giggles,What Goes Around Comes Around,"You came into my life and said you'd give me love
You promised I would never hurt again
I believed your words
I had trust in you
I was just a fool
Your love was never true

But no more tears will be shed from my eyes anymore
I know I'll be strong and you will be gone
These silly games will end
You'll never break my heart again
Tell him why girlfriend

'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me
Will come back to you
'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me
Will come back to you someday

You had something really good and then you let it go
And now you say you want me here to hold
Are you blind to see
We will never be
So don't you think about coming back to me

I gave you all the love a man would ever need
But then you did me wrong
With you I don't belong
Now I'll get over you
But someday you will get yours too
Tell him why girlfriend

'Cause what goes around, comes around

Some of the pain that you have caused me
Will come back to you

Some of the pain that you have caused me
Will come back to you someday

What goes around, comes around
That's not a fiction, that's a fact
Some men think they got it like that
Women like me you better respect
If you don't I'll put you in check
I've been hurt so many times before
I'm not gonna take this anymore
Sorry, Charlie I'm out the door

Woman, what's wrong with you
Saying that my love was never true
You just wanted me for my money
Now I know you're someone else's honey
You spread rumours all around town
Talking about what goes around, comes around
You better think before you speak
Don't go putting the blame on me

Tell him why, girlfriend

'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me
Will come back to you
'Cause what goes around, comes around
That's what people say
Some of the pain that you have caused me

272,1992,Black Sheep,The Choice Is Yours,"[Intro]
Oh, Yeah! Yeah, baby!
That's it, that's it!
I'm working with that

[Verse 1]
Who's the Black Sheep? What's the Black Sheep?
Know not who I am, or when I'm coming, so you sleep
Was it in your room, or was it in your sphere?
Knew not who I was, but listen here
Dres, D-R-E-S, yes I get suckers start
If it's all right with you, I'll rip this here one apart
Back, middle, to the front, don't front
Wanna a good time, gonna give you what you want
Can I hear a hey? (Hey!)
Now get a yo! (Yo!)
You got a hey? (Huh!)
It's for the hoes (Oh!)
The styling is creative, Black Sheep of the Native
Can't be violated, or even decepticated
I got brothers in the Jungle, cousins on the Quest
Deaf, retarded uncles, in parties where they rest
Guess, which way, what, when, how
Mista Lawnge, Dres, Black Sheep slam now
Know you've heard the others, phonies to the lovers
Then of course, the choice is yours

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

[Verse 2]
Where's the Black Sheep? Here's the Black Sheep
Even if we wanted to, the flock could not be weak
Watch me swing like this, why should I swing it like that?
Because, in fact, on me, it might not attract
Therefore, I ignore, do as I feel inside
I live with me, I've got my back tonight
Y'know what I'm saying?
Yo, Black, I'm not playing
Need to go with this or go with this with no delaying
See, in actuality, one day can it be
I made it look easy because it is to me
Anytime capacity was filled, try to rock it
Anytime a honey gave us play, tried to knock it
Never was a fool, so we finished school
Never see us sweat and you'll never see us drool
Out to rock the globe while it's still here to rock
Don't punch girls and we don't punch a clock
Gotta go, gotta go, see you later by the cat
And you can't beat that with a bat

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

[Verse 3]
Now you can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, yes, for this is kind of phat
If you get with that, then you will surely miss
Because that is so wack, I think you'll get with this
For in the day in my life, or rather the life through my days
Never sweat the chaos, for a Balck Sheep has ways
Although, how shall I say it? Take a point, convey it
Styling is quite Dolby, yes, I know those for you play
Not to be all that, thought all that is my goal
Stumble and fell, brother, like Dres would roll
Need a sexy honey for a twilight stroll
Gave up on sushi, give me an egg roll
At A&W, get to the Root, with a boot or sneaker
Get near a speaker, demo to a single
To the kind with fly hoe, damned the scenario
And pass a plate or cross the fader
Black Sheep getting played, like a Sony Innovator
Dres, the creator of a style that is much greater

[Hook]
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
You can get with this, or you can get with that
I think you'll get with this, for this is where it's at, where it's at

I pray my Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray my Lord my soul to take

Don’t be afraid, baby
When you start to scratch and moan
And your problems are long gone
Let it happen right now
Don’t be afraid, girl

Now I have you all to myself
You can put all the other guys all on the shelf
No need to run and no need to hide
All the doors are locked baby and I have you inside
You can yell and you can hit me
It just makes me horny
Ain’t nothing but a love thing baby
Between me and you
So just give in baby, don’t worry about a thing

Don’t be afraid

Deep down, feel so lucky girl to have you in my arms
But now its time to go baby, need for an alarm
Go to sleep my baby, like i said everythings alright
Rest your head on my tattooed my chest
I know it feels real good
Oohwee baby, no need to be afraid
The lights are off and I open the sheets
So kiss me baby, Say it so one more time
For the road baby, I’m right again
Give me the center baby don’t be afraid

Don’t be a-
Don’t be a-
Don’t be afraid (repeat over until fade)"

Doctor: Nurse Johnson, is the mother still in the recovery room?
Nurse: Yes, Dr. Blair
Doctor: OK, I'll go to the waiting room and inform the father it's a boy
Nurse: I'm afraid there is no father, sir
Doctor: Another ghetto bastard, huh?

Doctor: Well, put him with the rest of the born losers
Nurse: All right doctor, a shame isn't it?

Who waited for the worst, cause the best lived 'cross town

Everything's gonna be alright now (alright)
Everything's gonna be alright (alright)

[Verse 1: Treach]
Some get a little and some get none
Some catch a bad one and some leave the job half done
I was one who never had and always mad
Never knew my dad, motherfuck the fag
Well anyway, I did pick ups, lift and click-ups
Too many stick-ups, cause niggas had the trigger hiccups
I couldn't get a job, nappy hair was not allowed
My mother couldn't afford us all, she had to throw me out
I walked the strip with just a clip, who wanna hit
They got 'em quick, I had to eat, this money's good as spent
A 'do in braids, I wasn't paid enough
I kept 'em long cause I couldn't afford a haircut
I got laughed at, I got chumped, I got dissed
I got upset, I got a Tec and a banana clip
Was down to throw the lead to any telling crackhead
I'd still'a been broke, so a lot of good it woulda did
Or done, if not for bad luck, I would have none
Why did I have to live a life of such a bad one
Why when I was a kid and played I was a sad one
And always wanted to live like this or that one

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Treach]
A ghetto bastard, born next to the projects
Living in the slums with bums, I said, ""now why, Treach""
""Do it have to be like this""
Momma said I'm priceless
So I am all worthless, starved, and it's just what being nice gets
Sometimes I wish I could afford a pistol then, though
To stop the hell, I would've ended things a while ago
I ain't have jack but a black hat and knapsack
War scars, stolen cars, and a blackjack
Drop that, and now you want me to rap and give?
Say something positive?
Well positive ain't where I live
I live right around the corner from West Hell
Two blocks from South Shit and once in a jail cell
The sun never shone on my side of the street, see
And only once or twice a week I would speak
I walked alone, my state of mind was home sweet home
I couldn't keep a girl, they wanted kids with cars and chrome
Some life, if you ain't wear gold your style was old
And you got more juice and dough for every bottle sold
Hell no, I say there's gotta be a better way
But hey, never gamble in a game that you can't play
I'm slowin' and flowin' and going in on and knowing not now
How will I do it, how will I make it
I won't, that's how
Why me, huh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Treach]
My third year into adulthood, and still a knucklehead
I'm better off dead huh, that's what my neighbor said
I don't do jack but fighting, lightin' up the streets at night
Playing hide-and-seek with a machete sexing Freddy's wife
Some say I'm rolling on, nothing but a dog now
I answer that with a ""fuck you"" and a bow-wow
Cause I done been through more shit within the last week
Than a fly flowing in doo-doo on the concrete
I been a deadbeat, dead to the world and dead wrong
Since I was born that's my life, oh you don't know this song
So don't say jack, and please don't say you understand
All that man-to-man talk can walk, damn
If you ain't live it, you couldn't feel it, so kill it, skillet
And all that talk about it won't help it out, now will it?
In Illtown, pure luck got stuck-up, props got shot
Don't worry got hit by a flurry, and his punk-ass dropped
But I'm the one who has been labeled as an outcast
They teach in schools, I'm the misfit y'all will outlast
But that's cool with the fool, smack 'em backwards
That's what you get for fucking with a ghetto bastard

[Outro]
If you ain't ever been to the ghetto
Don't ever come to the ghetto
Cause you wouldn't understand the ghetto
And stay the fuck out of the ghetto
Why me (alright)"
276,1992,Lisa Stansfield,All Woman,"He's home again from another day
She smiles at him as he walks through the door
She wonders if it will be okay
It's hard for her when he doesn't respond

He says babe you look a mess
You look dowdy in that dress
It's just not like it used to be
Then she says...

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

She stands there and lets the tears flow
Tears that she's been holding back so long
She wonders where did all the loving go
The love they used to share when they were strong

She says yes I look a mess
But I don't love you any less
I thought you always thought enough of me to always be impressed

I may not be a lady
But I'm all woman
From monday to sunday I work harder than you know
I'm no classy lady
But I'm all woman
And this woman needs a little love to make her strong
You're not the only one

He holds her and hangs his head in shame
He doesn't see her like he used to do
He's too wrapped up in working for his pay
He hasn't seen the pain he's put her through

Attention that he paid
Just vanished in the haze
He remembers how it used to be
When he used to say

You'll always be a lady
'Cos you're all woman
From monday to sunday I love you much more than you know
You're a classy lady
'Cos you're all woman
This woman needs a loving man to keep her warm

You're the only one
You're a classy lady
'Cos you're all woman

So sweet the love that used to be
So sweet the love that used to be

We can be sweet again..."

If you wanna trip let me know
Ain't got no time for no hoochie games
Just jump out the panties, don't feel no shame

And when I stick it to you, girl, you'll be happy

Yo, it ain't the length or the width, it's the way I work it
And like D said, girl, I'ma jerk, jerk, jerk it
Make you good 'til you curl up your toes
Knock the rollers out your hair 'til they fall on the floor
I was built for war not peace
And what I mean by war means tearing some sheets
And some spreads in the bed
I'll knock headboards until your clear stuff turns red
I'll make you flip, have a fit, while I’m making you moan and kick
Looka here, trick
Now I'm holding genuine beef, but you don't need teeth
All you need is strong knees

Now come on, lay down
Your butt is nice and round
Now don't interrupt
Because it's time to…

Step up, baby, and get tag teamed
Young hoochies, we love coochies
If we want it, let us up on it

When I first saw your man, he was really fine, he had a natural shake, it was so devine, he had a red mercedes benz that was drop down low, gold pin stripe it was good to go, it had a gucci rad top, with a system that thumped 30 foot ___ w/ a boom in the trunk, he kissed me on the cheek, and you know that's all he got, now he calls me everyday saying ""I like you a lot""

Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man

Ohhh gurl u know i love ya
Ohhh gurl u know i love ya
Ohhh gurl u know i love ya
Ohhh gurl u know i love ya

Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man

If you got a boyfreidn, you better hold on tight, and keep him in sight every single night, cause when I got out, I look so fine, cause i'm dressed to impress, and I'm one of a kind, I take him, shake him, work him on out, show your man what I'm all about, so when he tells you it's the end, that's when you know I got your boyfriend

Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man
Boom! I got your boyfriend, I got your man"

James Brown is dead
James Brown is dead
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)

[Verse 1]
Mass hysteria, this is techno
House is not my home, but it rocks though
I checked up on the late great J.B
His death is said on national TV
How, when, and why these are the
Main things that I heard when I stroll down the lane
Of memory? Man, are you with that?
James Brown is dead

[Hook]
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)
(Now hear thi-- now hear this!)

[Verse 2]
Total chaos, man it's resurrected
I'm confused, that things are gettin' hectic
In my brain, what is happenin'?
Could this be a big misunderstanding?
It is
The hardest working man in show biz is alive so yo bust this
Don't be mislead 'cause the newsman said
James Brown is dead

[Interlude]
James Brown is dead

[Interlude]
James Brown is dead

[Verse 3]
Nightmare is over, now I'm awoke
Grab the mike, rip shit and go for broke
The musical masterpiece release that these
Now I will get much respect from MCs
Arrive the way, cause I heard him say
This is fly, this cool type of guy
He's dope, and oh so bad
James Brown is dead

280,1992,The College Boyz,Victim Of The Ghetto,"[Chorus]
It doesn't seem like
I'll be going nowhere
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
It doesn't seem like I'll be
Getting too far, too far

You know, Tone
It really ain't that bad
Once you understand
The science of this shit
College Boyz coming to you
For the year 2000
Covering all sectors
Of the universe
Creep through the hood
With my drop top
Gangstas on the sidelines
Throwing up nothing
But a peace sign
Brothers on the curb
With the herb
Levis, knee high
O.G's clock as I creep by
Crib to crib
Grown ups to kid's girls I did
They all know me
So the ghetto stays cozy
Fiends and teens
Sport a couple of trophies
One for the dope man
And the other for the homie
The ghetto's a real
Cool place to be fucked up
Sundown to sunup
But that's the way we come up
You talk with the street slang
You ball and you gang bang
That's where the family hangs
So it ain't no thang

[Chorus]
It doesn't seem like
I'll be going nowhere
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
It doesn't seem like I'll be
Getting too far, too far

[Repeat Chorus]
Yeah, it's like a family affair
If you get through
Plenty of old cuts
Say, what's up
Keep your mouth shut, yup
High rollers know me
But they don't own me
(Fuck you)
5-0 might roll through quite slow
Keep the forty in the bag
And throw away the Zig Zag
Waiting for five or six to come
Down goes the sun
So we can run a game of 21
From time to time some busters bring the noise and try to stop me because them cannot relate to the presence of my posse
Call me anything
From a hoodlum to a thug
You can push and you can shove
And I still won't budge

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Won't be getting too far, too far
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Too far, too far, no
Movie stars, yuppies
Macs and politicians
Roll through to get
A nickel or a ten
They know me, I know them
But then again I can't extend
More than I need to
Cause suddenly, they read me
And lead you astray
And transactions completed
Your presence in my ghetto
Ain't needed, so beat it
Born and raised on
The same damn concrete
And I'll be put to sleep
In these streets
I step into a different world
For college education
Keep my safe ways
Pay days stays in effect
I just can't let go
I want my respect so
I gotta return to the
Nation of my ghetto

[Repeat Chorus]
I'm just a victim of the ghetto
Too far, to far
So know you now
College Boyz sending out a fistful
To the Baytown Posse
Concrete Evidence, the CB Posse
My main man, TJ
Omega Psi Phi, Overdose
Suicide, Homicide
DOA and Genocide
And to the law
Keep your ass on the
Other side of the tracks
This is The Q signing out
On radio fusion radio
(Victim of the ghetto)
Checkmate

Tore my heart in two
And now wandering through the night

I'll never be at peace

Love you all my lifetime
Lost to you eternally
Everything in my life
Tells me we were meant to be

Excuses are too late

We goin' take you back a little further
Thinkin' back on you and me
Remembering how it use to be
Those times are precious, I cherish every moment we spent. Yeah!
Thinkin' back on all the arguments
Thinkin' back way back when
We kissed and made up and all was fair in love

So now we gotta go back baby (maybe we can turn the hands of time)
Going back to when (Going back to when you were mine)
When we were one (remembering the times when we were one, one in love)
When love was fun (ohh baby, baby)
Dig it...

Remembering the first time you showed me your love
The feeling was so strong heaven sent from above
But you had no right to play with my heart
You showed no shame
Time after time and place after place
Night after night and day after day
I'm still missing your love and the feelings we share
Sometimes I cry at night coz' I feel so all alone
I need your love right here with me to keep me safe and warm

(maybe we can turn the hands of time)
I'm going back to when (going back to when, when you were mine)
When we were one...we were one girl
Ohh baby girl....

Can I ask you why you’re treating me

You said you'd never leave me
For the rest of my life

I believe you

I don't believe you
So save those words you said to me
And I'll be on my way

I've got a love
That you will never see

Simply because you're oh, so fine

It takes more than looks
To steal my heart away from me

And every time you whisper my name ,I wanna run to you
We'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you, baby
I'm missing you now
Can't wait till I'm alone with you
To show you how I'm missing you now

Wishin' you were here by my side is all that I can do
Got my arms around my pillow at night
They should be holdin' you
Thought I was stronger, how could I know, how could I know
I can't take this much longer, it's so hard on my soul

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
I've gotta be with you, baby
I'm missing you now
Don't know what I'm gonna do
To show the way I'm missing you now

Baby, I just can't wait, till I see your face
Chase away this loneliness inside
When you're close to my heart, right here in my arms
Then and only then will I be satisfied
Missing you now

I know, we'll be together, it won't be long, it won't be long
But it feels like forever and it's hard to be strong

Baby, 'cause I'm missing you now
And it's drivin' me crazy
How I'm needin' you, baby
Can't wait till I'm alone with
To show you how I'm missing you now

287,1992,Salt-N-Pepa,You Showed Me,"You showed me what to do, exactly what to do
When I was in love with you
You showed me many of things, plenty of hard times
Then I got up on it but the hard way
Out there to tax, you chose me to slay
I saw what you did, uh-huh, and said nothin'
But watched, clocked, then I kept bluffin'
And schemed to capture the skill of your rapture
Master become the massa and kick at ya
A plan, a new stand for this woman
Made to be deadly just like the omen
No more trippin', too strong to fall
Shoe's on the other foot, shots are mine to call
Little did you know what you were showing
It hurted when you flirted, but I kept going
Now the student is the teacher, you can't freak her
Play the game of life, and I'll beat ya

You showed me what to do, exactly what to do
When I was in love with you
Ohhh, it's true, I can do it, too
You showed me what to say, exactly what to say
In that very special way
Ohhh, it's true, games were made for two

You're fly, you live high off life riches
Got three, four, and five fly bitches
You dummy, you're so funny, leave me in stitches
Honey, I command, I pull the switches
Now I relieve the scratch when he itches
I'm not the man, but I wear the britches
So pitch your love and lies in the ditches
P.S. hugs and kisses

And when I tried it, I could see you fall
And I decided it wasn't hard at all

You showed me what to say, exactly what to say
In that very special way
Ohhh, it's true, games were made for two
You taught it to me too, exactly what to do
And now I do it well
Ohhh, it's true, now you love me, too

I tried it then I decided it's fun
To catch the wave and ride it
On from what you spawn
Yo, I play like a rose, but I live like a thorn
But anyhow, I do know now the tricks of the trade
I ain't never gettin' played
Say what you will, and do what you must
It all fell apart when you betrayed my trust
Don't worry, babe, you're still my main dish
First on the menu but of a long list
This ain't me, it's what you made me
Now I'm slappin' you back with the same crap you gave me
So get a grip, I'm hipper than hip
And I'm sick and tired of your shit
Let's make this clear, dear, I swear
Never will I get dogged again, I'm outta here

You showed me what to do, exactly what to do
When I was in love with you
Ohhh, it's true, I can do it too
Ohhh, it's true"

Pretty music I hear
So happy and loud

Blue flowers echo
From a cherry cloud

Sparkle pink and blue
Playgrounds will laugh

In her arms over the sea

Down the highway
I’m doing it all my way
Money in my pocket (Yo)
I'll say it feels good
That I got it like that
My top dropped
Her hand is in my lap (my lap)

A child letting go of his kite

There it goes, up in the sky
There it goes, beyond the clouds
For no reason why
I can't cry hard enough
No, I can't cry hard enough

Gonna look back in vain
And see you standing there
When all that remains
Is just an empty chair

And now that you're gone

I stand corrected, how well you read
You speak the truth, you speak to me
You feel the love I have yet to find
I know it's there, I know it's there
But I let the sandcastles kill my mind
Pathetic me, I long to be you
I think I'm close but I stand so far
The turbulent one sheds a turbulent tear
I miss the love only cause they starve
Oil and water, lust and sympathy
I life and death my way through the sun
Where originates all the pain that leaves
My memory a traumatic sponge and sings to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well define my love with attitude
Open up your mind and it will sing to you
You can always tell
But I know remorse so well
I left reality early due to the lack of love, reason

[Chorus]
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I have a love for you that nothing hides
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinking of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes

[Verse 2]
The channel, a professional liar
How I long to contradict those vibes
Joni help me, I think I'm falling
It's not the love and I quest the why
I don't know, If I'm right, I'm right
But if I'm wrong then show me I'm wrong
The fear of pity is always awake
But infinite sympathy's completely gone
It's the windows, the doors
The passageways to the truth
Oh my God, it echoes the mind
In total recall as wild as the deuce
And so deceiving is the clouded heart
So superficial is the open wound
I caress the infinite light
That even at night overshadows the moon that sings to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, define my love, that lives within you
Even when I die, it will sing to you
You can only tell if remorse has done you well
The misconstrued my answers due to the lack of love, reason

[Chorus 2]
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes
Whatever it is I do
I try to think about you
I seek the sympathy and I can't lie
Whatever it is I do
I'm only thinkin' of you
I hope you look at me through patient eyes"

Ahhh... Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
You’ve got to show me love

[Verse 1]
Heartbreaks and promises, I’ve had more than my share
I’m tired of giving my love and getting nowhere, nowhere
What I need is somebody who really cares
I really need a lover, a lover who wants to be there
It’s been so long since I touched a wanting hand
I can’t put my love on the line, that I hope you’ll understand

So baby if you want me
You’ve got to show me love
Words are so easy to say, alright?
You’ve got to show me love

[Verse 2]
I’m tired of getting caught up in those one night affairs
What I really need is somebody who will always be there
Don’t you promise me the world, all that I’ve already heard

If you’re looking for devotion, talk to me
Come with your heart in your hands
Because my love is guaranteed

You’ve got to show me love
There’s only one key to my heart
You’ve got to show me love"

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
Two loced out niggas going crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mac down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down

313,1993,Paperboy,Ditty,"Yo, this is how I'm comin' for the nine deuce
Another phat, phat track, so Rhythm D, pour the orange juice
And let's relax while sippin' on 'gnac because it's like that
I'm cautious of hoes, so Paperboy wears prophylactic
I wear a jimmy for the skinny that's in the long trench
Front row seats, so yo I know she's on the nine inch
Just to get a piece of the green, but she's an undertaker
Not knowin' the paper is a 'round the world heart-breaker
Many say I front, but yo, had to have a break down
Playin' you fools, so now you know why my belly's round
Takin' the rap back up and scoopin' up crowds just like a steel shovel
Not from the ghetto, but yo, take me to another level
Let the beat ride, but hold on to your woman, G
'Cause now that I'm rich so many women wanna do me
It make a man say 'damn'
I'm finally taxin' more than your homey Sam
But let me speak to the weak, I mean the rookies
My time is held up, extremely for cookies
Just let me clock this grip in ninety-two
And you don't bother me and I sure 'nuff won't bother you
And uh, you just watch a brother flowin' like Niagara
Think before you step, because these lyrics just might stag ya
Although I'm labeled with the black fade
It's gold D's on my four and gold 'lex, 'cause I got it made
I broke the veto once again because I had to
And just like Jody Watley, baby girl, I can have you
Just let me work this track, and yo, any way is OK
Your place or mine, all night until the next day, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go from the top, second verse of the same song
With the conclusion, hoes should be happy for the ding-dong
And since a man clock a grip, G
It's like every nigga that I see be like, 'Do you remember me?'
A hustler, and it's known with more hoes than Lego
Keep 'em chunky like Prego, so niggas leggo my Eggo
I have a tendency to flow, start off with my own groove
And pick up the mic, and all of a sudden, I see high movin'
Guess it's like magic, and Paperboy is the magician
If I was a vacuum I'd be suckin' up competition
Let it ride again, and yo, believe I got my own thing
Straight Bahama hoes so miss me with a chick from Soul Train
And I'm a break my note, just to show up tokin'
So hide his eyes when I scoop him, 'cause we bud smokin'
A black man tryin' to make it and that ain't no fair
But just like BeBe and CeCe, I'll take you there, huh

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you

Now here we go, uh, let's take a trip to another land
Clock a grip, come back and watch the hoes tan
Jump in the Lex-o, and roll out to my cabin
Believe me my brother, more hoes than you can imagine
All on the ding-a-ling, just because the gold rings
But I'm like 'What's up with ya? You ain't heard a damn thing'
Make sure you got the jim hats, strapped for protection
Because to me, my life is more than my erection
And give me a hand, if you a fan, it ain't over yet
'Cause doin' the Ditty with Paperboy makes the ocean sweat
Kick the kind of style that knock the funk off of Fritos
Make you man jealous while hoes cheese like Doritos
It ain't my fault, I lay the pipe with concern-and
I ain't from Mount Vernon, but a brother's money-earnin'
And don't disagree and then jock, that's a pity
Just bob your head for Paperboy and the Ditty
Yeah

[Chorus]
Do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
To do the Ditty-Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you
Just do the Ditty if you want to
Because then I can see if I want you"

With all your good time friends
I don't think that you think of me
You're on your own now
And I'm alone and free
I know that I should get on with my life
But a life lived without you could never be right

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

I try to smile so the hurt won't show
Tell everybody
That I was glad to see you go
But the tears just won't go away (won't go away)
Lonliness found me
Looks like it's here to stay
I know that I ought to find someone new
But all I find is myself always thinkin' of you

As long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea
I'll never get over you gettin' over me

Oh... No matter what I do
Each night's a lifetime to live through
I can't go on like this. (I need your touch)
You're the only one I ever loved... oh

And as long as the stars shine down from the heavens
Long as the rivers run to the sea

A tale of three, little pigs
And a big, bad, wolfff

Well the first little piggy, well he was kinda hip
He spent most of his days, just a dreamin of the city
And then one day, he bought a guitar
He moved to Hollywood, to become a star
But, living on the farm, he knew nothing of the city
Built his house out of straw, what a pity
And then one day, jammin on some chords
Along came the wolf, knocking on his door

[Chorus:]
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Little Pig, Little Pig, let me in
Not by the hair of my chinny, chin, chin!!
Well I'm huffin, I'm puffin, I'll blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin, puffin, blow your house in
Huffin and a puffin and I'll blow your house in!!!

Well the second little piggy, well he was kinda stoked
He spent most of his time just a ganga smokin
Huffin and a puffin down on Venice Beach
Getting paid money for religious speech
He built his shelter from what he garbage picked
Mostly made up of old cans and sticks
Then one day he was cranking out Bob Marley
And along came the Wolf on his big bad Harley

[Chorus:]
Well the third little piggy, the grade A student
His daddy was a rock star, named Pig Nugent
Earned his Masters Degree, from Harvard College
Built his house from his architect knowledge
A tri-level mansion, Hollywood Hills
Daddy's rock stardom, paid for the bills
And then one day came the old house smasher
The big bad wolf the little piggy slasher

[Chorus:]
Well the big bad Wolf
Well he huffed, and he puffed, all that he could
And low and behold the little piggy's house stood
""IT'S MADE OUT OF CONCRETE!"" the little piggy shouted
The wolf just frowned, as he pouted
So they called nine-eleven, like any piggy would
The sent out Rambo, just as fast, as they could

(Rambo)
""YO, WOLF-FACE, I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE, YOUR ASS IS MINE!!!""

(gunshots)

Well the wolf fell dead as you can plainly see
So that's to end the story, for you and me
If you still give a listen, you just may, here a big wolf or little piggy
Say

(Chorus [a little different])
"" And the moral of the story is, ' A band with no talent can easily amuse
Idiots, with a stupid, puppet show. """

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee-hee, hee-hee!
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
To me, I'm bothered!

Somebody hurt my soul, now

I can't take it cause I'm lonely

Don't you judge of my composure

'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
(She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter
(She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1]
Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

[Verse 2]
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day

[Verse 3]
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

[Outro]
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?"
329,1993,Bon Jovi,In These Arms,"[Verse 1]
You want commitment
Take a look into these eyes
They burn with fire (yeah)
Until the end of time
And I would do anything
I'd beg, I'd steal, I'd die
To have you in these arms tonight
Baby I want you
Like the roses want the rain
You know I need you
Like a poet needs the pain
And I would give anything
My blood, my love, my life
If you were in these arms tonight

[Chorus]
I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

[Verse 2]
We stared at the sun
And we made a promise
A promise this world would never blind us
And these were our words
Our words were our songs
Our songs are our prayers
These prayers keep me strong
And I still believe
If you were in these arms

[Chorus]
I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

[Verse 3]
Your clothes are still scattered
All over our room
This whole place still smells like
Your cheap perfume
Everything here reminds me of you
And there's nothing
That I wouldn't do
And these were our words
They keep me strong, baby!

[Chorus]
I'd hold you, I'd need you
I'd get down on my knees for you
And make everything alright
If you were in these arms
I'd love you
I'd please you
I'd tell you that I'd never leave you
And love you until the end of time
If you were in these arms tonight

[Outro]
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight
If you were in these arms
Baby
Like the roses need the rain
Like the seasons need to change
Like a poet needs the pain
I need you
In these arms tonight
If you were in these arms tonight"

Give it up for Naughty By Nature!
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho, hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 1: Vinnie]
You drew a picture of my mornin'
But you couldn't make my day (Hey!)
I'm rockin' and you're yawnin'
But you never look my way (Hey!)
I'm lickin' down your darlin'
In every single way (Hey!)
Your funny flow is foreign
And a green card's on the way

[Verse 2: Treach]
This ain't got shit to do with shampoo
But watch your head and shoulder
Brother older, bold enough to fold ya, yo I told ya
A raid afraid of what I made and played it, plus a funky fit
So save yo' flips and tricks for that music and the monkey bit

[Verse 3: Vinnie]
Triggers from the Grilltown Illtown
Some ask how it feels now
The deal is that we're real, so we're still 'round
Don't lamp with a freestyle phantom
Ain't tryin' to be handsome
Shrinkin' what you're thinkin', 'cause I'm vampin'

[Verse 4: Treach]
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop for today
I give props to hip-hop, so Hip Hop hooray

[Hook: Vinnie & Treach]
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 5: Treach]
You heard a lot about a brother gainin' mo' ground
Bein' low down, I do the showdown with any little ho round
No! I wanna know who you believe in
Through your funny reasons
Even when I'm sleepin' you think I'm cheatin'
You said: ""I know you, Mr. O.P.P. man
Yo, PP man, won't only see me man""
You should've known when I ain't hit it and step
That I was wit' it a bit, not to consider the rep, heck!
I did your partner 'cause she's hot as a baker
'Cause I'm Naughty by Nature, not 'cause I hate ya
You put your heart in a part of a part that spreads apart
And forgot that I forgave when you had a spark
You try to act like somethin' really big is missin'
Even though my name's graffiti-written on your kitten
I love black women always and disrespect ain't the way
Let's start a family today; Hip Hop Hooray

[Hook: Vinnie & Treach]
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho
Hip Hop Hooray
Ho, hey, ho
Hey, ho, hey, ho

[Verse 6: Treach]
Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hip Hip Hop, Hooray!
There's many hungry hip-hoppers
One reason Hip Hop's tip-top today
Swerve what you heard 'cause I ain't bailin' no hay
Ain't choppin' no crops, but still growin' every day

[Verse 7: Vinnie]
Here's a thunder sound from the wonders found
From the underground town down the hill
Feel how Illtown drown smiles to frowns
Snatchin' crowns from clowns, beatdowns are found
Don't know me? Don't come around!

[Verse 8: Treach]
Tippy tippy (pause) tippy tippy (pause)
Sometimes creepin' up I eat em up
Your styles are older than Lou Rawls
Peace to this one and that one and them
That way I shout-out and I didn't miss one friend
Fools get foolish, neither them or Parker Lewis knew us
You could have crews with shoes and can't step to us
Some kitties purr, now call me sir too
Lookin' for her crew; any trick that diss gets a curfew
I put on projects for boots
Step through troops and leave proof
My problem solver's name is Mook
I hittin' woodies in a hoodie
Peace to Josette, Jobete, Jo-Jo, Genae, and every hood G
That's right, my fight is ill
Peace goes to L.O.N.S. and Quest
Nice & Smooth and Cypress Hill
I live and die for Hip Hop, this is Hip Hop of today
I give props to Hip Hop, so Hip Hop Hooray

331,1993,Tasmin Archer,Sleeping Satellite,"I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Did we fly to the moon too soon
Did we squander the chance
In the rush of the race
The reason we chase is lost in romance
And still we try
To justify the waste
For a taste of man's greatest adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

Have we lost what it takes to advance?
Have we peaked too soon?
If the world is so green
Then why does it scream under a blue moon
We wonder why
If the earth's sacrificed
For the price of it's greatest treasure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite

And when we shoot for stars
What a giant step
Have we got what it takes
To carry the weight of this concept
Or pass it by like a shot in the dark
Miss the mark with a sense of adventure

I blame you for the moonlit sky
And the dream that died
With the Eagle's flight
I blame you for the moonlit nights
When I wonder why
Are the seas still dry?
Don't blame this sleeping satellite"

Somebody, ooh somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end (of the day)
I take home my hard earned pay all on
My own-I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyesLord

Aw they ain't got no common sense

Got no feel, I got no rhythm

The name and the address
Of everyone I've ever known
It's nothing I regret
Save it for another day
It's the school exam
The kids have run away

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone
Wake up every day, that would be a start
I would not complain of my wounded heart
I was upset, you see
Almost all the time
You used to be a stranger
Now you are mine

[Verse 2]
I wouldn't even trust you
I've not got much to give
We're dealing in the limits
And we don't know who with
You may think that I'm out of hand
That I'm naive, I'll understand
On this occasion it's not true
Look at me, I'm not you

I would like a place I could call my own
Have a conversation on the telephone

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
'Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'
C.L. and Run D.M.C. so rush it
Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it
Remember the faces in all types of places
Look Ma, no shoelaces
And I'm

I'm takin' the tours, I'm wreckin' the land
I keep it hardcore because it's dope man
These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down
Not meant for a ho like a slow jam, check it
Sucka emcees could never swing with D
Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe
My voice is raw, my lyrics is law
I keep it hardcore like you never saw

I went to John Jay University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after twelve grade I went straight to college
Down with the kings on the mic, a full swinger
The P to the R, not an R&B singer
The R to the U-N-D-MC'n
The fly human beings, tonight I hold the key and
Flowin' with the funk track, here to soul brother black
Pick up the bass, better yet leave a space
So let me put my big black twinkie on in to the early mornin'
Had skins yawning'

Too young for this game
On the road to forever we don't know the way

So just forget about eternity
All the promises we just can't keep
Look down any street that's what you'll see

Amazing, outstanding, demanding
Commanding, you people dancing (Whoo)

344,1993,Ugly Kid Joe,Cat's In The Cradle,"[Verse 1]
My child arrived just the other day
Came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
He was talkin' 'fore I knew it
And as he grew, he said
""I'm gonna be like you, Dad""
""You know, I'm gonna be like you""

[Chorus]
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

[Verse 2]
Well, my son turned ten just the other day
He said, ""Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play""
""Could you teach me to throw?"" I said, ""Not today""
""I got a lot to do."" He said, ""That's okay""
And he walked away
And he smiled and he said
""You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah""
""You know I'm gonna be like him""

[Chorus]
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

[Verse 3]
Well, he came from college just the other day
So much like a man, I just had to say
""I'm proud of you, could you sit for a while?""
He shook his head, and he said with a smile
""What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys""
""See you later. Can I have them, please?""

[Chorus]
And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""
""We'll get together then""
""You know we'll have a good time then""

[Verse 4]
I've long since retired, my son's moved away
I called him up just the other day
""I'd like to see you, if you don't mind""
He said, ""I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time""
""You see, my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu""
""But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad, it's been sure nice talkin' to you""
And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me
He'd grown up just like me, my boy was just like me

And the cats in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man on the moon
""When you comin' home?"", ""Son, I don't know when""

Let me see you, put your hood in the air - 2x
If a hater jump up, what we tell him (back-back)
See my click bust first, it ain't no time to (clap back)
See they talking like they killas, but where they (straps at)
This the Dirty South boy, what you know about that

[E.S.G.]
Out the Superbowl city dog, yep ya boy E.S.G
Like a George Foreman grill, man I'm known to cook heat
Spit heat for the street, over crunk beats
Crack my trunk, I crack concrete
All my gangstas bounce with me, blow a hydro ounce with me
Fake gangsta rappers, don't wanna go to war
You dummies might as well and bust, send ya ass to Mars
Better bulletproof your cars, if you running ya mouth
We turn Maybachs to drop tops, with choppers down South
Don't make me knock you cowards out, you be crying like ya gay
You the type, that'll marry Brittany Spears for a day
See plenty of weight, plenty of them rocks
Boys never seen you, on no block
Boys never seen you, pop no Glock
Boys never seen you, dodge no cops

Get caught up, they wind up dead
Running round, like they ain't scared
Boys round here, will bust your head
Like my dog Juve said I need it, I need it in my life
I ain't trying to be Mystikal, and go to jail tonight
Playa pressure bust pipes, and ya pipes bout to bust
I don't care where you from, homie throw your hood up

Like Walter Payton we skating, on black spinners and daytons
Escalade I'm navigating, and to hell with probation
Motivation determination, dedication and paper chasing
I avoid the frustration, and aggravation from the hating
Spit game is my occupation, a thug with a education
Tryna teach to reach my nation, you boys see what we facing
Radio station no rotation, they told me to be patient
How the hell can I keep on waiting, these fakas keep on faking
Fascination with them toys, I love A.K.'s

347,1993,Geto Boys,Six Feet Deep,"There's far too many of you dying

[Verse 1:  Scarface]
June twenty-eight was the date
Thirty-eight to the chest plate
Mommy dear's cryin at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that every day's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember, G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
Never missin out on a hood fight
Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
It's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin was reported on the evenin news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother just can't win
When the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends
Uh, and Bushwick can't sleep
When everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

[Verse 3: Scarface]
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin next to me has snapped a flick
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin all the singin I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into its final song
Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block
And that's deep

[Verse 4: Big Mike]
A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music, so they had to dance
Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it
Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
We used to kick it on the ave at night
Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the chrome
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So long, remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive, real partners come together
And you know that"

Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you

[Pre-Chorus]
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away

[Chorus]
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

[Verse 2]
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here beside the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world

You said you'd always be there
You said you'd always care
You always comfort me
You used to share things with me
You used to have time for me
Now it all seemed to end

[Pre-Chorus: Cindy Herron]
I can't control my fears
Neither hold back tears
Knowing that something's wrong, yeah
The more that I fight with you
The more I realize
It takes more than love
To satisfy my life

Love don't love you, love don't care

Love don't love you, love don't care

I thought I never would see
The day that you and me
Could not communicate
It came to my surprise
The only reason why
We misused the four-letter words

[Pre-Chorus: Cindy Herron]
I should have known the signs
Instead I was blind
Ignoring what people would say
When will I ever learn?
Can't blame it all on one word
Some words can seem more brutal than kind

Love don't love you, love don't care

Love don't love you, love don't care

You see it takes a fool to learn
That love don't love nobody (Got to be you)
But I've learned
That love don't love me
And it sure can't love you (Can only be you, oh)
So what are you gonna do
Don't just say you love me (Baby)
You got to show me (Show me that you care)
So where do we go from here?
Ha, you tell me

You got to show me that you love me
Show me that you care
I need to know that you will always be there, be there
All the love, oh, I'm gonna be there for you
Oh oh oh, yeah, yeah
Love don't love, love don't love no one
And it sure don't care
Love don't love nobody
You should take my advice
Show me that you love me
Show me that you care, baby

That you can't put down at night

And he wasn't afraid to fight
The villain goes to jail, while the hero goes free
I wish it were that simple for me

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew, he just knew

Shadows and shape mixed together at dawn
But by time you catch them simplicity's gonе
And so we sort through the piecеs
My friends and I
Searching through the darkness to find
The breaks in the sky

And the reason that she loved him
Was the reason I loved him too
And he never wondered what was right or wrong
He just knew, he just knew

And we wonder, yes we wonder
How do you make sense of this
When the hero kills the maiden
With his kiss, with his kiss

Well it was one of those great stories
That you can't put down at night

And he wasn't afraid to fight

353,1993,The Pharcyde,Passin' Me By,"[Produced by J-Swift]

[Verse 1: Bootie Brown]
Now in my younger days I used to sport a shag
When I went to school I carried lunch in a bag
With an apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick, to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at 3 o' clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday but still I had to let her pass

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pa--

[Verse 2: SlimKid 3]
When I dream of fairytales I think of me and Shelly
See she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga
But, all I can do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passing me by

[Verse 3: Imani]
Time for me to voice my opinion can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside: she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass I had proved to be a better man

[Chorus]
She keeps on passing me by
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me by
(Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passing me

[Verse 4: Fatlip]
Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by - why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her
And it went, ""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me but I know you
Very well now let me tell you about the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, PS Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later: Return to Sender, damn

She keeps on passing me by

Mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Oh no no, mhm

[Verse 1]
We were together just the other day
Taking life for granted, passing time away
I was there for you, you were there for me
We would be together for eternity
I never knew there'll be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever, we were so wrong
Now I just can't believe that you're gone

[Chorus]
And I'm so alone, alone
You never miss a good friend until it's gone
And I'm so alone, I'm so alone, yes I am
I really can't believe that you're gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2]
Life goes on, and it's not the same
'Cause I can't help sometimes calling out your name
(Calling out your name)
But then I realize that you won't come around, no
Oh, what I wouldn't give to see your smile
Oh, yes, we've had our ups and downs
Oh, what I wouldn't do to have you cussing me out
I know it sounds funny, but what can I say
My life just ain't the same since you went away

[Chorus]
And I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend 'til they're gone (gone)
And I'm so alone, did you have to go away
I really miss you

[Bridge]
(So alone, I'm so alone)
Oh, I'm so alone
Oh, yes I am
I'm so alone
So alone

[Pre-Chorus]
See, I never knew that there would be sorrow
But I knew we'd be together tomorrow
Together forever, we were so wrong
No, I won't believe
I just can't believe
I really don't believe

[Chorus]
I'm so alone, (alone), alone
I miss you
You never miss a good friend
(It's gonna be alright)
I'm so alone
(It's gonna be alright)
Alone, I miss you
(I know one day)
You never miss a good friend
(We'll see each other again)
I'm so alone, alone
(I miss you mama)
I miss you
(Can't nobody take your place)
You never miss a good friend
(There'll never be another like you)
I'm so alone, alone
I miss you
(You're my one and only mama)
You never miss a good friend
(And I miss you, and I miss you)

(I'm so alone)
I'm so alone, I'm
(I miss you so much)
I know you're in a better place, yes you are
(I'm so lonely without you)
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
(I miss you)
Can my friends help me sing
Here I am
See, when you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need a good friend to rely on
He's gonna be right there
(I miss you so much)
(So lonely without you)
When you're feeling down and feeling low
(I miss you)
All you gotta do is talk to Lil' Joe, oh oh
This is Jason, you know I'm your best friend
And I love you, and I love you, and I love you
(I miss you so much, so lonely without you)
(I really miss you)
See everyone's loved and lost
And nobody wants to pay that cost
But if we all stick here together
We can make everything so much better
(I miss you so much, so lonely without you)
I appreciate having a friend like all of you around
(I really miss you)"

You give what you have still that's not enough
What went wrong
'Cause now what we share are too many fears
Too many secrets and too many years
Tonight

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Deep in the night, you whisper so low
I lay by your side I felt so alone, alone
I reach for your arms, you call out a name
It wasn't my own that caused me such pain inside

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams
Is it someone else's arms that hold you tight
Or darling is it me
Tell me what you dream at night while you sleep

Tell me what you dream at night while you're sleeping
Tell me what you see at night in your dreams

Li-da-di-da-di-da-di-da

Sometimes it's so hard to see
The things that we dread so much come about so easily
And in my distress I often pray
Whoa, Jah Jah, please, when will things start to come my way

You know that better days will come
Seems like it's been so long
We seem to forget so easily
Love needs its share of energy

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

I feel so safe in saying
That in the end our love will shine
These quarrels that we're havin', my baby
Could only strengthen us in time

Come on closer to me, girl yeah, don't you see
That anything is possible as long as we believe Jah

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

Now Jah Jah will guide us
Though that goes unsaid
Rather than routin' the system
We'll seek happiness

Build our shelter in the mountains
Next to a blue crystal river
Not until then we will see
Just how bright our future will be

You know that better days will come
Seems like it's been so long
We seem to forget so easily
Love needs its share of energy

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my li-i-ight

Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light
Come on closer to me, girl
Touch my light

359,1993,Bon Jovi,Bed Of Roses,"[Verse 1]
Sitting here wasted and wounded
At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know

'Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead

With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head
While we're talking

About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

[Verse 2]
Well I'm so far away
That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone

Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses

[Bridge]
Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah

[Guitar solo]

[Verse 3]
Now as you close your eyes
Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again

Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove
For it's you that I'd die to defend

[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on...

I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses"

There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate

And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again

[Verse 2]
When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop

And I won't break and I won't bend

Hey yo, hickory dickory dock I'm under the Brooklyn block yes
Who's the next to testify and try and penetrate the vest
Diggatie do-re-me-fa-so-la-ti-do I draw back my bozac
I take it in track and give it a smack and cuttin no slack, jack
Okay here I go shorty tap the forty O smash
To a pass, if ya crash make a dash to the trash
Tap the cap, have a lot and not a lot, not a little
Don't grade upon the label take a guzzle, don't dribble
I got the supercalafragileisticexpialadou-cious
You're comin too close a to this, I get fero-cious
Coax this rhyme, smoke this rhyme hype
When we rockin upon the mic, we rock the mic right
Pass the funnel to the tunnel, I get busy till I'm dizzy
Never pass it to get fizzy cause the god gets busy, who is he?
Damn just pass it cold the cipher
When I hit the dread spot I buy a can of Red Stripe, so

Chorus (Repeat 1x)

Well I be comin' around the mountain with my ho Suzanna
I'm peelin off the caps like the hicks in Alabama
Check the grammar and the stamina I'm tootin' on my horn
Timberland boot stompin' forty drinkin born
Malt liquor chug a filter let me rip it then I kick it
Tap it once for my brothers sip it then I sip it
So xerox the zip code, I'm in the mode, perfecto
Hallelujah here I go, watch me flow and let go
Trouble shooter smoke the buddah rule like a dictator
Used to hit the fader now I play the commentator
So let me swing it from the rhyme to the concrete jungle
With the King Areis Mackin, rulin' over knuckle
Heads to the bed, cause Right Said Fred
Lock em up with the beeswax, kick it to em dread
Yo, pass the peas please party trooper, party stop
64 will give ya more if ya scammin on the block
Red top, red top, bust open krill's dope
But if you're drinkin too slow you might kiss the steel toe
Just keep the cypher movin' everything's be fine
And the forty's stops here till I finish my rhyme

Chorus (Repeat 2x)

Balance on the beam, here we go team, hype!
Pass the mic down the line, on time, drop the rhyme
I rope a rope-a-dope smokin with the red beam scopin'
Pull a magnum body back and leave a back bone broken
So was a bend a trend I'm sendin and I'm cruisin' for a hit
When I'm just sittin' in the outhouse droppin mad shhhhhhhh
Quiet on the set while the crew be gettin' wrecked
And if your stunned by the bunch I have a hunch you should step
So pass me the crazy straw and let me do the Q-Tip
What is a forty if I can't take a sip?
Sometimes I drive slow sometimes I drive fast
Sometimes I'm on E sometimes I get gas
So check the stress sure to step to the left
With an OE tap on the top, pass it back
Give a tap to the child, pass it, sorry, keep it goin
Down my throat I keep it flowin, styles keep growin'
We don't brown bag it, the label be showin'
And we don't give a damn if the hoes be knowin'
From the drip to my lip I like to pass it with a grip

I gave you all that I have inside
And you took my love

368,1993,Luther Vandross,Little Miracles (Happen Every Day),"[Verse 1]
One thing I would love to do
Is talk to someone
Wish I knew who
Sometimes the people who know the least say the most
Makes you wonder who you can trust
What's gonna happen

The first thing I know
God is love
The next thing would be
He loves me
Sometimes I'm tired of waiting for a thing or someone
Then I stop and see what He's done
And I know everything will come

[Chorus]
And it may be today
Anything can change, nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What's tomorrow for?
No one knows for sure
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen every day

[Verse 2]
And so there you go
Strangely enough
Alone even so
Addicted to love
You're in and out so quickly
That it gives you a start
You're waiting for a message or a word
But you haven't heard from your heart

[Chorus]
But it may be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
For the love in me
I really believe
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen every day

[Bridge]
What is a miracle?
Love is a miracle
Every time that you care
A miracle, it happens somewhere
So many miracles
Even small little miracles
Just take one look about
It's not hard to figure out

[Chorus]
'Cause it might be today
Anything can change
Nothing stays the same
And maybe today
What tomorrow's for
No one knows for sure
Through it all come what may
Little miracles happen everyday
Little miracles happen every day
Ooh, little miracles happen every day
They happen every day"

She knows every move that a man could make
She knows every trick in the book
She knows how to give, she knows how to take
But so many times she's been taken a fool

She knows how to make one on you

Her feelin's once came from the heart

""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

[Verse 1: Bo$$]
I don't really wanna feel
Like I'm in a daze so I smoke big kill
Just to deal with the ills like this fucked up trip (damn)
My skills ain't paying bills
And it's fucking with me and my grip (I hear you)
I drink that St. Ide's shit
And smoke a ticket at the same time
Drop a wicked bomb on my naughty nature
I'm livin' foul like a Knickerbocker (you livin' foul?)
Bitch I'm not the woman to sleep but I'm lost (yo that's deep)
Cause I be on some ole' ""I'm tired of niggas""
Trying to come up off bitches type thing (""What can I do?"")
And if I don't react the way he want he might swing
His little trick bitch ass in another direction
Then don't even use protection
I hate stupid shit assholes can avoid
Yo! And if worse came to worse I'll run a fraud on unemployed
Cause who the fuck cares that I got gray hairs and can't sleep
Know what I mean? (Yeah hell yeah, that's deep)

""This is deep, but I'm going deeper..""

Bout deep shit beyond all that bullshit
I shoot at people (yeah I know what you mean)
But fuck it I'm evil
And I'm hip to every bitch trying to get a grip
And every nigga trying to get a grip but fuck that shit
And I say fuck that shit with my mighty middle finger
I'm heavy off into this rap shit, bucking singers
Yo I think I'm getting tense (word?)
Cause my dollars ain't making no fucking sense; but then again
It's probably all that chronic that I smoked
I use to be like that when I was out there slanging dope
And lately I been flipping on some old paranoid shit
Like looking fuckers up and down trying to start shit (""What can I do?"")
Cause I'm a hard bitch (So why don't you just soften up?)
I try to be cool but I get caught up when I go to clubs, straight up
I don't even trust myself (yo, you can trust me)
Fuck I know? (I'm just like you)

Aye yo, I got them buck-wild thrills, living foul kills
I'm trying to get to Watts but I'm stuck in Baldwin Hills (damn)
Trying to find myself for real though, check it
If I just rewind myself I'll see it ain't that hectic
Y'all don't hear me talking but its time to get a stack
Cause I'm about a second away, from going back
To the corner slangin dope (now you know you don't wanna do that shit)
Gankin cluckers, jackin high, cappin marks
I may be losin' my mind but better that than my heart (I hear you)
I talk a lot of shit but I can back it all the fuck up
I'm real cool people until some bullshit get brung up
Look here, believe me I ain't comin out my crib
Tryin to snap on life and run out and do some dumb shit
So I'll be takin another sip to relax me
And get them problems out my mind that distract me
Life is workin on my last nerve (yeah I hear you G)

Every time I talk to you, when I see you
And I'm so glad that you just missed it
The way I stare to memorize your face
To kiss you in my mind
Love you all the time

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour
Please believe its true
When I tell you I love you

I've taken too many chances
Searching for the truth of love, thats in my heart
Tell me if I've made the wrong advances
Tell me if I've made you feel ashamed

Cause I know I have to do this
Would you hold my hand right through it

Cause when I close my eyes
I still can see your smile
Its bright enough to light my life
Out of my darkest hour

Had to let you just what would happen

And how you enjoy your two hour bath
And how you convinced me to dance in the rain
With everyone watching like we were insane

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

An' watch you roll your eyes when I'm slightly off-key
And I like the innocent way that you cry
At sappy old movies you've seen hundreds of times

But I love the way you love me
Strong and wild, slow and easy
Heart and soul, so completely
I love the way you love me

And I could list a million things I love to like about you

Among the fields of gold

[Verse 3]
Will you stay with me? Will you be my love?
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of gold

[Verse 4]
See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

[Bridge]
I never made promises lightly
And there have been some that I've broken
But I swear in the days still left
We'll walk in fields of gold
We'll walk in fields of gold

[Verse 5]
Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

[Verse 6]
You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold"

From now on I have a heart of stone
I'm not the girl I used to be
I'm going out into the danger zone

And I don't mind what people may say
Should I care what they think of me?
I'm looking out for a different way
I'm cuttin' loose, runnin' wild and free

Know what I want, know where to go
No one can stop me, no
Whoa, whoa

Good times with bad, bad boys
They live it up and get down easy
Good times with bad, bad boys
That's what I want, that's what I'm needin'

Don't need their love, I wanna be free
I'm not a toy that anyone can own
They take it all so seriously
I'm going out into the great unknown

You only live once, that's what they say
No one can stop me, no

The year is 1971
Now comes the first of the children of LOTUG
Lords of the Underground, witness the birth of the funky child
Doitall, hit 'em!

[Verse 1: Doitall]
Born with the fuckers from the womb of Brenda
She now likes the Lords but she used to dig the Spinners
First with the style from the birth canal
And now I got the flav to make the crowd go wild
So dig it, wahh! Ooh, watch me dig it
I'm taking no shorts unless it's coming from a midget
I tax the peace more than chicken packs grease
I'm nearly knockin' boots, but if not, I'll knock teeth
Wahh! Ga ga, ooh, cries the baby
Smacked on the ass, now the Doitall's crazy
No rattles, or playpens, or crowds when I'm rappin'
And yes, I do reruns, as if this was What's Happening
Now January 14 has birthed the funk one
The B-Day for Dupree, and yes, I'm funky
I got you bobbin' to the funky style
K-Def, let 'em know here comes the funky child

[K-Def]
Yeah... (laughs) born in the underground of Newark
Now witness the birth of Mr. Funkee

[Verse 2: Mr. Funkee]
The fifth of the terror, it's the return of Funky Kreuger
A.K. Anger, we told 'em Mr. Funkee Wallbanger
Conceived in the fire by a war through disasters
The funky child was taught to the ways of the masters
Mr. Funkee, yes, girl, the black mack is back
Here to kick my funky style, funky this and funky that
You can work day and night, you could practice all your life
But I still take the show and then I go home with the wife
Oh my God, funky with the style, Lord have mercy
I hurdle over rappers just like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Watch me flip the script, let me show you what the funk do
Make you call me uncle (What?) Uncle (What?!) Uncle (Who?!)
When I was young I used to sing with my sister
(Heyy)
Now I kick the ill styles, you have to call me mister
Cooling in the House of Hits, time to buckwild
Raised in the ways of the funky child

Back up baby, here comes the stroller
We're hit when we dry crawl and hit rock 'n' rolla
I'm caught in the swinging hypnotized by the Pendulum
Distributed by Elektra, so this is how I'm killing them
K is on the M.P., Jazz is on the Technic
Marley's on the mix, and now the Lords have a hit like POW!
Now it's time to get buckwild
And watch my funky brothers freak the underground
In a second, or minute, in no times flat...
...
Bring it back!
And go grab the album to bring the Lords money
Take it home to mom to say, ""Ain't they funky?""

[Verse 5: Mr. Funkee]
We gone psycho and everbody thought we was DAS
It didn’t affect me, I said, ""So what?"" I kept on writing rhymes
I keep my funky style perfected so no one can stop my flow
I fear no man, cause if it's on fool, then it's on
(And it's on!)
Don't worry not for other crews selling out
As long as Lords of the Underground stay underground
The brothers of LOTUG will keep the lyrical fitness
Don't worry about me selling out, mind your business
You might say, ""Damn, Mr. Funkee's going out!""
But if you listen to the words then you'll know what I'm about
Any props you receive are the props that you earn
I'm off 'til the funky child returns"
397,1993,Belly,Feed The Tree,"[Verse 1]
This old man I've talked about
Broke his own heart, poured it in the ground
Big red tree grew up and out
Throws up its leaves and spins round and round

[Chorus]
I know all this and more
So take your hat off when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree

[Verse 2]
This little squirrel I used to be
Slammed her bike down the stairs
They put silver where her teeth had been
Baby silver tooth, she grins and wins

[Chorus]
I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
Take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree

[Verse 3]
This old man I used to be
Spins around, around, around the tree
Silver baby, come to me
I'll only hurt you in my dreams

[Chorus]
I know all this and
I know all this and
I know all this and more
So take your hat off, boy, when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree
Take your hat off when you're talkin' to me
And be there when I feed the tree"

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage ah then I dip down

[Hook]
""I drop lyrics off and on like a light switch"" (x4)

[Verse 2: RZA]
Yo, Check the mic line for wire-taps
We're under attack, man your stations, take aim, proceed
Fire back, all hands on deck: cadet, vets, insert cassettes
Tracks snap heads like berets; catch web-sites like internet
Chief, I detected vehicles approaching from the East
Pass the infrared binoculars, captain, so I can see
Sound the alarm; call for the suicidal-kamikaze ninjas with the bombs
Flashes of neon, all we saw was flying arms
Anytime I come by, alumni cut short their air supply
Send 'em back like George McFly
I, be holdin' this; travel ground like a motorist
Poisonous gas released from my track, its odorless and tasteless
Like Ghost is face-less
Which allowed the God to break backs, and beat a hundred cases
MCs heads weave like trees, in a breeze to rhymes like these
Underwater flow strike like torpedoes
You get plugged more than Del Rio; played short like De Vito
Split the fuck up like Mike-Jack and Tito
Sword cuts sharper than Concorde needles
Call my second private, tell 'em write this important message to Cypress
I heard Yacub's assistant on the island was Dr. Titus
And they just released a new deadly virus
To infiltrate the Western States
It's time to pump out more rap tapes
And use the Wu-Tang symbol to communicate
RZA, over and out...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke; gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
""Hail Mary, full of grace,"" smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag and the North Face off her back
Jab her if she act, funny with the money
Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, kapeesha? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fist, like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
""Make up to break up"" Niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor and me hittin' the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rocked quick
I guess I was a combination
Of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humpin' around and jumpin' around
Jacked her, then I asked her, ""Who's the man?""
She said, ""B-I-G,"" then I'd bust in her E-Y-E

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Nas]
I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged
Then writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
Behold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme; play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep"

Johnny's daddy was takin' him fishin'
When he was eight years old
A little girl came through the front gate
Holdin' a fishin' pole
His dad looked down and smiled
Said, ""We can't leave her behind
Son, I know you don't want her to go
But someday you'll change your mind""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 1]
Take Jimmy Johnson, take Tommy Thompson
Take my best friend, Bo
Take anybody that you want as
Long as she don't go
Take any boy in the world
Daddy, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 2]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Ten years down the road
He held her tight and kissed her lips in
Front of the picture show
Stranger came and pulled a gun
Grabbed her by the arm
Said, ""If you do what I tell you to, there
Won't be any harm""

[Pre-Chorus]
And Johnny said:

[Chorus 2]
Take my money, take my wallet
Take my credit cards
Here's the watch that my grandpa gave me
Here's the key to my car
Mister, give it a whirl
But, please, don't take the girl

[Verse 3]
Same old boy, same sweet girl
Five years down the road
There's gonna be a little one and she
Says, ""It's time to go""
Doctor says, ""The baby's fine
But you'll have to leave
'Cause his momma's fadin' fast"" and
Johnny hit his knees

[Pre-Chorus]
And then he prayed:

[Chorus 3]
Take the very breath you gave me
Take the heart from my chest
I'll gladly take her place if you'll let me
Make this my last request
Take me out of this world
God, please, don't take the girl

From the battles that rage in my head

When my sanity hangs by a thread

Sometimes I just hold you
Too caught up in me to see
I'm holding a fortune
That heaven has given to me
I'll try to show you each and every way I can
Now and forever, I will be your man

Now I can rest my worries and always be sure
That I won't be alone anymore
If I'd only known you were there all the time

In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't write if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

I got a funny feeling, honey
That you're kind of digging me
But every time you see me
Word is born, you be ignoring me

I know your name, yes, I do
Because your girls told me
I know where you live, you want to bet
Because your girls showed me

But I'll parlay
And stay out of your way
Figuring I won't be ignorant
And catch you the next day

When I'm in focus, I notice you
Only move with a chosen few
Irreplaceable, what's up
With insatiable you

I never figured you
For the quiet type
On the down low
The low pro-file type

I always thought you
Was a rah-rah mama
Stirring up crazy confusion
Causing drama

What's the matter, huh
Cat got your tongue
Or some mack got you strung
Or maybe I ain't the one

Trying to figure your game
What's your angle, tell me
Where you're coming from

The whole picture is strange
So I'm digging the frame
Because I like what I see
And I want some

So tell me what's your plot
What's your plan
You're looking for
A brother to get got?
I'm not your man

But believe in me
You want to be with me
But you won't even talk to me
To tell me what it is you see in me

I gotta hear it from your girls, Uptown
The word got around from my crew
In Brooklyn and in the Boogie Down
Said you had a thing for me
And what would it take for a date
And wait, swing with me

I got your cards
You're playing hard to get
I'm long and I'm strong
And if it's on
I keep it soft and wet

Let me know cause if you don't

You got me feeling like I'm sleeping
And it's keeping me trapped

But still in all, you want to stroll
And have a fella on layaway
Fronting for nothing like it's
Something for me to stay away

Emotional trips
Get a grip
Because I'm losing it
Ideas were clear
Had it in gear
Now you're confusing it

I had the thought
That you were caught
And you were going steady
Wasn't checking for me
Cause you had a friend already

But I'mma put it all aside
Cause God is my guide
Swallow my pride, stride
And follow my guide

Let me know cause if you don't
It's going to haunt me

430,1994,Salt-N-Pepa Featuring En Vogue,Whatta Man,"[Intro]
Yeee-hey, yeah
Alright
Come on now
Yeah
Talk to me
Yeah

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yeah

[Verse 1: Salt]
I wanna take a minute or two, and give much respect due
To the man that's made a difference in my world
And although most men are ho's he flows on the down low
'Cause I never heard about him with another girl
But I don't sweat it because it's just pathetic
To let it get me involved in that he said/she said crowd
I know that ain't nobody perfect
I give props to those who deserve it
And believe me y'all, he's worth it
So here's to the future 'cause we got through the past
I finally found somebody that can make me laugh
(Ha ha ha) You so crazy
I think I wanna have your baby

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes, he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
You gotta say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Heeh

[Verse 2: Pepa]
My man is smooth like Barry, and his voice got bass
A body like Arnold with a Denzel face
He's smart like a doctor with a real good rep
And when he comes home he's relaxed with Pep
He always got a gift for me everytime I see him
A lot of snot-nosed ex-flames couldn't be him
He never ran a corny line once to me yet
So I give him stuff that he'll never forget
He keeps me on Cloud Nine just like the Temps
He's not a fake wannabe tryin' to be a pimp
He dresses like a dapper don, but even in jeans
He's a God-sent original, the man of my dreams

[Verse 3: Spinderella]
Yes, my man says he loves me, never says he loves me not
Nah don' rush me good, and touch me in the right spot
See other guys that I've had, they tried to play all that mac (shit)
But every time they tried I said, ""That's not it""
But not this man, he's got the right potion
Baby, rub it down and make it smooth like lotion
Yeah, the ritual, highway to heaven
From seven to seven he's got me open like Seven Eleven
And yes, it's me that he's always choosin'
With him I'm never losin', and he knows that my name is not Susan
He always has heavy conversation for the mind
Which means a lot to me cuz good men are hard to find

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a  mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Say it again now
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Ohh, uuuh
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
I said what a mighty good man
You know what I'm sayin', he's a mighty mighty good man
Y'all hear me, now check it out

[Verse 4: Salt]
My man gives real loving, that's why I call him Killer
He's not a wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am, he's a thriller
He takes his time and does everything right
Knocks me out with one shot for the rest of the night
He's a real smooth brother, never in a rush
And he gives me goose pimples with every single touch
Spends quality time with his kids when he can
Secure in his manhood 'cause he's a real man
A lover and a fighter and he'll knock a knucker out
Don't take him for a sucker 'cause that's not what he's about
Every time I need him, he always got my back
Never disrespectful 'cause his mama taught him that
I've got a good man

[Chorus: En Vogue]
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
A mighty mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
Yes he is
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
What a mighty good man
Whatta man, whatta man, whatta man
What a mighty good man
He's a mighty mighty good man
What a mighty mighty good man
Tell me like that sugar
Now break it down
I break it down one time
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man
Whatta man, whatta man"

So Imma gonna grab me a player suit, cuz ain't a damn thing changed
And now I'm proper and fly and shit, but man do I feel strange
So Imma go down to the liquor store, and find my friend named Gin
And go to the girl with the flyest thai, and break her off a proper twin
And now it's time to make some shit, and look for the proper mix
And run a little game on the PYT, and tell it to her somethin' like this

Just when I thought could I hit another one
So up jumps see me with the pumps and a bump
All stiggitty stiggity curves, getting on my good nerves
Looking like ice cream ready to be served
Stretch, bend it, can I get in it

Shake like a bottle girl fine as wine G

Never been a coward (cause it's a eastside thing)
Just step right up to the girl with the big butt
Tell her what's up you got the pumps and a bump

437,1994,Meat Loaf,Objects In The Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer Than...,"[Verse 1]
The skies were pure and the fields were green
And the sun was brighter than it's ever been
When I grew up with my best friend, Kenny
We were close as any brothers that you ever knew

It was always summer and the future called
We were ready for adventures and we wanted them all
And there was so much left to dream
And so much time to make it real

But I can still recall the sting of all the tears when he was gone
They say he crashed and burned, I know I'll never learn
Why any boy should die so young

We were racing, we were soldiers of fortune
We got in trouble but we sure got around
There are times I think I see him peeling out of the dark
I think he's right behind me now, and he's gaining ground

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
(They are, they are)

[Verse 2]
And when the sun descended and the night arose
I heard my father cursing everyone he knows
He was dangerous and drunk and defeated
And corroded by failure and envy and hate

There were endless winters and the dreams would freeze
Nowhere to hide and no leaves on the trees
And my father's eyes were blank
As he hit me again and again and again

I know I still believe he'd never let me leave
I had to run away alone
So many threats and fears, so many wasted years
Before my life became my own

And though the nightmares should be over
Some of the terrors are still intact
I'll hear that ugly, coarse, and violent voice
And then he grabs me from behind, and then he pulls me back

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
(They are, they are)

[Instrumental solo]

[Verse 3]
There was a beauty living on the edge of town
She always put the top up and the hammer down
And she taught me everything I'll ever know
About the mystery and the muscle of love

The stars would glimmer and the moon would glow
I'm in the back seat with my Julie like Romeo
And the signs along the highway all said
""Caution! Kids at play!""

Those were the rites of spring and we did everything
There was salvation every night
We got our dreams reborn and our upholstery torn
But everything we tried was right

She used her body just like a bandage
She used my body just like a wound
I'll probably never know where she disappeared
But I can see rising up out of the back seat now
Just like an angel rising up from a tomb

But it was long ago, and it was far away
Oh God, it seems so very far
And if life is just a highway, then the soul is just a car

[Hook]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

[Outro]
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
And objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are
Objects in the rear view mirror may appear closer than they are

She used her body just like a bandage
She used my body just like a wound
I'll never know where she disappeared
But I can see her rising up out of the back seat now"

If I never feel you in my arms again
If I never feel your tender kiss again

Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again

[Verse 1]
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way things used to be
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the love that you made to me
And I can't get you outta my head
How in the world will I begin
To let you walk right out my life
And blow my heart away?
And I can't stop carin' about
About the apple of my eye
And I can't stop doin' without
Without the center of my life
And I can't get you out of my head
And I know I can't pretend
That I won't die if you decide
You won't see me again

If I never feel you in my arms again (Again)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (Again)
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then (And then)

Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop thinkin' about
About the way my life would be
No I can't stop thinkin' about
How could you love me then leave?
And I can't get you out of my mind
God knows how hard I've tried
And if you walk right out my life
God knows I'd surely die
And I can't stop doin' without, no
(Without the rhythm of my heart)
No, I can't stop doin' without, no
(For I would surely fall apart)
And I can't get you out of my mind
('Cause I know I can't deny it)
And I would die if you decide
You won't see me again

[Chorus]
If I never feel you in my arms again (If I never ever see you)
If I never feel your tender kiss again (No, no, no, no)
If I never hear ""I love you"" now and then (Now and then)
Will I never make love to you once again? (Will I never make love, never make love?)
Please understand if love ends (Please, please understand, if it should ever end, oh no)
Then I promise you, I promise you that
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again, breathe again) (No, no, no)
That I shall never breathe again
(Breathe again)
That I shall never breathe again

That I shall never breathe

439,1994,Bonnie Raitt,Love Sneakin' Up On You,"Rainy night I'm all alone
Sitting here waiting for your voice on the phone
Fever turns to cold cold sweat
Thinking about things we ain't done yet
Tell me now
I've gotta know, do you feel the same
Do you just light up at the mention of my name

[Chorus]
Don't worry baby
Ain't nothin' new
That's just love sneakin' up on you
If your whole world is shakin'
And you feel like I do
That's just love sneakin' up on you

Nowhere on earth for your heart to hide
Once love comes sneaking up on your blind side
And you might as well try and stop the rain
Or stand in the track of a runaway train
You just can't fight it when a thing is meant to be
Come on let's finish what you started with me

Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
And the way we coming at cha

443,1994,Babyface,And Our Feelings,"[Verse 1]
We fell in love
And who could blame us
The word was we were just beside ourselves
And everybody said it wouldn't last
And now they wonder
Why we didn't last

We fell in love
It seemed so righteous
Couldn't compare our love to no one else
And everybody thought we could not win
It's no wonder
Love came to an end

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings, yeah
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know
Who don't know...

[Verse 2]
We fell apart
The bond was broken
Should've kept our thoughts between ourselves
And though they say they cared
They didn't help
Makes me wonder
Should we blame ourselves?

So here we are
Broken hearted
What in the world have we done to ourselves?
When everybody says to let it end, baby
Well, it makes me wonder
We can't let them win

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

[Bridge]
If we'd only just try, we could make it by
And maybe in time we could make it right
If we only had done what we shoulda done
We'd both be here still making love
I wanna know that, that we can go back
Back to the times when the lovin' was all that
When no one could come between our love

[Chorus]
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know

And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words that come from whispers
From people we don't know
And our feelings
Just aren't feelings anymore
They're just words without emotion
From people who don't know"

Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

445,1994,Gin Blossoms,Found Out About You,"All last summer in case you don't recall
I was yours and you were mine forget it all
Is there a line that I could write
That's sad enough to make you cry?
And all the lines you wrote to me were lies

Months roll past, the love that you struck dead
Did you love me only in my head?
There were things you said and did to me
They seem to come so easily
The love I thought I'd won you give for free

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Rumors follow everywhere you go
Like when you left and I was last to know
Well you're famous now and there's no doubt
In all the places you hang out
They know your name and they know what you're about

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Street lights blink on through the car window
I get the time too often on AM radio
Well you know it's all I think about
I write your name, drive past your house
Your boyfriend's over, I watch your lights go out

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

Whispers at the bus stop
Well I've heard about nights out in the school yard
I found out about you
I found out about you

I found about you"
446,1994,Arrested Development,Ease My Mind,"I need some time to ease my mind

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
From my mamas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
It's that bond that keeps the movement movin' on
Life is surrounded with so many insecurities
Back stabbin' is like breathing when in poverty
I try to make my sanity, with the insane
God is secondary to most, when they scrap for money
But, then again money can cause even more death
When a African becomes a nigga step n fetch n all
I dare say when price is right U can buy us all
Well not me, cuz I don't truly give a care about you
I'll move in poverty, in wealth but I'll surely move!
Ain't syncopated with your beats or your wack grooves
My break beat is to break away from yo thang
All these things you put on me makes this brother sing...

Chorus:
I need some time to ease my mind

Mind & soul is even more important then body
Money can put my body in all exotic spaces
Meanwhile my mind & soul remotely dwells
Within that fine spot between all messed up & hell
And so I move on with confidence of harmony
And do my thang to resist this wack society
Cuz if you don't resist, & I mean consciously
You'll fool your sub-conscious into accepting it
I ain't acceptin' it - I keep my focus
I keep my focus - I ain't acceptin'it
Give me a face pencil to draw a smile on me
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly body inner peace
Answer my prayer to give my Earthly
Body
Inner
Inner peace
Until that day upon which my souls released!

Chorus

Need some time need some time
When the sista's say it then you know it's gotta be real!

Thrusted in a world that I don't know
From my mommas lips between my mamas hips
I'm cuddled by her hands because she understands
It's that bond that will keep the movement movin' on
It's that bond that will keep the movement movin' on
And so I GOTTA BE READY TO RELINQUISH
Gotta be ready to relinquish, my breath of life for struggle

That is why I tell you...

I need some time to ease my mind"
447,1994,Huey Lewis & The News,(She's) Some Kind Of Wonderful,"I don't need whole lots 'a money
I don't need a big, fine car
I got everything that a man could want
I got more than I could ask for

See, I don't have to run around
I don't have to stay out all night
'Cause I got a sweet, a sweet lovin' woman
And she knows just how to treat me right

My baby, she's all right
My baby, clean out of sight, don't you know that
She's

She's some kind 'a wonderful Yes she is
She's some kind 'a wonderful
Now let me tell you one thing

When she holds me in her arms
She sets my soul on fire
Ooh, when my baby kisses me
It fills my heart with desire
And when she wraps her lovin' arms around me
Always tires me out of my mind
I feel a funny little feeling inside of me
Chills run up and down my spine

My baby, she's all right
My baby, clean out of sight, don't you know that
She's

She's some kind 'a wonderful, Yes she is
She's some kind 'a wonderful

Now is there anybody
Got a sweet little woman like mine
Got to be somebody
With a sweet little woman like mine

Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness
Can I get a witness"
448,1994,Phil Collins,Everyday,"[Verse 1]
I got lost, couldn't find my way
And I guess there's nothing more to say
Love can make you blind, make you act so strange
But I'm here and here I'll stay
So everyday I cry
Yes everyday I fall
Do you ever wonder why, why I love everything about you

[Chorus]
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Verse 2]
It picked me up, knocked me off my feet
I've got no way to explain
Still i love you, love you, love you but this fire inside
Will never see the light of day
So everyday goes by
And everyday i fall
It makes me wonder why
My life's worth nothing without you

[Chorus]
But everyday i say i'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Bridge]
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know just how close we were
You'll never know, no, no, no, no, no
You'll never know
No you'll never see

[Verse 3]
The book closes and we try to forget
But i know that things won't change
How we feel, how life goes on
And that seems so strange
And so the light fades away
Try, try, try as i may
I can't stop thinking about you
It seems my life's worth nothing without you

[Chorus]
But everyday I say I'll try to make my heart be still
Until then every way there is to cry, ourselves to sleep we will

[Outro]
Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard
Everyday, everyday it gets a little harder

Everyday, everyday you know i try so hard"
449,1994,FRENTE!,Bizarre Love Triangle,"Every time I think of you
I get a shot right through into a bolt of blue
It's no problem with mind but it's a problem I find
Living a life that I can't leave behind

There's no sense in telling me
The wisdom of a fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes and it's what nobody knows
And every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I feel like I never should
Whenever I get this way, I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday?

I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself, that if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for the final moment
You say the words that I can't say"

Ain't nothin' goin' on but the bomb-ass rap song
Hittin' all night long
Just like me on the black and white ivory
Gettin' six on artillery (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
You don't want to see a G
Break yo' ass like dishes
Buster-ass tricks, sleep with the fishes
Runnin' from Lennox, up at Venice
They wanna have me in stripes (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Like Dennis the Menace
But that ain't poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo'-hoppin', ass droppin', Coupe DeVille
My troupe can, ill—fool, (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh) I got skills
So, back on up 'fore I check that chin
Down as fuck and I'm full off Henn'
You gets no love and I thought you knew it

Kam and Solo, they got nuts
When Ice Cube write a sentence
I want The Bomb (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)

That's how I poke hot lead in yo' ass
With ""Mo' Bounce to the Ounce"" in the dash
Mash up, Van Ness, headed for the West
Everything is great (Woh-uh-oh-oh-oh)
Slow down for the dip
On 100 and 8th and keep mashin'

Boy, take your time because we have all night
I'm gonna show you what I've been thinking of

I got love on my mind
I know I should wait but tonight feels right
I think it's about that time

And I'm in the mood to be moved
And do all the things you want me to, boy

(Ugh) Ha-ha-ha, I'm serious, nigga
One of y'all niggas got some bad motherfuckin' breath
(Oh, man) Aye, baby, aye, baby, (shit) aye, baby
Get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or somethin'
Aye, nigga, get somethin' to eat, dog
Aye, nigga, study long, study wrong, nigga

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kind of hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky-ass shit, like, every single day
May I kick a little something for the G's
And make a few ends as I breeze through?
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
‘Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the livin' room gettin' it on
And they ain't leavin' till six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But (but what?) we don't love them hoes, yeah
So we gon' smoke an ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & Lil David Ruffin, Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but, fool, I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie (Sadie?)
She used to be the homeboy's lady (Oh, that bitch)
80 degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, ‘cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound
Feel the breeze beyotch, I'm just…

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg & Daz Dillinger]
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' indo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Later on that day, my homie Dr. Dre
Came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke; shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me; not with a cherry on top
‘Cause when I bust my nut I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset, girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you, hoes, I'm out the door, and I'll be...

459,1994,Aretha Franklin,Willing To Forgive,"[Verse 1]
I read her letters
And I saw her picture
And I smelled her cheap perfume
It must have come from you
How could you touch her?
Lay down beside her?
Well, there just ain't no excuse
You shouldn't have been so loose

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw the telephone bill
You must be out of your mind
If you think you can smooth it over
Then you're wasting your time

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Verse 2]
You're such a liar
You took her and her children
Out for the afternoon
While I was sittin' waitin' on you
How could you do it?
You should've been here with me
You just couldn't do it
You had to be in the streets

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I heard through the grapevine
You've been messin' around
When you thought you were gettin' over
That's when a baby girl found out

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(You really hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess (Guess I) I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
(Oh, baby, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, you really hurt me this time, baby)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit (Although I must admit)
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time
(I'm gonna mess around some time)

[Bridge]
I gave my heart, gave my time
Gave my soul 'cause love was blind
I can't explain this poor excuse
Of a man, of a boy who was born to lose
I paid the rent, I washed your clothes
Cooked your food and only God knows
Only God knows why I stay with you
I guess I...I'm in love

[Chorus]
Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget
'Cause you really, really, really, really hurt me this time
(Ooh, oh, baby, you hurt me, you hurt me)
And I guess I can go on although I must admit
I've been busy, busy, busy, busy thinking that I'm gonna mess around some time

Well, I'm willing to forgive you but I can't forget

Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

[Verse 1]
I remember (back in the days)
When I just a little niggarole
I looked up to my bigger bro
Begged if I could kick it so
When he went out with girls I could go tagging along
Nagging if she had a sis maybe could mack a baby hoodrat
Y'all remember way back then, when it was 1985
All the way live, I think I was about ten
One of those happy little niggas singing the blues
That be always trying to bag with the shag and karate shoes
Sayin ""Yo momma black; his momma this, his momma that""
Then he get mad and wanna scrap
We stay mad about, ten minutes then it's like back on the bike
To play hide and go get it with the younger hoes by the bungalows
Then switch to playing ding dong ditch, when that gets
Old and too cold to hack it, threw on a bomber jacket
You could tell the ballers cuz they bell wearing Gazelles
And if they really had money raised be sporting BK's
And, all the girls had they turkish link
If it broke then they made earrings to it, like they meant to do it
But, sometimes, I still sit and reminisce
Then, think about the years I was raised, back in the days

[Hook]
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore

But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again

What? (back in the day) When? (back in the day)

[Verse 2]
I'm still back in the days, but now the year is '87
'88 that's when my crew and I were in junior high
In 7th grade, I hated school (wish it'd blown up)
No doubt I couldn't wait to get out (and be a grownup)
But let me finish this reminiscing and telling
'Bout when girls was belling tight corduroys like for the boys
Basket weaves, Nike Cortez, and footsie socks
And eating pickles, with tootsie pops
And it don't stop, I'm glad cause when J.J. Fad hit Supersonic
It was kinda like a sport to wear biker shorts
Or to wear jeans and it seemed like the masses
Of hoochies had Poison airbrushed on they asses
Dudes had on Nike suits, and the Pumas with
The fat laces cause it was either that or K-Swiss
I miss those days and so I pout like a grown jerk
Wishing all I had to do now, was finish homework
It's true, you don't realize really what you got til it's gone
And I'm not, gonna sing another sad song, but
Sometimes I do sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

[Verse 3]
Well, it's the niggarole, I figure that now I'm all grown up
Because I'm eighteen years old, and guess you could say I'm holding
Down a steady job and crew steady mobbing
You steady bobbing your head and I'm paid, so I got it made
But, didn't always have clout, used to live in South Central L.A
That's where I stayed and figured a way out
I gave it all I had so for what it's worth
I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first
So Ahmad and The Jones' is on our way up
Yup, we said that we was gonna make it since a kid
And we finally did, but
Sometimes I still sit and reminisce then
Think about the years I was raised, back in the days

Don't ya say shit just get inside
It's time to take your ass on another kind of trip
Cuz you can't have the hop if you don't have the hip
Grab you gat with the extra clip
And close your eyes and hit the switch
We're going to a place where everybody kick it, kick it, kick it
Yea that's the ticket
Ain't no bloodin, ain't no crippin
Ain't no punk ass niggas set trippin'
Everybody got a stack and it ain't no crack
And it really don't matter if you're white or black

Put something in the tank, and I know that I can bring ya
If ya can't take the heat get ya ass out the kitchen
We on a mission

I'm tryin to find a place where I can live my life and
Maybe eat some steak with my beans and rice
A place where my kids can play outside without livin in fear of a drive by
And even if I get away from them drive by killaz
I still gotta worry about those snitch ass niggas
I keep on searchin' and I keep on lookin'
But niggas are the same from Watts to Brooklyn
I try to keep my faith in my people
But sometimes my people be actin' like they evil
You don't understand about runnin' with a gang
Cause you don't gang bang
And you don't have to stand on the corner and slang
Cause you got your own thang
You can't help me if you can't help yourself
You better make a left

Life is a bitch and then you die
Still trying to get a piece of that apple pie
Every game ain't the same cause the game still remain
Don't it seem kinda strange ain't a damn thing changed
If you don't work then you don't eat
And only down ass niggas can ride with me
Hip hop hop your 45 quickly down the block
Stay sucker free and keep the busters of your jock
You gotta have heart son if you wanna go
Watch this sweet chariot, swing low
Ain't nobody crying ain't nobody dyin'
Ain't nobody worryin' everybody's tryin'
Nothing from nothin' leaves nothin'
If you wanna have somethin' you better stop frontin'
What you gonna do when the 5 rolls by?

On a gaudy neon street
Not that I care at all
I spent the best part of my losing streak
In an Army Jeep

And I check the odds
And I place my bet
I pour a drink
And I pull the blind
And I wonder what I'll find

Lights so bright
Palm sweat, blackjack
On a Saturday night

Leaving for good, for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good

[Verse 2]
Used to be I could drive up to
Barstow for the night
Find some crossroad trucker
To demonstrate his might
But these days it seems that
Nowhere is far enough away
So I'm leaving Las Vegas today

[Chorus]
I'm leaving Las Vegas oh
Lights so bright
Blackjack
On a Saturday night
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
For good

[Verse 3]
I'm standing in the middle of the desert
Waiting for my ship to come in
But now no joker, no jack, no king
Can take this loser hand
And make it win

[Chorus]
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving Las Vegas
For good
For good

[Verse 4]
I quit my job as a dancer
At the Lido Des Girls
Dealing blackjack until one or two
Such a muddy line between
The things you want
And the things you have to do

[Chorus]
I'm leaving Las Vegas (oh, oh, oh)
Lights so bright
Palm sweat
Blackjack
On a Saturday night
Leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
Oh, I'm Leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
Palm sweat
Blackjack
On a Saturday night
I'm leaving Las Vegas
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving for good
I'm leaving Las Vegas
Lights so bright
On a Saturday night

He cups his hands and he lights a cigarette
I find myself in the bones of his face

It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in

He's got his hands in my hair
And his lips everywhere
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins

He's got me up against the back of a pick-up truck
Out of sight of the neon and glare
We might as well be on a beach under the moonlight
Love's language reads the same anywhere, yeah

It's just the night in my veins
Oh, making me crawl in the dust again
It's just the night under my skin
Slipping it in

He's got his chest on my back
Across a new Cadillac
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right
Even if it's just the night in my veins
Even if it's just the night in my veins, oh

I've got my head on the curb
And I can't produce a word
Oh yeah, it feels good, it's all right

Half unconscious from the pain

Laughs and says, I find ways
Just when we're sheltered under paper
The rockets come at us sideways

The life from in your eyes
And I remain alone, no matter who
May try and take your place

The tears I should have seen
We used to say forever
But I'll remember you

Your shadows painted dark
I will always love you
I'll remember you

Summer rain to fallen snow
We knew that it would last
But there's no way to know
It's such a storm that's in the sky
Quietly will pass, quietly we'll cry
And here I stand, alone with every
Promise melted through my hands

Oh, and I remain, alone no matter
Who may try and take your place

That is what you would want
Good advise, they are right
That's what I need to do
But what I want, all I want is you

What I need is bread and water
And a father for our daughter
What I need is someone new
What I want is you

Buck's pulling out on cops cause I want free Glocks
What the fuck, bring your bitch-ass type brigade
Hitting them all, hand guns and hand grenades
I resemble the man that's wanted for murder
Got your block locked down, so don't come any further
In my clip is a .22 dum-dum

Word to Herb, lick shot with my verb

(Hey)
(It's all good)
Y'all ready for this?
(Uh huh, it's all good)

Now this ain't the name calling game
See, I can refrain from using names to get fame
Since I'm known to create the kinds of beats that make your rump shake
Records are great, but now let's set the record straight

(They thought you was a sellout)
I'm sellin' out tours 'cause sellin' CDs, I'm the one MB
You wanna beat the G, I beat you like hizzos
In the backseat of my Caddy you'll be callin' me Hammer Daddy

I'll work you like a slave
Misbehavin' you were gonna
Pay tax on one of my brothers' souls
Hit the street, caught up in your deuce
And I refuse to forget that alright you talked tough
But face to face was a just a trick, bro

They put me in the mix, too legit to quit
I came wit' a long list of it
And in the future you'll find me on the billboard
Or on the floor of the sign receiving music awards
And it's all good

The talk you been talkin'
To talk that talk
You gotta walk that walk
Oh, the Hammer man's talkin'
So enter the dragon
And once you burned up
Those that caught in the dis-Hammer bandwagon

Suckers, read Billboard and weep
You're in a hot seat, where I'm from, talk is cheap
And when I see ya, the styles you wrote man
A mean left hook took ya out, and it came from Oakland

Check it, you punks don't know me
A true OG, yo, I was runnin' the whole scene
You started talking that mess but I'm callin' your bluff trick
I thought you knew and boy you still can't touch this

It's better than the average bro
I'm not the average Joe with the average flow
Yo, I can still do things that you wish you could
You're talkin' all that lip, but I don't even trip

I'm fed up, so now I gotta set 'em up
Knock 'em to the ground and never ever let 'em up
But like a trick he might kick I'll be prepared to red 'em up
However, if you wanna slang 'em, then we can get 'em up

Black sheep, you're weak, you're meek, you're tryin' to grow feet
Dres I make ya look head but first, I'mma get your teeth
Talkin' about my mama's where I draw the line Redman
Dancin' with the corners of yo dome I'mma blow your mind, so!

Since I'm not the run of the mill
I feel the need to say you wanna be, you gotta be real
'Cause if ya ever come my way like I used to say
Homeboy you better pray just to make it today

I know what it is
The ratta tat piece of corny rhymes you keep sayin' we don't find worth playin'
I don't feel like I'm a gangsta so you claim that I'm a sellout
When we meet up on the street, then we'll see who bail out
And it's all good

499,1994,The Sounds Of Blackness,I Believe,"[Verse 1: Twisted Insane]
Blood on the floor boards probably from the murder that went down right before I moved in
Blow it off and I ain't really trippin' had my share of victims, so I'm feeling six foot ten
Been up in this bitch a couple weeks and I can feel it when I'm walkin' in the hallway then I noticed something different
Everywhere I go I got the heat now, why the fuck I gotta act like this when I'm up in my own kitchen
Open up the fridge to get a glass of water and I see a shadow get to movin' out the corner of my eye and I'm
Trippin' and I'm really wiggin' out because the only thing up in my hand's a fuckin' glass of water and some iodine
Why am I actin' like this dumb shit cause I'm home alone and ain't nobody in the fuckin' house with me
The light in the basement, the water in the bath how the fuck I hear the noise up on the third story balcony?
Tryna get some sleep? Nigga! I be in for thirty minutes, then I'm getting woke up by the moans
It's always soundin' like somebody talkin' on the phone little kids always laughing and they humming out a song
Summoned a demon by the devil, I don't know what I'm dealing with and maybe I should really get to pushing
Hoppin' up in the whip and never get back before they attack I would'a been faster but I never had no pillow for my cushion
You tell me that you don't believe in ghosts? Hmm, well I don't know what I am looking at because it's looking back
And I don't wanna make no sudden moves to get your noodle cracked the only thing I wanna do is walk up in the room and pack
Enough of this, I been out for the dough, I gotta go and I ain't signed up for the motherfucking ghost on my porch or
I don't want no more or for another second, lookin' at 'em harbourin' the blood stains on my floor board

[Hook x2]
Murder kill, murder yeah
Murder murder kill, murder yeah
There is blood on my floor boards
So much blood on my floor boards

[Verse 2: Kamikazi]
Mind control I'm controlled lost in a realm where time is slow
Life is so, when I'm off in my own hell I can go where the lights are low (cypher souls)
Deep in the underground I found love with the knife I hold
But when I awoke, what I was told
Will you commit a murder? Well I suppose..
That's when it happens take a blood bath then a match to the mattress
I'm strapped in hear the sounds of the blackness
Smell the rigor mortis from an ill practice
Have you ever had the urge to kill?
Hit em with a power surge burn 'til he has to squeal
Ask i will.. Go against everything I believe even if it means mask and will
That's for real..
Make you wonder why me? Sever veins let me summon my peace
I'm inhaling my weed I'm concealing my deeds and I'm really feelin Brainsick will center my chi
Breathe life into me like right when the beast might strike in the night what a sight that would be knife twice in em
Ain't no Minnesota nice in 'em neither my venom like 9 millimeters wit the sights in em
I'm playing tug'o war for now and you  would never know the pain of an orphan child
Morbid smiles in the rain when its pouring out and we the motherfuckin' problem they should warn about.. You hear me?
Flash images fast past in intervals black plague the ritual cynical individual
Black bag the minimum that face you givin' 'em castrate the victim of when the mission is critical
Ain't no love for those wicked as us sick enough for bone flesh and guts MK ultra folklore
Influenced from another dimension unlike some I just wanna be done don't give me no more
Angelic demonic spirits and cold wars summon every demon from here to Vatican warlords
Either that or familiar patterns in full force
See the brain matter when blood splatters the floor boards
Aaaah!"
500,1995,Bryan Adams,Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman?,"[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Bridge]
Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

You know you really love a woman

(Background chatter)
This is how we do it!
(This is how we do it!)
Sha la la la la la lo
Shabada lo lo lo, whoa
(This is how we do it!)
Lo lo lo low-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
This is how we do it
It's Friday night, and I feel alright
The party is here on the West Side
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver, take the keys to my truck
Hit the 'shaw cause I'm faded
Honies in the street say, ""Monty, yo, we made it!""
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors, you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (this is how we do it)

[Verse 2]
This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wannabe player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lower-case g
But now I'm a big G
The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say...

[Chorus]
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Y?N-Vee, SCC (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

[Verse 3]
Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6' 8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and Oji are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we're makin' tha dash

[Chorus]
Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)

Straight up comin' from the West Side (This is how we do it)

C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)

Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by
Turn around
Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart

Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll never be the boy you always you wanted to be
Turn around
Every now and then I know you'll always be the only boy who wanted me the way that I am
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's no one in the universe as magical and wonderous as you
Turn around
Every now and then I know there's nothing any better; there's nothing that I just wouldn't do
Turn around bright eyes
Every now and then I fall apart

And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you'll only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong together
We can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time
I don't know what to do and I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Once upon a time I was falling in love
But now I'm only falling apart
There's nothing I can do
A total eclipse of the heart
Once upon a time there was light in my life
But now there's only love in the dark
Nothing I can say
A total eclipse of the heart

But now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark
Now there's only love in the dark

We don't even talk anymore

We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Now, now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well, maybe that's a pain we can't hide
Cause everybody knows that we're both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other?
Why do we push love away?

[Chorus]
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let's don't wait till the water runs dry
We'll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don't do it, baby

Money is our incentive now so that makes it okay

She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind

[Verse 2]
She never lets me in
Only tell me where's she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

[Verse 3]
This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Saying...

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

Let her be, oh

[Bridge]
Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling, ""Oh mama, please help me""
Won't you hold my hand and...

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be

Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor

Sending all opposition to see a mortician

Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with

517,1995,Blues Traveler,Run-Around,"Oh, once upon a midnight dearie
I woke with something in my head
I couldn't escape the memory
Of a phone call and of what you said

Like a game show contestant with a parting gift
I could not believe my eyes
When I saw through the voice of a trusted friend
Who needs to humor me and tell me lies
Yeah, humor me and tell me lies

And I'll lie too and say I don't mind
And as we seek, so shall we find
And when you're feeling open, I'll still be here
But not without a certain degree of fear
Of what will be with you and me
I still can see things hopefully

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

And shake me and my confidence
'Bout a great many things
But I've been there, I can see it cower
Like a nervous magician waiting in the wings

Of a bad play where the heroes are right
And nobody thinks or expects too much
And Hollywood's calling for the movie rights
Singing, ""Hey babe, let's keep in touch
Hey baby, let's keep in touch""

But I want more than a touch, I want you to reach me
And show me all the things no one else can see
So what you feel becomes mine as well
And soon if we're lucky, we'd be unable to tell
What's yours and mine, the fishing's fine
And it doesn't have to rhyme, so don't you feed me a line

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Ha la la la, bombardier, this is the pilot speaking
And I got some news for you
It seems my ship still stands no matter what you drop
And there ain't a whole lot that you can do

Oh sure, the banner may be torn and the wind's gotten colder
Perhaps I've grown a little cynical
But I know no matter what the waitress brings
I shall drink in and always be full
Yeah, I will drink in and always be full

Oh, I like coffee and I like tea
Like to be able to enter a final plea
I still got this dream that you just can't shake
I love you to the point you can no longer take
Well, all right, okay, so be that way
I hope and pray that there's something left to say

But you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?

Oh, you
Why you wanna give me a run-around?
Is it a sure-fire way to speed things up
When all it does is slow me down?"

Wash my body clean

Along a crooked path
Where the walls have fallen
And broken me in half

I will not rest till I lay down my head
I'm gonna go
In the house of stone and light
I shall not cry for the blind man I leave behind
When I got
In the house of stone and light

Show me my soul
Tell me of that place
Where I must surely go
Old man waiting
At the gates for me
Give me the wisdom
Give me the key

Take a bow, the night is over
This masquerade is getting older
Lights are low, the curtains down
There's no one here
(There's no one here, there's no one in the crowd)

Say your lines, but do you feel them?
Do you mean what you say when there's no one around?
(No one around)
Watching you, watching me, one lonely star
(One lonely star, you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Verse 2: Madonna, Babyface]
Make them laugh, it comes so easy
When you get to the part where you're breaking my heart
(Breaking my heart)
Hide behind your smile, all the world loves a clown
(Just make them smile the whole world loves a clown)

Wish you well, I cannot stay
You deserve an award for the role that you played
(Role that you played)
No more masquerade, you're one lonely star
(One lonely star and you don't know who you are)

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)

I've always been in love with you (Always with you)
I guess you've always known it's true (You know it's true)
You took my love for granted, why, oh, why?
The show is over, say good-bye
Say good-bye (Bye-bye)
Say good-bye

[Bridge: Madonna, Babyface]
All the world is a stage (World is a stage)
And everyone has their part (Has their part)
But how was I to know which way the story’d go?
How was I to know you'd break (You'd break, you'd break, you'd break)
You'd break my heart?

[Chorus: Madonna, Babyface, Both]
I've always been in love with you

I should have seen it coming when roses died
Should have seen the end of summer in your eyes
I should have listened when you said good night
You really meant good bye

You're really on your knees, when you think you're standing tall
But only fools are ""know-it-alls"" and i played that fool for you

There were nights that I died for you baby

Baby, i thought you and me would stand the test of time
Like we got away with the perfect crime
But we were just a legend in my mind
I guess that I was blind
Remember those nights dancing at the masquerade
The clowns wore smiles that wouldn't fade
But you and I were the renegades, some things never change
It made me so mad because I wanted it bad for us baby
And now it's so sad that whatever we had ain't worth saving

If the love that I've got for you is gone
And if the river I’ve cried ain’t that long
Then I'm wrong, yeah I'm wrong, this ain't a love song

Is the reason I'm holding on

538,1995,TLC,Waterfalls,"[Verse 1: T-Boz]
A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time, he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep hisself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

[Chorus: TLC]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast

[Verse 3: Left Eye]
Come on!
I seen a rainbow yesterday, but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray, I pray
All ten fade away, seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true, only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system's got you victim to your own mind
Dreams are hopeless aspirations in hopes of coming true
Believe in yourself, the rest is up to me and you

[Chorus: TLC (Chilli)]
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast

Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

Don't go chasing waterfalls (Don't go, don't go)
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to

And I told her Brooklyn
Atmosphere filled with romance

555,1995,IV Xample,I'd Rather Be Alone,"Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
You want me to forgive you
You said please understand
Girl, you made me a fool
I thought that I was your only man
You don't know how it hurts me
To learn that I was wrong
Though I gave you my heart
You were just playing me all along
Too late to work it out
'Cause I know my minds filled with to much doubt
To ever try it again
I guess deep down I know you'll have to go
But it's just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
(I'd rather be alone)
There was no need to use me
There was no need to lie
When I think of the times
We were together girl, I just cried
It's crazy but I still love you
After all things you've done
You don't know what you mean to me
Baby, I thought that you were the one
We can't work it out
'Cause I know that my hearts filled with too much doubt
To ever try it again
I guess deep down, I know you'll have to go
But it's just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone
I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone
Girl, we can't work it out
'Cause I know my minds filled with to much doubt
To ever try it again, baby
'Cause deep down I know you'll have to go, it's not fair
Just isn't fair 'cause I still care
Although I love you girl, I'd rather be alone

I know it's wrong, I can't go on
Although I'll miss you girl, I'd rather be alone

You don't know how you move me
Deconstruct me
And consume me
I'm all used up
I'm out of luck
I am starstuck
By something in your eyes
That is keeping my hope alive

[Chorus]
But I'm sick of myself when I look at you
Something is beautiful and true
In a world that's ugly and a lie
It's hard to even want to try
And I'm beginning to think
Baby you don't know

I'll take or leave
The room to breathe
The choice to leave you
I'll throw away
A chance at greatness
Just to make this
Dream come into play
I don't know if I'll find a way

'Cause I'm sick of myself when i look at you
Something is beautiful and true
In a world that's ugly and a lie

That you ain't feelin' too fine
And I hope that you feel much better
Yes, I do

You looked into my eyes
You said to me that night
That you would never cheat on me
Or break my heart
Inside I never knew
Your love was so untrue
I thought that I was your only
Boy, was I wrong, so wrong

We lose, we face the pain

Oh, boy, you had my faith, you had my trust, you had my love
But now I have to take it back, it didn't work for us
And all I really needed was your lovin'

Now here's a Dear John letter that I've written just for you
And all I really needed was your lovin'

560,1995,Naughty By Nature,Feel Me Flow,"[Verse 1: Treach]
You 'bout to feel the chronicles of a bionical lyric
Lyrically splittin', dismissin'
I'm on a mission of just hittin'
Now it's written and kitten hittin' with mittens
I'm missin', wishin', man, listen
I glisten like sun and water while fishin'
Bust the move and then swerve
Serve words with nerve embedded, I said it, word
Damn, you nerd, man, you heard
Comin' from the town of Illy and alleys
Are full of Phillies and Rallys
Suckers get silly as Sally
Then found in alleys, I'm rowdy really
So here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me... flow
Never mixin' with trickin' brothers bitchin'
Over vixens that ain't fittin' to be hittin'
For nothin', splittin' things that's bitten and gettin' written off
You're like a fatter half bladder, boy, you pissin' me off
Before you even started, so what, so long, see you fly by, my try
How else could I say it when you play it, try boom-bye-bye
Bye-bye!

[Hook]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 2: Treach]
The flow pro poetical with skills only a vet'll know
Better know where's the wetter flow that's on point like decimals
Manhandlin' new crews
Partyin' with the Zoo Crew
Lookin' for the pink in boo boo's, I thought you knew too
Stone style's of stamina
Jammin' to while we plannin' to jam
We bust, plus we're the party amateur damagers
Managin', damagin' mics, men and even mannequins
You're a fan again
Now I wanna know, who's the man again?
Naughty's back like vertebraes
Word to hey-a-ho, the way I show, you pray I flow
Steady breakin' to the boogie so bang time
To slang, bang and watch all the poo-tang tangs hang

[Hook: Treach]
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow
Here we go
Now holla if ya hear me though
Come and feel me flow

[Verse 3: Treach]
Play and Kay'll break the body of a beat
Then beat the break into boogie
Firm and fully, chase bass-lines like bullies
All we wanna know is if your body wanna party
It's 'nuff poo-tang tang for everybody
So hip up and split up
Get up, get up your with up
Souped up, put your dukes up, no guts set up for sit-ups
Flip up, watch us rip up
Shake shows until they fizz up
Rizz up like you're with us
If not, zip up your lip up
Whip up hits with ransoms, foul styles get and ones
We came back 'cause we heard hip-hop needed another anthem
Black like Noah, in fact and fo' ya
If we was back in the days with the Drifters
We would've been known as the Flow-ers
Repin' these since the '70s, find me
So we went crazy in the '80s
So we won't kiss heinies in the '90s
Oops, the Naughty's, troops in sections with forties
So clap your hands and hold your shorty, I'm Naughty

Here we go

I was young (BOP)
And didn't have no where to run
I needed to wake up (Wake up) and see (And see)
What's in front of me (na-na-op)
There had to be a better way
Sing it again a better way
To show I'm grateful (hum)
So I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know much you mean to me

[Chorus: All]
'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

All through my life
I knew that you'd be my world
Knowing everywhere I go
Things you taught me they would show
So many times and changes
You've seen me through
I sho nuff couldn't have survived without you, you
And so I thought up this song
To show my appreciation for lovin' me so long
You don't know how much you mean to me, oh

'Cause even though when times got rough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)
When I felt I had enough
You never turned away
You were right there
And I thank you (thank you)

Riding on any wave
That is the luck you crave
They don't believe it now
They just think it's stupid
So got anything?
Anyone could have done
Who would've cared at all
Not you

[Chorus]
Another heart has made the trade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how a heart is a spade
But somehow the vital connection is made

[Verse 2]
Riding on anything
Anything's good enough
Who would've thought it of
Someone like you
Just as they brought me round
Now that they brought you down
Roundabout and roundabout
Who wants a life anyway?

[Chorus]
Another heart has made the grade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how the last card is played
But somehow the vital connection is made"

Is slowly, is slowly drivin' me insane, boy

When I was young and the world belonged to me
I thought that love meant pain and jealousy
It was a cross on my shoulder
Oh Lord, now I feel so much older, ooh, ooh
Time had a way of making me see
My lonely life has taken it's toll on me
Now I feel the emptiness
And I don't want to live like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I've heard stories, I've heard songs
Telling me believe my heart don't wait too long
But words they don't ring true
Until there was you

Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
Until the end of time

[Verse 2]
How do I trust what I'm beginning to feel?
How deep my soul, how much can I reveal?
I'm lost in love's mystery
Caught between time and eternity
Now there's a door that opens wide
Slowly I will find my way and reach inside
But I couldn't make it through
Until there was you

[Chorus]
Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
And only when I see the light of love shine
Until the end of time

[Verse 3]
Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
Only when I know that you'll be mine
And only when I see the light of love shine
Never will I lose this heart's desire
Ever will I feed our love's fire
And when I see the light of love shine
In your eyes when they meet mine
Only then I'll know it's you and I
Until the end of time"

I've been waiting for this moment secretly
Counting every minute
Every hour till you're with me
'Cause I know just what's in store
And now I'm in your arms, baby close the door

Why waste another minute
Ooh, let's get right to it
Baby turn the lights down

Unspoken pleasure

How you make me feel
When you're near me and whisper softly
So don't stop

And it seems time flies
Whenever I'm in your arms
I like to savor every second
You thrill me with your charm

Now I'm lost in the passion
(Moment, feelings, magic) we share
And when I look into your eyes
I know how much you care

Don't wanna rush the feeling
'Cause loving you's so real and
I like the way you set the mood
With a little wine and candlelight

It's more than emotion
Let's keep this fire going
Now we're lost inside our love
(Now we're drifting into love)
Sweet surrender is so tender

Ooh, you know me oh so well
You always take your time
And you always get it right

Ooh, you set my soul on fire
And I know you've got my rhythm

[Verse 1]
In some secluded rendezvous
That overlooks the avenue
He stepped into the streets and walked up to this girl
He had a cap tooth made of gold
He had an earing in his nose
And dreadlocks that at  night he liked to twirl
And he says:
""I love the way you look at me, I love your smile
Why don't you come and talk to me just for a while?
Give me your love, oohhh give me your love
Why don't you come and talk to me, give me your love?

And now the hours go by fast
And memories come from the past
As he tells the girl the story of his life
You see a long long time ago
He fell in love, but let her go
And if he had the chance again, she'd be his wife
And he sings to her nightly, he says
""Lydia, oh Lydia, I wish I didn't get ridda ya
Lydia I miss your rose tatoo
There's some things I can't forget
Oh hunny why did I dis ya? (you can learn alot from Lydia)
I gotta move it like this""

Aaahhhhhhh
Aaahhhhhhh (hold me, squeeze me)

[Verse 3]
Now take a cup and walk away
To this secret hideaway
And our lonely man is at a loss for words
She says ""How far do you want to go?""
He says ""How far is to-morrow?""
And when they make love, this is all that can be heard
Silence, and then you hear
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Aye aye aye aye aye, give me ecstacy
Aye aye aye aye aye, make sweet love to me
Give me all those things i miss
But start is off with a kiss

Lady: One moment please, he's around
4-Tay: Yo, wassup?
Fly: Wassup, Fo? I know you finished that cut for the radio
4-Tay: As a matter of fact Fly I just finished it baby boy, no worry about nothin', I'll be around

[4-Tay]
Regardless if I'm chillin' backstage or on tour
With my homie Young Fly even Al B. Sure
Never hesitate to call me after I'm done
'Cause homie I'm real and always true to my loved ones
Too many wakes and funerals full of tears
You say there's something on your mind, well hey, I'm all ears
'Cause ain't nobody thinking about the funk that you're choosin' it
A lot of my homies stuck in the pen for life or losin' it
Call up your folks you keep thinkin' about home
Recorder keeps a peep and there's a block on the phone
And all of this is enough to make a brother's nerves bad
Reminds me of a situation that I once had
Spent that, spent this endless relentless tremendous women on my jock
And don't nobody mind their business
He say she say throwin' salt about
And chooses to talk about you cause there's nothin' else to talk about
Talk about the show and the flow and all the clout
Then be real with yourself and talk about and turned it out
It's not hard to compete when one who's name is poppin'
A scared man can never win that's why I stay clockin'
Sticky like a cactus and I practice with tight stuff
And trippin' on these suckers 'cause I know they ain't tight enough
Put 'em on a platter like a stage and they get scared
Waitin' for an intro from the Fo and I'm well prepared
Fools be huffin' and puffin' don't wanna see me about nothin' I'm down
And if you ever need me Fly: I'll be around

[Hook]
Whenever you call me: I'll be there
Whenever you want me: I'll be there
Whenever you need me: I'll be there
I'll be around

Life ain't based on peaches and cream
This new generation holds a whole lot of dreams
Future doctors, producers, and mothers
The list goes on but now we killin' our brothers
And if we killin' our brothers that means we killin' our own kind
These kids are watchin' now it goes to their mind
Rat-tat-a-tat cause you got a gat
Then they want a gat you livin' like that?
But I'm not surprised just look what's televised
It shouldn't take a bullet for a brother to realize
We runnin' the hard heads, they runnin' the hot lead
Then visit a death bed, I feel that's enough said
Enough is enough, too much crime buildin'
No I'm not a role model but I'm thinkin' of children
That hang out late night 'cause they feel that's right
To watch the gunplay or bloody streetfight
So I'm a be around with a funky rap, G
I know how it is and hopefully you feel me
'Cause where I come from we rap to tight beats
And if you don't hustle that's a day you don't eat
Moms ain't cookin' she worked the week straight
If anything she's the one deserves a hot plate
The ghetto, the ghetto ain't nothin' to dream about
Tryin' to get out now that's somethin' to think about
Fools might disagree but I'm a stay sucka free
And I'm so black and so strong they can't fade me
Blacks are blacks worst enemy there's still no remedy
You got me for a grip still you call yourself kin of me?
Jealousy, envy, I see it in your eyes
Tell me what's wrong with seeing a black man rise
I keep it funky it's pretty hard to miss it now and is it not explicit
A message for the mind, and a moral for statistics
So I'm doin' what we call a roll call
Callin' out the ones who won't rap to take a downfall
I spit the street life and then I go underground
You silly, it's called versatility and I'll be around

[Hook]

Things are gettin' crucial you gotta exercise your mind
Or learn about life before you're left behind
But how you gonna get it right when you're not doin' right
When you get mad all you want is a gunfight
'Cause you ain't havin' that but understand that
You pretty hard to talk to holding a gat
So here's a new concept for your agenda
You'll live to be old if you control your temper
This tension causes a gang of madness
Now you want funk that results to sadness
Sadness results to a lot of revenge
And your so called friends really ain't your friends
So how do you know who you're able to trust
If you think about the past look what happened to us
I never trust no one, I only trust myself
Or I would've been a victim like everyone else
In friendship or hardship whenever you need me
Just give me a call G I won't deceive thee
These fools be shakin' best believe they're fakin'
Just tryin' to get a grip of all the money you're makin'
This ain't race a mind is a terrible thing to waste
I drop the rap and J drops the bass
To the flow cause ain't nobody get with Fo
I'm a down young brother comin' straight outta Frisco
Droppin' a message out of love to your town
Love your brothers and sisters and I'll be around

[Hook]"
569,1995,U.N.V.,So In Love With You,"You are to me
What poetry tries to say with a word
You are a song
All the music my heart ever heard

I can't escape
The air that I breathe even speaks of you
And I'm not ashamed to say
That I feel this way

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love (So in love), with, with you (Ooh, hoo...)

Words can't express
What I confess with each beat of my heart
I'm overwhelmed
With a passionate affair from the start, oh...

Our love will grow
As the years come and go, I will be by your side, oh, yes, I will
There isn't anything
That I would deny

I will stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true
I reveal here and now
As we both take this vow
I am so in love, I am so in love with you

I promise to honor and cherish you
For better or for worse
I'll be there for you
For richer or for poorer
In sickness and in health
Till death do us part
(And I will)
From this day on and forever

I will (I will) stand before God
Give you all that I've got
I can promise you I'll be true (I will promise you)

Don't make me lose my mind

Baby, I can't take no more
Of you trying to play me out, baby

But I was wrong and now I must move on

571,1995,Jill Sobule,I Kissed A Girl,"Jenny came over and told me about Brad
He's such a hairy behemoth she said
And dumb as a box of hammers
But he's such a handsome guy
And I opened up and I told her about Larry
And yesterday how he asked me to marry
I'm not giving him an answer yet
I think I can do better

So we laughed, compared notes
We had a drink, we had a smoke
She took off her overcoat
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl

So she called home to say she'd be late
He said, he worried but now he'd feel safe
I'm glad you're with your girlfriend
Tell her ""Hi"" for me
Then I looked at you, you had guilt in your eyes
But it only lasted a little while
And then I felt your hand above my knee

And we laughed at the world
They can have their diamonds
And we'll have our pearls
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl

I kissed a girl, her lips were sweet
She was just like kissing me
I kissed a girl, won't change the world
But I'm so glad
I kissed a girl

And we laughed at the world
They can have their diamonds
And we'll have our pearls
I kissed a girl (for the first time)
I kissed a girl (and I may do it again)
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl

I kissed a girl, her lips were sweet
She was just like kissing me (but better)
I kissed a girl

I kissed a girl, won't change the world
But I'm so glad
I kissed a girl (for the first time)
I kissed a girl (won't be the last time)
I kissed a girl
I kissed a girl"

I saw you dancing
Say Yaki-Da my love
I'm waiting for a chance
To get to know you
To ask for a dance
Just look into my eyes
And I'll take you to paradise
REFRAIN
I'm falling, I'm falling
'Cause life's not easy for me
Please touch me like you do
To have you near me
To go where you go
Why waste a lot of time
My love is not a serious crime
REFRAIN
I'm falling to pieces
Who do you think you are
Maybe I've gone too far
Maybe I'm in love with you
Don't hurt me or treat me bad
'Cause I will fight for what is mine
Say Yaki-Da
'Cause life is meant for living"

Can't forget the day

And made me love once more, ooh ooh hoo

And decided to stay

It's good to be king, if just for a while
To be there in velvet, yeah, to give 'em a smile
It's good to get high and never come down
It's good to be king of your own little town

Yeah, the world would swing, oh, if I were king
Can I help it if I still dream time to time?

[Verse 2]
It's good to be king and have your own way
Get a feeling of peace at the end of the day
And when your bulldog barks and your canary sings
You're out there with winners, it's good to be king

Yeah, I'll be king when dogs get wings
Can I help it if I still dream time to time?

[Verse 3]
It's good to be king and have your own world
It helps to make friends, it's good to meet girls
A sweet little queen who can't run away
It's good to be king, whatever it pays

Excuse me if I have some place in my mind
Where I go time to time"

578,1995,Skee-Lo,I Wish,"[Intro]
Hey, this is radio station WSKEE
We're taking calls on the wish line
Making your wacky wishes come true
Hello?

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 1]
I wish I was like six-foot-nine so I can get with Leoshi
'Cause she don't know me but, yo, she's really fine
You know I see her all the time, everywhere I go
And even in my dreams, I can scheme of ways to make her mine
'Cause I know she's livin' phat
Her boyfriend's tall and he plays ball, so how am I gonna compete with that?
'Cause when it comes to playing basketball
I'm always last to be picked and in some cases never picked at all
So I just lean up on the wall
Or sit up in the bleachers with the rest of the girls who came to watch their man ball
Dag y'all! I never understood, black
Why the jocks get the fly girls, and me, I get the hood rats
I tell 'em, ""Scat, skittle, scabobble""
Got hit with a bottle and put in a hospital for talkin' that mess
I confess, it's a shame
When you livin' in a city that's the size of a box and nobody knows yo' name
Glad I came, to my senses
Like quick-quick, got sick-sick to my stomach
Overcometh by thoughts of me and her together, right?
So when I asked her out, she said I wasn't her type

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

[Verse 2]
I wish I had a brand new car so far, I got this hatchback
And everywhere I go, yo, I gets laughed at
And when I'm in my car I'm laid back
I got an 8-track, and a spare tire in the backseat, but that's flat
And do you really wanna know what's really wack?
See, I can't even get a date, so what do you think of that?
I heard that prom night is a bomb night
With a hood rat t'you can hold tight
But really though, I'm Figaro
When in my car, I can't even get a hello
Well, so many people wanna cruise Crenshaw on Sunday
One day I'mma have to get in my car and go
You know I take the 110 until the 105
Get off at Crenshaw, tell my homies, ""Look alive""
'Cause it's hard to survive
When you're living in a concrete jungle and these girls keep passing me by
She looks fly, she looks fly
Make me say, ""my, my, my""

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala

I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller, y'all
I wish I was a baller
I wish I was a little bit taller
I wish I was a baller

[Verse 3]
Hey, I wish I had my way
'Cause every day would be a Friday, and you could even speed on the highway
I would play ghetto games
Name my kids ghetto names: Little Mookie, Big Al, Lorraine
Yo, you know that's on the real
So if you're down on your luck then you should know just how I feel
'Cause if you don't want me around
See, I go simple, I go easy, I go Greyhound
Hey, you, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down
Ah, yes, ain't that fresh?
Everybody wants to get down like that

[Chorus]
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat
And a six four Impala
I wish I was a little bit taller, I wish I was a baller
I wish I had a girl who looked good, I would call her
I wish I had a rabbit in a hat with a bat

582,1995,Naughty By Nature,Craziest,"[Intro]
Today people we will be exploring the mind
Back in 1995 lots of treasures of lost scrolls were left here
We will be walking through many corridors that no one has ever seen
Or has ever returned from

Why are you so hostile?
What’s behind this anger?
Why are you so rebellious?
What are you thinking?

[Verse 1: Treach]
My thoughts are thundering, tumbling
Sons of bitches, switches, from yelling to mumbling
You ain't a pal of me, my family ties but not with Mallory
My analogy ain't for salary as I roll reality through galaxies
Four centuries, it's sent to me with the scent of weed
With a chain representing penitentiaries
From warring towns to Bordentown
From Newark to Illtown
And all you know from
Lifers, Rikers to Folsom
Wasn't driving too fast, I was flying too low
You think I'm rocking too quick, I think you're listening too slow
I'm abrupting construction a pumping assumption
You diss while your family say I'm the best shit since fucking
Struckin behind an obstruction or turning something of nothing from
Poor shit to more shit as I rip in every function
Funking it up, pumping it up, chumping the ducks
Looking to hump Ms. Junk in the Trunk, pump pump me up

[Chorus]
Jersey niggas are the craziest
New York niggas are the craziest
DC niggas are the craziest
Philly niggas are the craziest
LA niggas are the craziest
Chi town niggas are the craziest
Texas niggas are the craziest
Utah niggas are the craziest

[Verse 2: Vin Rock]
My lyrics be laced with 40 ounces of funk and stuff
You get rushed, you get bust, you call yourself callin' my bluff Enough's enough, I'm puttin' it down on the real end
This one goes out to all the people who be questioning my skills
Niggas I been rockin' since Lee twills
And we feel that we build careers of steel
So all the rest come up and test but only stress is what you'll find thinking
Vinnie don't write and Vinnie can't rhyme Shrinkin
The sleepin' MC I eat like Good 'n' Plenty
Lyrically spankin' ya that's why they call me Uncle Vinnie
And oh yes, I just appeal to the masses
Young to old folks, the upper, lower, middle classes
They don't begin wit no lying professor
They begin when Vin pick up the pen and pad up off the dresser
Lest a man should ever challenge the clan
With thirteen years experience of rippin' mics put in our hands

[Chorus]
Detroit niggas are the craziest
Miami niggas are the craziest
Little Rock niggas are the craziest
Oak Town niggas are the craziest

Verse 3: Treach
I got barbarians to bogard me in
At a club that barred me when
A broad got thrown like barbarnigan born again, thrown aboard
A brim is broke to the back I brawl and band from brains ta balls
Da boots word ta-burr-bam-boo break the loot
Blowing up brain cells BOOM like Beirut
Assume the same suit, fuck that fly shit wit the flavor ca shi
Gives last name ain't Suzuki but still my sidekick
Whip that hide quick if ya slide quick, blood clot ya Blood clique
You ain't rolling if our tape ain't what ya ride wit
Niggas snipe shit so I'm on a knife tip
Like the Youngsters 'bout ta take you on some hip-hop ride shit
If you ain't jumpin then don't pump it
I'm hittin Jermaine in Atlanta cos he owe me loot for that jump shit
Fuck astronauts I rock it
And from now on if you bite my style when I see you, I'm in your pockets

I'd rather be here with you baby, forever
My heart belongs to you 'cause I think about you all the time
I know my love is true when we're together

I've played around girl and I made you cry
When I looked up, you were saying goodbye
I'm begging you please, I need you so bad
Don't leave me now, you're the best that I've had

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

All I have is just my heart and my feelings, I give to you
That's all that I can do, give you forever, oh oh oh
You don't know that you're hurting me 'cause it's not just a sexual thang
I want to share my dreams, baby together

Girl, I'm afraid just to give you the love
My heart's still in need to hold back on my love
But when you get close, I just want you to know
I start to get weak I can't let you go

I've never, I'll never find someone like you, I promise it's true
No I'll never, I'll never find someone like you
Girl I love the way that you are, girl I won't, no I won't let you go
No one could ever do the way I would make love to you

Just your smile, tenderness

586,1995,Max-A-Million,Fat Boy,"[Verse]
I’ve been going thru a lot
Still I’m handy, no cap
Because even when I’m sad
My productions at a max
I’m getting cash
You a mother fucking tax
I’m in my bag
Yours’ smelling like trash, yeah

I’m tryna get with some women
Of course I’m asking first
She just tryna talk about life
I’m down, we matchin’ first?
Rocket into space and backstroke along the comets
Yeah this girl got a celestial body, but she from planet earth

I’m in my notes, writing songs and she heard it
Now I got her singing and her pitch fuckin’ perfect
See I’m no, Max Scherzer, but I’m, not in the rafters
You get curved like batters, I guess I’m a catcher

Pros would draft ‘em, but exposures a bitch
Wishing’ for riches when I’m lonely, ’til I’m lonely and rich
An impossible niche that I’m pillow talking to Kim
’Til she stop the convo short and ask me, what’s the sitch

Like, whatcha mean? Whatcha want, a fuckin’ label?
Perspective interchangeable, imma let it sit
She just want the boy, I just want the Benjamins
President callin’, but I send him to messages

I’m the Don how I’m mobbin’, got heads bobbin like pendulums, my
Producer on the toms, I catch a beat like Edelman, they
Say that they’re better than Dom, but scores will settle it
In a fight for the life, styled after the Revenant

But she can come along, if she’s got morals
’Til my style blooms and shirts looking floral
’Til the day we smoking reef, in the whip colored coral
She talks about death, then ghosts in, paranormal

Got me feelin’ immortal, and her ex wanna quarrel
She 18, and this ain’t the Cold War, it’s winter formal
My allies got him dancing, now he’s seeing star shapes
We don’t pack guns, little bitch, we let the arms race

Showed that part to grand pop, he say thats hot
He’s thankful I’m his heir, not the rabbit or a bad mop
But while we’re talking hair, I might as well compare my shit bangs like I’m Demi Lovato, way back in Camp Rock

Playboy bunnies coming quicker than a slapshot
Hockey sippin’ women, so my brothers get no backwash
Though you so preppy, I’m biased when saying “chad, stop”
My ego big, my dough nuts: I’m a fat cop

Yeah, and now the college girls wanna
Bring me solace, cuz they study
Quantum physics, so they think they know my
Problems, give me brain and I’ll be better by
Mañana screaming Hakuna Ma-fuckin’-tata

I’ve been going thru a lot
Still I’m handy, no cap
(I really have, though)
Even when I’m sad
My productions at a max
A million in cash, you a mufuckin’ tax
I’m in my bag, yours’ smellin’ like trash

Kinda sorta like you got your team inside a jansport
Sure, I got a baddie with her feet up on the dashboard
(Can you put your feet down, please?)
She ain’t the greatest, I’ll know that I made it
The day sex changes, I’m not talking ‘bout the trans form

Yeah, I gotcha mad like a pissed parent, who
Had to keep the fucking child in a split marriage
Now they gotta bring the fuckin’ child while they run errands, whose
Running round and acting up, it’s gotcha so embarrassed

I got bars, little bitch, that’s for damn sure
But if she’s taking xans, it’s a no, if she cams, worse
But if she wanna treat me right
Then I’m baby no pampers

Honeys yelling bout me like they’re on the Maury Povich
I’m not a father but monitor sounds, got me awoken
Still lonely how I coast
Smoking stogies, thinking bout the wide open while doors
Closing"
587,1995,Masta Ace Incorporated,The I.N.C. Ride,"[Intro: Leschea]
Two times for your mind. Masta Ace Incorporated, hitting with the B bass for your dome. I go by the name of Leschea. Rocking mad vocals for the INC. And this is how we do it from the B side

[Verse One: Masta Ace]
Ain't nothing but the head rush funk to make your car jump
Who go the bump when the tapes start to pump?
It's the Incorporated, crew from eastbound
It's that funky ass B bass sound so gather round
Cause this is how we do it from the Brooklyn side
Fix your weave, leave your guns in the ride
And come on in, come on in, come on in, come on in
And do bring a friend

[Paula Perry]
You get broke like English when you step to the P
I'm letting niggas know when they trying to jack me
Cause I come from the Fort where a nine can be bought
As easy as a nickle bag of weed and a quart
Mother punks
With no inch heel tells me
Pushing them ends to impress but they don't feel me
Your gear is busted and your kicks is bum
So I'm tempted to believe that you're rolling with none
Bet you don't got more than five in your pocket
Fronting like somebody want your broke ass, you need to stop it
Head for the hills
Cause you're now and when you see real nigs you get the chills

[Hook: Paula Perry]
This is how we do it from the Brooklyn side
(Rolling, with the boom in the ride)
This is how we do it from the Brooklyn side
(Cruising, with the boom in the ride)
This is how we do it from the Brooklyn side
(Lounging, with the boom in the ride)
This is how we do it from the Brooklyn side
Right, right, right, right, right
Ain't nothing like the B bass
Ain't nothing like the Brooklyn bass
Ain't nothing like the B bass
Ain't nothing like the Brooklyn bass

[Verse Two: Lord Digga]
Any MC that want to come flex skills
I can make 'em disappear like David Copperfield
I'm in the mood
For fucking niggas up
It's the Crazy Drunken Style I got rum in my cup
So bust a flow
Joe Montana
Black like a gorilla
Pass the banana
One day, I plan to have more gifts than Santa
So bitches can Hawk me like I play for Atlanta
Skip to my what?
I'm not a fucking dancer
Six foot one
Black like a Panther
And when it comes to mic's getting ripped
I bust raps like 9's, 3/8th of 4/5ths
To the dome
Minds get blown
I'm not the one to fuck with so leave me alone
And come on in, come on in, come on in, come on in
And do bring a friend

[Masta Ace]
I got the Funk like Doobie, you be, illing
What you gonna be doing for that Rolex? Killing
Tracks with the axe as I chop to the top
Follow me and
You know I just don't stop
You can fool some of the people some of the time
But nobody got a flow that's dumber than mine
So keep on keeping on in that direction
No protection when you come in my section
The B bass is what we call it
I'm bum rushing
Flushing punks down the toilet
So jump in your cruise and put it into fifth gear
As we explode in ya ear
Yeah

Kelly took a lifetime
Searching for the bottom line
I wasn't into searching
'Cause I was doing fine
I wasn't into fighting, chasing
Sweating, slaving, fretting, racing
Any waste of effort
Isn't part of my design
Billy was an inspiration
Positive and kind
Until he let confusion
Overcome his youthful mind
Common sense dictated
I could never be so blind

Then I see you

Coincidence, the second chance
Re-sounding like a rhyme
How paths may cross against the odds
To wreck the plans you made
Among the crowd a face that smiles
To melt your masquerade
If only I could see you
Says the stranger deep inside
And lets you know that when you were
So sure you really lied
If only I could see you
Says the voice within your brain
And quietly, insistently
It says it once again

If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

[Verse 2]
She'll let you in her car
To go driving around
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That will bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

[Bridge]
You've gone a million miles
How far would you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

[Verse 3]
She'll lead you down a path
There will be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"
595,1995,Sophie B. Hawkins,As I Lay Me Down,"[Verse 1]
It felt like springtime
On this February morning
In a courtyard
Birds were singing your praise
I'm still recalling things you said
To make me feel all right
I carry them with me today now

[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

[Verse 2]
I wonder why
I feel so high
Though I am not above the sorrow
Heavy-hearted
'Til you call my name
And it sounds like church bells
Or the whistle of a train
On a summer evening
I want to meet you barefoot
Barely breathing

[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
Oh, darling
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

[Bridge]
It`s not too near for me
Like a flower
I need the rain
Thought it`s not clear to me
Every season has its change
And I will see you
When the sun comes out again

[Chorus]
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy
As I lay me down to sleep
This I pray
That you will hold me, dear
Though I'm far away
I`ll whisper your name
Into the sky
And I will wake up happy

Mmm, the sun comes out again
When the sun comes out again

Shit
Word, I'll bust that nigga ass right now
Ain't no– none of them niggas can't fuck with me
What? Nigga, you could never fuck with me, my nigga
I'll fuck you up right now, what? What? What?
Bust your motherfucking ass, boy
I ain't no motherfucking joke, you know who you talking to? (Yo, word up, bust that nigga ass, word up)
Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'll fuck you up right now
Yeah, what? What? What?
He ain't sayin' nothin', fuck him

[Verse]
I'm the one-man army, Ason
I never been tooken out, I keep MC's looking out
I drop science like Cosby dropping babies
Enough to make a nigga go crazy
In the G-Building, taking all types of medicines
Your ass thought you were better than
Ason? I keep planets in orbit
While I be coming with deeper and more shit
Enough to make you break and shake your ass
As I create rhyme good as a Tastykake makes
This style, I'm mastered in
Niggas catching headaches, what? What? You need aspirin?
This type of pain, you couldn't even kill with Midol
Fuck around, get sprayed with Lysol
In your face like a can of mace, baby
Is it burning? Well, fuck it, now you're learning
How I don't even like your motherfucking profile
Give me my fucking shit, chk-chk, blaow
Last seen and heard, no one knows
You forget, niggas be quiet as kept
Now you know nothing
Before you knew a whole fucking lot
Your ass don't wanna get shot
A lot of MC's came to my showdown
And watched me put your fucking ass low down
As you can go, below zero
Without a doubt, I never been tooken out
By a nigga who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga who couldn't figure
Yo, by a nigga who couldn't figure (Brooklyn Zoo)
How to pull a fucking gun trigger, I said ""Get the fuck outta here""
Nigga wanna get too close to the utmost
But I got stacks that'll jack any wack host
Introducing, yo, fuck that nigga's name
My hip-hop drops on your head like rain
And when it rains it pours, 'cause my rhymes hardcore
That's why I give you more of the raw
Talent that I got will rizzock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Woah-ho-ho, let me, like, slow up with the flow
If I move too quick, oh, you just won't know
I'm homicidal when you enter the target
Nigga, get up, act like a pig, try to hog shit
So I'll take your ass out quick
The mics, I'm had it, my nigga, you can suck my dick
If you wanna step to my motherfucking rep
Chk-chk, blaow, blaow, blaow, blown to death
You got shot 'cause you knock-knock-knock
""Who's there?"" Another motherfucking hard rock
Slacking on your macking 'cause raw's what you lack
You wanna react? Bring it on back (Back)

Shame on you when you step through to

Dig the way this go down (I like it)

[Verse 1]
I hit a flow all dipped in 'Lo
Sit back and sip Moe as I count my dough
Grand Puba Maxwell, Doogie, comin' with the New York
We keep it real like jail when we mic talk
Honeys know 'cause when I'm in the set
Grand Puba is the one who makes they stink box wet
So let me tell ya somethin' lady
When ya flow this flow then it's all cream and baby
I made this one for the (brothers in the party)
To find a hottie and dance body to body
Step one, first you grab honey by the waist
Step two, then you move at a ghetto pace
Step three, then ya look her dead in the face
Step four, now it's time to leave this place
Hold up, be careful of the cheesa's, the teasa's
The one who wants the money and the Visa's
I'ma tell honeys straight off the bat
But please don't even go there with that, dig it
This one's designed to make your spine in your back wind
Grand Puba lights it up for you every time

Ooh, yeah I like it

Could it be I've stayed away too long
Thief MC's be wishin' I was gone
Because they wanna be where I are
But ya can't get that far, so stop wishing on a star
It's only one Grand P
So honey do what you did on the night you creeped with me
It's no doubt I come real with that, the butter track
The one that makes the honeys hit the bed mat
I'm energetic, poetic, athletic, with good credit
So just move like I'm Simon and I said it
Ya see, my flow is just a step ahead
I'm still wicked in a bed because I'm down right nasty like newlyweds
So back up and let me breathe
Cause when it comes to gettin' down, I'm gettin' looser than a crackhead's hair weave
And I, betcha by golly wow
Ya never find another style like this if ya search a million miles
So why'n cha let Puba nice your party
I hit a flow like Al Jarreau
See, I've been doin' this for years
I'm leavin' MC's in tears, tears, dig it
Cause they fallin' just like the rain
Grand Puba's too much for the brain
Now gold diggers who try to get it
I left 'em backwards, they thought they farted when they shitted
Cause Puba's everything, and everything is Pu
Cause I hit 'em with the (one), and then with the (two)
Yeah, cause that's just how Grand Pu and Stud Doogie do
Ya didn't know I was the bomb, baby?
Somebody should've told you, somebody should have told you

Maybe she'd be here right now
But instead...

I pretended I'm glad you went away
These four walls closin' more every day
And I'm dying inside
And nobody knows it but me
Like a clown I put on a show
The pain is real even if nobody knows
And I'm crying inside
And nobody knows it but me

Why didn't I say
The things I needed to say
How could I let my angel get away
Now my world is just a tumblin' down
I can say it so clearly
But you're nowhere around

And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you

I carry a smile when I'm broken in two
And I'm nobody without someone like you
I'm tremblin' inside

I'm screamin' at night as if I thought you'd hear me
Yeah my heart is callin' you
And nobody knows it but me

How blue can I get
You could ask my heart
But like a jigsaw puzzle it's been torn all apart
A million words couldn't say just how I feel
A million years from now you know
I'll be lovin' you still

The nights are lonely, the days are so sad
And I just keep thinkin' about
The love that we had
And I'm missin' you

Tomorrow mornin' I'm hitting the dusty road
Gonna find you wherever, ever you might go
I'm gonna unload my heart
And hope you come back to me

But if feels like just yesterday when I found out my mom just passed away

So much i still have to say but I passed up my only shot

Should of showed you I loved you but I was too busy smoking pot

To busy starting fights and arguments and breaking rules
Hanging out with the wrong group of people cause I thought it made me cool

Now I know I was a fool sorry being such a jerk
And now your dead and I can't take any of it back and now it makes it so much worse

I just wanna be able to wake up in the morning and pretend it doesn't hurt

On the day you died I wondered why the hell you had to go to work

Cause if you didn't you'd still be alive I'd be able to sleep at night

Why the hell would god take me from this planet and leave me behind

You love me, bents?, Monica ,Stacey and my damn brother

It bothers me knowing  my children are never gonna meet there grandmother

I just wanna cry actually I wanna die cause the day you passed away I bottled up all Inside

Couple days ago was Mother's Day but you weren't here to celebrate

They say the day you die you always make it to a better place

That may be true but without you i don't know how I'll make it through

You always said you loved me but I never said the same to you

Chorus:

Circles & Cycles and seasons
For everything there's always reason
But it's never good
Never turns out as it should

And now I lay awake in remember? what you did for me

If god is really how is any of this crap ment to be

I loved you so much and now I'll never be able to tell you that

Just to see your face again I'll go to frickn hell and back
But I know your never coming back

I wish I had my mother back
Your the only reason that I'm breathing your only reason why I wanna rap

Everybody wanna try and be able to hold me back and keep me on the ground

They say god real but I keep looking and he's not around
Ain't no body gonna be able to save me I can't save my fricken self

Need some major help cause I don't wanna burn inside the flames of hell

Everything you do in life has gotta be for something right think I need to go to bed and deal with the pain another night

I don't even wanna right but I gotta be able to go with the pain

Someone to save hell with a broke heart but I have a broken brain

I just wanna walk away but I've got a lot to say but I feel like I'm better off dead or put in jail locked away

What up everybody, so glad you're here
It's Coolio wit' the flow back in your ear
This ain't a fantastic voyage, but I'm still on a mission
To see if I can get your attention
Now I wanst to drop some information
Just a little additive to your education
I live my life by the code of the funk
600 watt amps, 18's in the trunk
When I'm on the street, you gotta feel my beat, so
Throw your hands up if you're down with the C
Double O, L, I, O with the flow
I'm lookin' for the party, so let a nigga know
1 2 3, it's like A B C
If hip hop didn't pay, I'd rap for free
Slide, slide, but that's that past

Baby you can do it, take your time do it right

Comin' at 'em with pattern an' a fresh pair of atoms
I hope you don't trip cuz I don't want to have to gat 'em
So move your body baby, drive the homeys crazy
The way you shake that ass, always amaze me
Ain't no party like a west coast party
Cuz a west coast party don't stop
So when you see a young nigga
In a Chevy hittin' switches, then you gotta give the nigga his props

Everything so much

I will love you for the earth at my feet
I will love you for the sun in the sky
I will love you for the falling rain
I will love you for the heart that could break
I will love you for the dreams that we share
I will love you for the falling rain

Facing the wind
Tears from my eyes
Baby, where have you been
When I was hoping
Was waiting for you
To pull back the door
To take me by the hand
And lead me through

This whole world was
A stranger to me
Now you have opened
My heart to everything

Now you've disappeared somewhere
Like outer space
You've found some better place

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Could you be dead?
You always were two steps ahead
Of everyone
We'd walk behind while you would run
I look up at your house
And I can almost hear you shout
Down to me
Where I always used to be

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain
And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

Back on the train
I ask why did I come again
Can I confess
I've been hanging around your old address?
And the years have proved
To offer nothing since you moved
You're long gone
But I can't move on

And I miss you
Like the deserts miss the rain

And if the sun don't shine, you brighten up my day
And if the sun don't shine, you brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall, it never seems to fall my way
And if the rain should fall, it never falls my way
And when it's cold outside, you're there to keep me warm
And if it's cold outside, you're there to keep me warm
Those days I'm feeling weak, you make me feel so strong
And if i'm feeling weak, you make me feel so strong

And if the sun don't shine, you brighten up my day
And if the sun don't shine, you brighten up my day
And if the rain should fall, it never seems to fall my way
And if the rain should fall, it never falls my way
And when it's cold outside, you're there to keep me warm

Take this pink ribbon off my eyes
I'm exposed, and it's no big surprise
Don't you think I know exactly where I stand?
This world is forcing me to hold your hand

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, oh, little old me
Well, don't let me out of your sight
Oh, I'm just a girl, all pretty and petite
So don't let me have any rights

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here

[Verse 2]
The moment that I step outside
So many reasons for me to run and hide
I can't do the little things I hold so dear
'Cause it's all those little things that I fear

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm just a girl, I'd rather not be
'Cause they won't let me drive late at night
Oh, I'm just a girl, guess I'm some kind of freak
'Cause they all sit and stare with their eyes
Oh, I'm just a girl, take a good look at me
Just your typical prototype

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I've had it up to here
Oh, am I making myself clear?

[Bridge]
I'm just a girl
I'm just a girl in the world
That's all that you'll let me be

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm just a girl, living in captivity
Your rule of thumb makes me worrisome
Oh, I'm just a girl, what's my destiny?
What I've succumbed to is making me numb
Oh, I'm just a girl, my apologies
What I've become is so burdensome
Oh, I'm just a girl, lucky me
Twiddle-dum, there's no comparison

Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to
Oh, I've had it up to here"
633,1996,Natalie Merchant,Wonder,"[Verse 1]
Doctors have come from distant cities
Just to see me
Stand over my bed
Disbelieving what they're seeing
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of God's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation
Newspapers ask intimate questions
Want confessions
They reach into my head
To steal the glory of my story
They say I must be one of the wonders
Of god's own creation
And as far as they can see they can offer
No explanation

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe
Fate smiled and destiny
Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience and with faith
She'll make her way
She'll make her way

[Verse 2]
People see me
I'm a challenge to your balance
I'm over your heads
How I confound you and astound you
To know I must be one of the wonders
Of God's own creation
And as far as you can see you can offer me
No explanation

[Chorus]
Oh, I believe
Fate smiled and destiny
Laughed as she came to my cradle
Know this child will be able
Laughed as she came to my mother
Know this child will not suffer
Laughed as my body she lifted
Know this child will be gifted
With love, with patience and with faith
She'll make her way
She'll make her way

Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet
Junebug skippin' like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end
To it all

[Chorus]
And I don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

[Verse 2]
Double-cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in store
Morphine city slippin' dues
Down to see

[Chorus 2]
That we don't even care
As restless as we are
We feel the pull
In the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement

[Bridge]
Lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below
Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

[Verse 3]
Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it
To see

[Chorus 1]
That we don't even care
To shake these zipper blues
And we don't know
Just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess
Forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Rain, rain on my face
It hasn't stopped raining for days
My world is a flood
Slowly I become one with the mud

[Chorus]
But if I can't swim after forty days
And my mind is crushed by the thrashing waves
Lift me up so high that I cannot fall
Lift me up
Lift me up - when I'm falling
Lift me up - I'm weak and I'm dying
Lift me up - I need you to hold me
Lift me up - Keep me from drowning again

Downpour on my soul
Splashing in the ocean, I'm losing control
Dark sky all around
I can't feel my feet touching the ground

Calm the storms that drench my eyes
Dry the streams still flowing
Cast down all the waves of sin
And guilt that overthrow me

Lift me up - I need you to hold me

People livin' their lives for you on TV
They say they're better than you and you agree
He says, ""Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls""
Says, ""Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free""
Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill, another cute cheap thrill
You know you love him if you put in your will, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your souls when it comes to the powers now?
Who, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your souls if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

[Verse 2]
We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss 'em
And the cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue
Another day, another dollar, another war
Another tower went up where the homeless had their homes
So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers
But we call religion our friend
We're so worried about saving our souls
Afraid that God will take His toll that we forget to begin, but

[Chorus]
Who will save your soul when it comes to the babies now?
Who, who will save your soul after all those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?
La dee-dee-da, dee-da, dee-da-da, da-la-da

[Verse 3]
Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking their kill
Got social security but it doesn't pay your bills
There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay
So you bargain with the Devil, but you're okay for today, say
That you love them, take their money and run
Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things
Those flings, those strings you've got to cut
So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts

[Chorus]
Who will save-ave your soul when it comes to the babies?
Oh, who will save your souls after those lies that you told, boy?
And who will save-ave your souls if you won't save your own?"

Blow your socks off make sure your G spots soft

Matter fact I can't wait for your candy rain
So whatcha sayin'? I get my swerve on, bring it live
Make it last forever, damn the kitty cat's tight
Mmm... daddy slow down your flow
Put it on me like G baby nice and slow
I need a rough neck nigga, Mandingo in the sack
Who ain't afraid to pull my hair and spank me from the back
No doubt, I'm the playa that you're talkin' about
But do you really think that you can work it out?
I guarantee shorty it's real, baby stick it out

Baby, I wanna hit it in the worst way
Make it hot
Schemin' on the ass since the first day
Don't stop
Damn I love it when you talk like that
Make it bounce sugar
Long as you can bounce me back
More flesh than the Greek Fest
Roll up the sess
Pass the Hennessy
Put my body to the test
Wait wait daddy many niggas ago
I was a young girl listening to how you flow
Now's my chance to hit you off daddy I'm grown
From the back, from the side
Right, I'm in the zone
One of a kind when it's time to do mine
Camcorder and the whole shit
Press rewind
Let it flow on the screen while we puffs the L
Layin back in the cut while we're under the spell
Word life, I like the way the ep went down
Go to sleep, tomorrow I'll take you back downtown
We'll be

Juice, he'll snatch your hoAnd the fat light skinned nigga with braids, he'll fuck you up
Let's go

[Verse]
I'm a straight up menace
I ain't talking 'bout Dennis
Fuck a slingshot
Thing cock it's a nickel plated beam Glock
Straight out the bricks I'm with the business
In the hood making a killing on that cash route
I ain't got time for chilling
I ain't a chump, test if you want
I'll light your ass up like the tip of a blunt
And your mouth on the tip of the pump
Pull the trigger then, watch your top open like the back of a trunk
Pouring hot shit through your back and your front meat
Won't stop dumping 'till you slumped in the front seat
Gun speak, talk's cheap, that's how it is where I be
[?] around the corner pistol in my hand when I sleep
Bodies steady dropping every day of the week
Dog it's nothing new that's how it it is on these streets
The AR, that'll knock your ass off your feet
So gone body left for the pastor to preach
Niggas dying life seem worthless
Been to more funerals, than a church service
Red and blue raggers ride for the purpose
Banging never played out like [?]
Come to the hood, see Glocks jerkin'
Kids sling chrome nigga, one time swervin'
Gangbanging shit never coming to an ending
Whoever started it, that nigga can't finish it
Real talk, gotta watch where you walk
Gotta a maroon colour, your body outlined in chalk
Trunk full of guns, for whoever want drama
Gotta a lot of hand pistols and a lot of Llamas
Got the inf beam on top of the black revolver
Get you 6 shots at a bar like an alcoholic
Niggas scheming and they hate when a nigga balling
My dollar's rising and they funds is steady falling
Fuck em with raps, I'm strapped with a lot of condoms
HIV, that's an uncurable problem
You got a gat, it don't take nothing to pop it
One shot to the head guaranteed to drop 'em
Dot, he'll put five in your face and leave ya
(Chopped and screwed like a Houston mixtape)
Niggas gotta wear bulletproof vests
Niggas wasn't born with a bulletproof chest
Teams getting better so they cutting more cheques
Niggas be hating so we buying more TECs
You bitch niggas, y'all better act right
Yeah my gun's steady smoking like a crack pipe
Woah, my heart cold as popsicle
And I'll [?] your block on a bicycle
Doom Dog, he the captain nigga call me skipper
I'm Gilligan with a gat, I'll leave you crippled
I stay on a mission 187 plenty ammunition
That'll leave a bitch nigga missin', listen huh
I can throw them things, I ain't a punk B
And I roll the dope leave your face all lumpy
Got ballers that shoot straighter than Ginobili
That'll leave you bleeding son, like a ho on a monthly
Yeah, we spending grands monthly
In the trunk, that's where the Mossberg pump be
We got cars roll heavy like tanks
Y'all guns all sterile, y'all be shooting blanks
We don't give a fuck what you think, spit a flame
Afterthought about your brain, should have stayed in your lane
Niggas be shook when the guns is out
Yeah, bullets at your body while some blood come out
Nigga, get low when I blast the 4
Slugs at your head looking like a Sloppy Joe
Give it up nigga, you sloppy joe
Jay Rock came through with a cocky flow
I'm hard, and I'm raw like cocaine
I'm hot like propane, embedded in your head like Rogaine
In high school is was a flunky
I was too busy in the hood serving rock to the junkies
Close your mouth don't front G
I still gotta collect 5 dollars from your auntie
Black jeans 9 ball under the white tee
I'm your pusher man hustling flow like Ice-T
Women think I'm handsome now, all the girls like me
Don't believe me, bitch nigga ask your wifey
Had her in my house she was loving the wood
Had her legs in the air like the kick was good

Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn
Smokin on
Hay in the middle of the barn

[Verse 1]
Sittin on a quarter P of hay, thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up, sippin on some Crown Royal
Trippin, in a circle of wood where everybody smoke they own bud
Good ole' hay, how you feel today? Fine, blowed and dandy
Silly like I'm hype off candy, gotta big, thick chick named sandy
In the farm in the middle of the barn where everybody's feelin crazy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
We constantly, constantly, constantly smokin B's
Too blitzed to even shake it off, but I still got my head up
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Pass the hay you silly slut, blaze it up so I can hit that bud
Get me zoned and i'll be on cause I love to smoke upon hay

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wildstyle]
The hay got me goin through a stage and I just can't get enough
Smokin everyday, I got some hay and you know I'm finna roll it up
Make a cloud, I'm gonna take my mind away from all the bullcrap
Bump my sounds, lay back and roll, mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session, manifesting on my P's and Q's, never snooze cause I refuse
Inhale, exhale the smell, smokin hay all by myself
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride, on my square when time is live
Everybody throw it up, go to the barn and get some hay
When I get my choke on, fool you know I'm smokin on......

[Verse 3]
Hay now hay, we smokin up hay in the middle of the barn
And I'm lit up, can't get up, my eyes are red and my head is spinnin
Took another pull, ridin red bull, got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
Got a posse full of hoes playin in my braids and we bout to get in em
Over yonder is the barn where the pals be at and everything funny
Gotta pause some nigga tryna blow my high smokin all that hay with no money
Now truly this bitch wanna do me, so I hit the 151 Bacardi
She high like the sun, thick like cornbread and I'm ready to party
That hay got me so gotdamn horny but I don't like that tramp
The only reason I'm poppin that coochie cause the ho had a book of foodstamps
And I got the munchies, I need soul food, collard greens or pinto beans
If you smoke hay like the conflict do, then you know what the hell I mean

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Rollin down the block
Car full of flies and the flies tried to rise up out dat door crack
Got my niggas in the barn smokin on that hay stack
Back up on the scene from smokin herb so creep up on the wall and all I heard
Was a bud of mine who dropped a needle in the hay with a funky dime word
Couldn't be myself, couldn't smoke wit nobody else
If I didn't pass it to the left, nigga would have lost my breath
Open up the window 'fore I fall and faint but I can't cause I roll around in dat barn ride
Rollin up the hootie hoo, roughest skin roller on dat west side
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
Nigga what you let them flies out for? Ain't nobody to rich, we poor
Lettin all the contact smoke up in the barn, the flies keep us chokin
Thank you Jesus Christ for all the hay you're givin us cause we'll keep on smokin'

One Blaxican on the squad you don't test
Hittin' hard like an Aztec, swift like a Zulu

[Verse 4: Ives]
Fade it in with snare from ASR-10
Producer mas mejor it's O.G. Style again
Freak it, bump it, bass out the carro
O.G. he's got more BOOM BOOM than Charo
Third of tres brings cuts to your face bro
Hold down the needle with a penny or a peso
See all our style used to create
With one turntable and a broken 808

Oh, I need to know where we stand
Do we share this special thing called love?
I know I do, what about you?
I just can't get enough of the time

[Pre-Chorus: Slim]
I need you in my life
Where do we go?
What do I do?
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you

Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

Never want it to come to an end
Always make me so happy
You'll always have a place in my heart

Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin', milk 'em, top billin'
Silk and pure linen, me and Little Cease
Malibu sea breeze, Dom P's, palm trees
Cats named Pablo in milked out Diablos (That's right)
The Williest, bitches be the silliest
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (Feels good)
Dig up in your middle like Monie (Yes)
Don't know but your settin' up to blow me (Yes)
Try to style, fly up north with a homie (Yes)
Escada, Don Dada, player, stay splurgin'
Game so tight they call it virgin (Yes)

Where do we go
What must I do
If I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby
Like I am the only one for you

[Chorus: 112 & (Slim)]
Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

Girl, I want to be with you
No one else, only you
Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

No one else, only you

Why can't we just make it happen?
Baby, I need you in my life

Girl, I want to be with you
(And I need you, gotta have you in my life, oh yes I do)

No one else, only you"

And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

[Chorus 1]
And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

[Verse 2]
Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

[Chorus 2]
You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

[Bridge]
I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

[Outro]
I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are
Come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name"

649,1996,Lost Boyz,Renee,"[Verse 1]
Here's a tune about this honey named Renee that I met one day
On my way back from John Jay
I'm peeping shorty as she's walking to the train
I tap her on her shoulders
""Excuse me miss, but can I get your name?""
She said, my name is Renee
I said I got a whole lot to say, so may I walk you to your subway?
She said if you want, so yo, we started talking
I bought two franks and two drinks and we began walking
I had to see where that head was at cause her gear was mad fat
So we must chat about this and that
She told me what she was in school for
She wants to be a lawyer, in other words, shorty studies law
I'm telling shorty I'm a writer
And as she's looking for the token, she drops a package of the EZ Wider
Covers her mouth with her name ring
I said, yo don't sweat the technique, shorty rocks, I do the same thing
But yet I use Philly blunts
She said, ""I never dealt with Philly blunts
Because I heard that's for silly stunts""
I said nah they burn slower
Right now I really don't know ya
But maybe later on, I can get to show you

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 2]
So now we sitting on the train
Besides her fingernails, now shorty got the hairdo of pain
Now understand she got flava
A tough leather jacket with some jeans and a chain that her moms gave her
Got off the train about 6:34
She wasn't sure she had grub for the dog, so we hit the store
Went to the crib and turned the lights on
A mad magazine stand
From Essence to Right On
A leather couch, stereo system with crazy CDs
Understand, kid, she got G's
She said Cheeks, do what you want
She said I'm gonna feed the dog
I said, alright well I'ma roll this blunt
She came back with stretch pants and a ponytail, a t-shirt
A yo, fam I got a tender-roni girl
We're sitting on the couch chatting
We're smoking blunts off the balcony
We're staring at Manhattan now
She started feeling on my chest
I started feeling on the breasts
And there's no need for me to stress the rest
A yo, I got myself a winner
We sparked a blunt before we ate and a blunt after we ate dinner
She had a tattoo she only wanted go to see
But first dim the lights and turn up the Jodeci
I'm like whatever, shorty rock, we can swing it like that
'Cause on the real this is where it's at

[Hook]
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty
A ghetto love is the law that we live by
Day by day I wonder why my shorty had to die
I reminisce over my ghetto princess everyday
Give it up for my shorty

[Verse 3]
I woke up the next day on the waterbed
A letter's on the pillow and this what the letter said
It said, ""Cheeks, I'll be home around two
You was deep in your sleep so I didn't want to bother you""
I left my number for shorty to call me later
Got dressed, smoked a blunt, and then I bounced towards the elevator
I got a beep around three
I'm asking shorty what's up with you, she's asking what's up with me
And now we been together for weeks
Candlelight dinner with my shorty, crack a forty with my naughty freaks
Hey man, I never been in love
But every time I'm burstin' in and outta state, it's Shorty that I'm thinking of
I'm hanging out with my crew
I get a beep from Renee because Renee uses Code Two
But yet I'm chattin' with her mom dukes
She says ""Renee has been shot, so Cheeks, meet me up at St. Luke's""
I jumps on the Van Wyck, I gotta make it there quick
Ay yo , this shit is gettin' mad thick
Not even thinking about the po-nine
I'm doing a buck, who gives a fuck, I'm smokin' boom and the whole nine
I gotta see what's going on
But by the time I reach the hospital, they tell me ""Mr. Cheeks, Renee is gone""
I'm pouring beer out for my Shorty who ain't here
I'm from the ghetto, so listen, this is how I shed my tears

A ghetto love is the law that we live by

Live on in time forever
Those dreams
You want with all your heart

And I'll do whatever it takes
Follow through with the promise I made
Put it all on the line
What I hoped for at last would be mine

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
From that one moment in my life
I'm gonna be stronger
Know that I've tried my very best
I'd put my spirit to the test
If I could reach

Some days
Are meant to be remembered
Those days
We rise above the stars

So I'll go the distance this time
Seeing more the higher I climb
That the more I believe
All the more that this dream will be mine

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
From that one moment in my life
I'm gonna be stronger
Knowing that I've tried my very best
I'd put my spirit to the test
If I could reach

If I could reach, higher
Just for one moment touch the sky
That one moment in my life
I'm gonna be stronger
I'm gonna be so much stronger
Yes I am

If I could, if I could

A statistic, everybody's gon' call ballistic
If you had a good day, damn, I must have missed it
Cause you mad at the Universe
Going to hell with everybody else cause you want your own first
I got the urge to let you in on a little secret
Cause you keep dying if I keep it
All the keeling that you're feeling is from within
For the copper check the color of your skin
Why lie? I couldn't try even if I had to
Born with the bullet-proof vest when I had you
A black woman trying to get through to the few

I rather do wrong making that loopy and that hustler
Instead of hot-dogs I'm eating porks up in their smother
And got a gang of loot up in the safe up in my covers
On top of all that I push big fat Lex
And got my hoes that in golf course just in case I feel like flexing
So I must ask, for real though, who are you
See, I'm a big man

Yeah, you know you'se a big man, check it
I went for twelve years to school and never could read
A knowledge of my hood is something they can never teach me
I never started to step but I kept up with the Joneses
Having rollers... my little pinky ring
I did a lot of kinky thing the girls knew it, flock into it
I'm around my old way, yeah, they still wants to do it

But the money in your pocket and if you're down like that

The last few years I watched while you were sheading
Pounds and pounds on growth for the population
Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation
A shooting here, a stabbing there nowhere to stop
Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock
I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong
And try to press on
It's not a white man's finger on the trigger
Car-jacks, drive-by's, callin' each other ""nigga""
I'm not here to scold but rather shape n' mold
That young black mind that won't live to grow old
Cause you're fronting smoking on the blunt and
Down with your friends cause you think you're making ends
But you're not - and that's the truth of the matter

Your molecules are now in motion
Hypnotic effect
So check the way you move on your complexes

[Hook: Chino XL]
Inferiority complex, I got you carrying Glocks and tecs
And got you feeling hesitant to step on stage and represent

[Verse 1: Chino XL]
It's your complex that rips and wrecks your confidence
Creates paranoias inside of your mind when you rhyme
The term Chino's Latin, but I got black soul
Flows I create's unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Bullet holes through the shields of your Land Cruiser
My clique is stoned like they eyes gazed upon Medusa
Makin this picture clearer, it gets weirder than incest
Knowledge my name, I'm on a different plane like Herve Villachez
Getting the people hyped like Monday Night at the Improv
Dive in Ricki's lake plus I rush like Limbaugh
I will detach your limbs, there ain't no wins if you test mine
You won't be coming back again like Sinbad's sitcom
I think they wanna battle
You blew up like Roseanne's belly
Your style's too old to do me like Aaliyah and R. Kelly
Fear and superstition could get iller than circumcision
And things could get more ugly than Coolio when his hair frizzin
My mind's a Warfield like Marsha or Justin
Psychosis be exploding by spontaneous combustion (kill all my)
Kill all my complexes make any crowd scream and yell
Oppose and catch a bullet in your back like Philip Pannell
It's your complex that makes you buy a fake Rolex
To impress the next big butt big breast like it's a contest
Materialistic complex, I make you worship an Ac' or Lex'
Now that you're feel inadequate you're cashin checks for sex
But see, I'm from a small town called (bitch please)
So don't seize the thought
Now see she's caught, go see your daddy for child support
Your complex it got your mind inside a group home
I got you puttin that suit on
Fuck them crabs you spend your loot on
Euphorically, categorically, Chino rips shit historically
*inhale*
Puff you like sensi, rob your shit like Jodeci
Better hope your girl don't notice me
You was a platinum artist 'til the complex got into ya
But I spread new rap styles like prostitutes spread chlamydia
Grammy nominee, wit yaself you ain't in harmony
Now I'm hearing you wanna bring it on to me
Fresh off your tour you don't want no verbal war
Better stay in your Lexus
I was creating metaphors this morning while you were selecting
Which credit card to pay for that bitch's breakfast with
Your car is painted like the Sistine Chapel
But you still couldn't get a piece of that bitch's ass
If you had a scalpel
I'm rough as HELL, CRUSH YOUR CREW, turn you into beetles
Eat a porcupine, PUH, spit out the needles
Bzzz bzzz, my shit is fly you can ask anyone
I'm not MTV so I can leave you Dead at 21
People stand amazed (how could you go on a killing craze)
Cause my heart is blacker than the cotton fields in the slavery days
Fuck friends long as a bitch bends like Mercedes
Invade your mental like U.S. troops invaded Haiti's
Ladies, that are Latin be lovin me more than Desi Arnez but
My voice be aggravatin bitches like Rosie Perez SO
I breaks a virgin's hymen open like the seventh seal
""I'm givin them, somethin, they, can feel""
I explore a woman's vaginal region like Lewis and Clark (please douche)
I might decide to eat the bush like Sandra Bernhardt
Now even the Japanese girls wanna blow me like I'm Sony
But like Mike and that Presley bitch, the relationship is phony (phony)
So baby we can do it, take your time, do it right
The whole game's like Ritchie Valens it should never take flight (uh-huh)
I don't need gold singles to purchase phallic symbols
I keep my Queen, you keep chasin materialistic bitches, yo

Wreckin this it's your complex
They got you feelin mad depressed
You can't rest, from the stress
Wondering what they gonna do next

Your complex is the wall they got your back up against
Intense pressure got you feelin like without em you just worthless
The term Chino
Goes synonymous with corpses flipped
But never celebrated like Hanukkah in Auschwitz
My complex flips
Where'd he get that vain kind of mindframe?
Cause I've been rippin this way since MC's was just a labor pain
Underground for far too long but now I will be surfacin
Spray from my brain on the train -- like Colin Ferguson
They say I go too far but pop radio playin me
Like FCC stands for -- Fuckin Chino's Crazy
But I make TLC stand for They Love Chino when I terrify
You'll never eat Chili cuz I'm an arsonist like Left-Eye
But I can't forget I, heard you say you'll leave me deceased, PLEASE
That's famous last words like the I Have a Dream speech
Beats fat like Melodie sweet like Bellamy
You're gellin me more than niggas at PMD shows be yellin for E
They try to diss cuz I don't have that, I have this (chances are)
They tryin to make me soft like Johnny Mathis
Fuck strike a nerve, I massacre strike a main vein
One line from my brain could turn Bar Mitzvah's into Soul Train
""But I'm still standin"", keepin straight
And marijuana helped me to escape like it was Al Cowlings
Still rippin shit, no videos and no Source ad
I live the type of life that could make Hammer say It's All Bad (hahahaha)
Put it on, one class of car that I can afford has not been built
I can't afford cookies, that's even though I'm labelmates with Milk
It's like Wayne's World cuz they say that ""I'm not worthy!""
My company is fuckin me like Arsenio does Eddie Murphy
Industry kills, I go for the throat
I treat you all like Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston's marriage-
One big joke

It's your complex that got your carryin Glocks and tecs
It's your complex that got you cashin checks for sex
It's your complex why you scared of what I'm gonna say next

Tell me am I very far?

And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God

How our shoes make hard noises in this place
Our clothes are stained

And ask her why we're who we are
Tell me all your thoughts on God

Last night, I slept alone - I stayed at home
For the first time since you've been gone, baby...
No friends to understand, to lend a helping hand
To ease the greatest pain I've ever known...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...
But you went away, baby, and it's such a shame;
How could you turn your back on me? Oh...

I gave, gave everything a man could ever need;
I was there whenever you would call me, baby...
But somehow, your feelings changed, you don't act the same;
I guess you're not the man that I once knew at all...

How you walked away so easily still remains a mystery to me;
Don't you remember that you promised me? Yes, you promised me that you'd never leave, boy...

That I'm not the one who can fill your every need... (Fill your need...)
I painted a picture so clear, it's reality; (Reality...)
Now I know, yes, I know, that you're not the one for me...

When we were young
And truth was paramount
We were older then
And we lived our life without any doubt
Those memories
They seem so long ago
What's become of them?
When you feel like me, I want you to know

[Hook]
Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

[Verse 3]
Today I dreamed
Of friends I had before
And I wonder why
The ones who care don't call anymore
My feelings hurt
But you know I overcome the pain
And I'm stronger now
There can't be a fire unless there's a flame

[Hook]
Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

[Bridge]
Limousines and sycophants
Don't leave me now, cause I'm afraid
What you've done to me
Is now the wolf in my bed
In my head
In my head
In my head

[Verse 4]
The challenges, we took were hard enough
They get harder now
Even when we think that we've had enough
Don't feel alone
Cause it's I you understand
I'm your sedative
Take a piece of me whenever you can

[Hook]
Don't cry, you're not alone
Don't cry tonight, my baby
Don't cry, you'll always be loved
Don't cry tonight, my baby

(I hear your voice on the phone)
(Tonight sweet baby)
(I hear you feel, so alone)

[Outro]
My baby

Don't cry tonight
You'll still be loved"

I know you're alone
I watched the car leave
Your lover is gone

Open your back door
I just need to touch you
Once more
Oh, oh...

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe

I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
To see you again
I want to come over

I know your friend
You told her about me
She filled you with fear
Some kind of sin
How can you turn
Denying the fire
Lover I burn
Let me in

Open your back door
I just need to touch you
Once more
Oh, oh...

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me

Oh...

I know you're confused
I know that you're shaken
You think we'll be lost
Once we begin
I know you're weak
I know that you want me
Lover don't speak
Let me in

I want to come over
To hell with the consequence
You told me you loved me
That's all I believe

I want to come over
It's a need I can't explain
I want to come over
To see you
To see you again"

No Gucci shoes - or designer boots
I've tried the latest lines from A to Z
But there's just one thing that looks good on me

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

I'm not satisfied with Versace style
Put those patent leather pants - in the circular file
Sometimes I think - I might be lookin' good
But there's only one thing that fits like it should

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

Yeah it's you - it could only be you
Nobody else will ever do
Ya baby it's you - that I stick to
Ya we stick like glue

The only thing I want
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you

The only thing I want - Yeah
The only thing I need
The only thing I choose
Yeah - The only thing that looks good on me - Is you"

The way you kissed me
The way you moved me

Another night finds me alone
In my dreams
You still touch me
Your picture by my telephone
In that smile
You still thrill me
And if I sleep
I sleep here alone
In my bed tonight
You still haunt me
And if I'm falling
I'm falling like a stone
In my nightmares
You still hold me

And after all that we've been through
Now I'm wondering
If you still blame me
If only half of this was true
That you believe of me
You still shame me

Dark rain will fall until I see your face
I close my eyes
I seem to hear the raindrops saying
You won't come back
You still touch me

And when I'm sick at heart and low
In my prayers
You still heal me
When I'm so sure, so sure this isn't so
In my complacency
You still shake me

I wonder if you feel the same way as I do
And you'd come back
You still touch me

In my bed tonight

You still hold me
You still touch me
You still touch me
You still touch me

Just hanging out

You turned to me as you were
Threading daisies on a chain
And you said, ""It's decision time again""

As if they're made of cold, cold steel

Can't move my arms
Can't lift my hands
I won't admit to where I am
But I know baby

I'm in chains
I'm in chains

I pretend I can always leave
Free to go whenever I please
But then the sound of my desperate calls
Echo off these dungeon walls

I've crossed the line from mad to sane
A thousand times and back again

You live to die and die to live, that shit is all optional
Listen, you either with it or you isn’t
Here to fuck with my family? I ain’t scared to go to prison

This a warning boy, you entering a haunted house (Don’t be afraid)
Nigga don’t fear it just respect it, adhere to the lesson nigga
(Don’t be afraid) Y’all niggas scared of a gun
My aunt told me fear stand for fuck everything and run

Back to back wine toasts
Yesterday I went to sleep and fucked a fine ghost
In and out my mind Mos
Lee got me in the middle of rhyming my business
Rap gods please forgive us, all of us sinners
Still get a verse full of venom off

I have a harder time with taxes
Knocking the earth off its axis

All my niggas live above the law
You scared of something nigga? Whatchu duckin’ under covers for?

675,1996,"""Weird Al"" Yankovic",Amish Paradise,"[Verse 1]
As I walk through the valley where I harvest my grain
I take a look at my wife and realize she's very plain
But that's just perfect for an Amish like me
You know, I shun fancy things like electricity
At 4:30 in the mornin' I'm milkin' cows
Jebediah feeds the chickens and Jacob plows, fool
And I've been milkin' and plowin' so long that
Even Ezekiel thinks that my mind is gone
I'm a man of the land, I'm into discipline
Got a Bible in my hand and a beard on my chin
But if I finish all of my chores, and you finish thine
Then tonight we're gonna party like it's 1699

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
I've churned butter once or twice
Living in an Amish paradise
It's hard work and sacrifice
Living in an Amish paradise
We sell quilts at discount price
Living in an Amish paradise

[Verse 2]
A local boy kicked me in the butt last week
I just smiled at him and I turned the other cheek
I really don't care, in fact I wish him well
'Cause I'll be laughing my head off when he's burning in Hell
But I ain't never punched a tourist even if he deserved it
An Amish with a 'tude? You know that's unheard of
I never wear buttons but I got a cool hat
And my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool
If you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears
We haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years
But we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare
We're just technologically impaired

[Bridge]
There's no phone, no lights, no motorcar
Not a single luxury
Like Robinson Crusoe
It's as primitive as can be

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're just plain and simple guys
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no time for sin and vice
Living in an Amish paradise
We don't fight, we all play nice
Living in an Amish paradise

[Verse 3]
Hitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter
Raised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another
Think you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?
Well, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art
I'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like
On my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife
So don't be vain and don't be whiny
Or else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie

[Chorus]
We been spending most our lives
Living in an Amish paradise
We're all crazy Mennonites
Living in an Amish paradise
There's no cops and traffic lights
Living in an Amish paradise
But you'd probably think it bites
Living in an Amish paradise

People do it every day
You can see them living sensibly with lots of care
Lonely in a cautious way

You be alone for me
I'll be alone for you
One and one people alone make two
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all
Then take no chance at all

I would rather sit here by myself
Then settle down with someone safe and sound
I kinda like a little trouble every now and then
Someone with enough to break ground

You take a look for me
I'll take a look for you
We'll find it's not so bad it's just new
Let's stir things up a bit
Throw the pieces up to the sky

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news
We will just get up again start over on the count of ten
And if we scar or if we break
It will be our own mistake
Put it down to what we know
Then have another go

And take another chance
And just begin again
Run your finger through the flame
And i will do the same
Together we will fall
Together we will rise
Together we will do everything
But compromise

Baby i want scary kisses
I want hits and i want misses
I want hell and i want bliss
And that stuff between it
And you gave me safety and
The showtime all that drove me crazy
I would rather run and fall then take no chance at all

And if we break or if we bruise
It won't be the worst of news
We will just get up again start over on the count of ten

'Cause she's black, my family would put her down
I'll break the white-trash ties that bind
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind

She said, she said
""Forget the fact that I don't look like you.""

Now everybody talkin' 'bout they blastin', hmm
Is you bustin' steel or is you flashin'? Hmm
Talkin' out yo' asshole

Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect ya neck, my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year 'round from June to June

Hard-hat, protect the dome
Look at mama's baby boy actin' like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee that be holdin' down his honeycomb, loungin', son
Wu brother number one
Protect your neck, flyin' guillotines, here they come
Bloody bastards, hard times and killer tactics
Spittin' words plus semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
Hit the clutch, shift the gear, now full throttle
Time to bungee to the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spittin' lunghies
At a wack nigga that don't understand the fact

Baby, what can I do just to get through to you
My head is spinning around
Feelings turning to blue
Baby don't you know it's true

I walk each day down the street where you live
I've waited for the right time
Something's gotta give
I'd try to say it
But the words come out wrong
So listen while I sing you this song

Here is my heart
Here is my soul
Take what you want, baby
Don't ever let go
'Cause every little thing that I do
I do it for the love of

Every time that you hurt
You know I'm feeling it too, baby
Don't you know it's right
'Cause every day that I live
I dedicate it to you each and every night

I tried to play it time after time
But the kind of rush you give me
I could never hide
So listen to these words that I say
Won't let you go, no how, no way

Here is my heart
Here is my soul
Take what you want, baby
Don't ever let go

What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane
When all the money stops

I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ask my ma pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto

[Chorus: Flaj]
What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

[Verse 2: Bushwick Bill]
Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'mma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rwanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto

[Verse 3: Willie D]
What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
Cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta
Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine
Muthafucka

What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay

709,1997,Az Yet Featuring Peter Cetera,Hard To Say I'm Sorry,"[Verse 1: Darryl & Kenny]
Everybody needs a little time away
I heard her say, from each other
Even lovers need a holiday
Far away from each other

[Chorus 1: Marc]
Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to stay
And after all that you've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you, baby
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

[Verse 2: Shawn]
Couldn't stand to be kept away
Not for a day, from your body
Wouldn't want to be swept away
Far away from the one that I love

[Chorus: Kenny, Peter Cetera & Marc]
Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry
I just want you to know
Hold me now, I really want to tell you I'm sorry
I could never let you go
And after all that we've been through
I will make it up to you, I promise you
And after all that's been said and done
You're just a part of me I can't let go

I can't let go"
710,1997,Savage Garden,I Want You,"[Verse 1]
Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain; I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball
That I need to, I want to

[Bridge]
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

[Chorus]
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out

[Verse 2]
I'm the kind of person who endorses a deep commitment
Getting comfy, getting perfect is what I live for
But a look, then a smell of perfume
It's like I'm down on the floor and I don't know what I'm in for
Conversation has a time and place
In the interaction of a lover and a mate
But the time of talking, using symbols, using words
Can be likened to a deep sea diver
Who is swimming with a raincoat

[Bridge]
Come stand a little bit closer
Breathe in and get a bit higher
You'll never know what hit you
When I get to you

[Chorus]
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Anytime I need to see your face, I just close my eyes
And I am taken to a place where your crystal mind
And magenta feelings take up shelter in the base of my spine
Sweet like a chic-a-cherry cola
I don't need to try to explain
I just hold on tight
And if it happens again, I might move so slightly
To the arms and the lips and the face of the human cannonball
That I need to, I want to

[Chorus]
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (So can we find out?)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but
Ooh, I'd die to find out
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you but
Ooh, I'd die to find out (I'd die to find out)
Ooh, I want you, I don't know if I need you, but

One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Oh, you get me ready
In your '56 Chevy
Why don't we go sit down in the shade?
Take shelter on my front porch
The dandelion sun scorching
Like a glass of cold lemonade

[Pre-Chorus]
I will do the laundry
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Verse 2]
Why don't you stay the evening?
Kick back and watch the TV
And I'll fix a little something to eat
Oh, I know your back hurts
From working on the tractor
How do you take your coffee, my sweet?

[Pre-Chorus]
I will raise the children
If you pay all the bills

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?

[Bridge]
I am wearing my new dress tonight
But you don't, but you don't even notice me
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes
Say our goodbyes

[Verse 3]
We finally sell the Chevy
When we had another baby
And you took that job in Tennessee
You made friends at the farm
And you join them at the bar
Almost every single day of the week

[Pre-Chorus]
I will wash the dishes
While you go have a beer

[Chorus]
Where is my John Wayne?
Where is my prairie song?
Where is my happy ending?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where is my Marlboro Man?
Where is his shiny gun?
Where is my lonely ranger?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?
Where have all the cowboys gone?"
713,1997,Meredith Brooks,Bitch,"[Verse 1]
I hate the world today
You're so good to me, I know, but I can't change
Tried to tell you but you look at me like maybe
I'm an angel underneath
Innocent and sweet

Yesterday I cried
You must have been relieved to see the softer side
I can understand how you'd be so confused
I don't envy you
I'm a little bit of everything all rolled into one

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

[Verse 2]
So take me as I am
This may mean you'll have to be a stronger man
Rest assured that when I start to make you nervous
And I'm going to extremes
Tomorrow I will change and today won't mean a thing

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

[Bridge]
Just when you think you got me figured out
The season's already changing
I think it's cool, you do what you do
And don't try to save me

[Chorus]
I'm a bitch, I'm a lover
I'm a child, I'm a mother
I'm a sinner, I'm a saint
I do not feel ashamed
I'm your Hell, I'm your dream
I'm nothing in between
You know you wouldn't want it any other way

[Chorus 2]
I'm a bitch, I'm a tease
I'm a goddess on my knees
When you hurt, when you suffer
I'm your angel undercover
I've been numb, I'm revived
Can't say I'm not alive
You know I wouldn't want it any other way"

717,1997,Duncan Sheik,Barely Breathing,"[Verse 1]
I know what you're doing, I see it all too clear
I only taste the saline when I kiss away your tears
You really had me going, wishing on a star
But the black holes that surround you are heavier by far
I believed in your confusion, you were so completely torn
It must've been that yesterday was the day that I was born
There's not much to examine, there's nothing left to hide
You really can't be serious, you have to ask me why
I say goodbye

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay

[Verse 2]
And everyone keeps asking, what's it all about?
I used to be so certain and I can't figure out
What is this attraction, I can only feel the pain
There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame
Will it ever change?

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

[Bridge]
I've come to find I may never know
Your changing mind, is it friend or foe
I rise above or sink below
With every time you come and go
Please don't come and go

[Chorus]
'Cause I am barely breathing and I can't find the air
Don't know who I'm kidding, imagining you care
And I could stand here waiting, a fool for another day
I don't suppose it's worth the price, you're worth the price, the price that I would pay
But I'm thinking it over anyway
I'm thinking it over anyway

You must think I'm stupid or either blind girl

How come your best friend told me the dude's name was Ken? (Whatever)
You better get it together, cuz whenever you lie?

720,1997,Joe,"Don't Wanna Be A Player (From ""Booty Call"")","[Intro: Too $hort]
Nah, baby
I don't think I wanna be a player no mo'
I done been through a lot of hoes
Lot of women, lot of bitches, lot of relationships
All the drama
Tryin' to find a real one, baby

[Chorus: SNL]
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
There comes a time in every player's life
When you think about a family and havin' a wife
You had enough, you can't take this shit
Put a end to all the meaningless relationships
And find one that means everything
I'm talkin' 'bout white dresses and wedding rings
Used to be strip clubs and the Bunny Room
But now you're in love on a honeymoon
You used to keep a extra chick
Just for booty calls and sexy trips
But now you at the grocery sto'
Target, Wal-Mart, and Home Depot
If you break out of prison, and jump the wall
You couldn't even get a date, you wouldn't know who to call
You had a lot of women and you played 'em hard
But you retired now, give up that player card

[Chorus: SNL]
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
A lot of players called it quits
Come across the love pit and fall in it
Ain't nothin' wrong with love
Early in the morning you just want a hug
I've been there a million times
Ask me how I'm doin', I'm feelin' fine
But really what I feel inside
Is the need to have somethin' real in my life
I had it before
But I'm like Cameo, I go ""Back and Forth""
Like Big Pun and Joe
Sometimes ""I don't wanna be a player no more""
And when the time comes around, you know what's next
Throw away my phone and my Rolodex
It's gone, and I didn't even notice it
My player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch

[Chorus: SNL]
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Your player card got revoked
And it can't be renewed - no, it's not a joke
Once you give it up, it's hard to get it back
'Cause fallin' in love is like hittin' crack
One hit and you a junkie
All day and night you'll be lickin' that monkey
You love the way it's sticky and funky
You said, ""I don't wanna live, if she don't want me""
I never had days like that
'Cause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks
I gotta get that scratch
I get it from a batch, or from my raps
It's gon' happen, 'cause the game is here
Ask Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player
You know when love'll happen for me?
When I start buyin' hookers, and rappin' for free
Never!

[Chorus: SNL]
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Then show me who you really are
If you don't wanna be a player no more
Turn in your player card

[Outro: Too $hort]
It ain't expired yet, baby
I'm thinkin' 'bout renewin' it
Short Dog in the house
PFL - Player For Life
Player For Life, baby
Sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be a player
But I am...

Smoke one wit'cha potna, mayne
You in the mix with Too $hort, ""Still Blowin'""
New album comin soon, baby
What's my favorite word?"

722,1997,White Town,Your Woman,"[Verse 1]
Just tell me what you've got to say to me
I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth
It comes as no surprise at all you see
So cut the crap and tell me that we're through
Now I know your heart, I know your mind
You don't even know you're being unkind
So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways
Just use me up and then you walk away
Boy, you can't play me that way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

[Chorus]
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

[Verse 2]
When I saw my best friend yesterday
She said she never liked you from the start
Well me, I wish that I could claim the same
But you always knew you held my heart
And you're such a charming, handsome man
Now I think I finally understand
Is it in your genes
I don't know
But I'll soon find out, that's for sure
Why did you play me this way

[Pre-Chorus]
Well I guess what you say is true
I could never be the right kind of girl for you

[Chorus]
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman
I could never be your woman

She'll let you in her house
If you come knocking late at night
She'll let you in her mouth
If the words you say are right
If you pay the price
She'll let you deep inside
But there's a secret garden she hides

[Verse 2]
She'll let you in her car
To go driving around
She'll let you into the parts of herself
That will bring you down
She'll let you in her heart
If you got a hammer and a vise
But into her secret garden, don't think twice

[Bridge]
You've gone a million miles
How far would you get
To that place where you can't remember
And you can't forget

[Verse 3]
She'll lead you down a path
There will be tenderness in the air
She'll let you come just far enough
So you know she's really there
Then she'll look at you and smile
And her eyes will say
She's got a secret garden
Where everything you want
Where everything you need
Will always stay
A million miles away"

Summer stretching on the grass
Summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree
Creeps a-crawling over me
Over me and over you
Stuck together with God's glue
It's gonna get stickier too
It's been a long hot summer
Let's get under cover
Don't try too hard to think
Don't think at all

[Chorus]
I'm not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you take a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb
I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind

[Verse 2]
There's an insect in your ear
If you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you wanna see what the scratching brings?
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach
Will we ever live in peace?
Cause those that can't do often have to
And those that can't do often have to preach

[Chorus]
To the ones
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'll find
If you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb
Staring at the sun
I'm not the only one
Who'd rather go blind

[Verse 3]
Intransigence in all around
Military's still in town
Armour plated suits and ties
Daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle
God is good but will he listen?
I'm nearly great but there's something missing
I left it in the duty free
Oh, though you never really belonged to me

[Chorus]
You're not the only one
Staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find
If you stepped back inside
I'm not sucking my thumb
Staring at the sun
Not the only one
Who's happy to go blind"

Nah, nah, nah
Nah, this can't be true

Now don't try to tell me things are still the same, yeah

732,1997,Sheryl Crow,Everyday Is A Winding Road,"[Verse 1]
I hitched a ride with a vending machine repair man
He said he's been down this road more than twice
He was high on intellectualism
I've never been there, but the brochure looks nice

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

[Chorus]
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

[Verse 2]
He's got a daughter, he calls Easter
She was born on a Tuesday night
I'm just wondering why I feel so all alone
Why I'm a stranger in my own life

Jump in, let's go
Lay back, enjoy the show
Everybody gets high, everybody gets low
These are the days when anything goes

Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer

I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a winding road
I get a little bit closer
Everyday is a faded sign
I get a little bit closer to feeling fine

[Bridge]
I've been swimmin' in a sea of anarchy
I've been living on coffee and nicotine
I've been wondering if all the things I've seen
Were ever real, were ever really happening (Really happening)

733,1997,Bee Gees,Alone,"[Verse 1]
I was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke
I could make a woman hang on every single stroke
I was an iron man, I had a master plan
But I was alone

[Verse 2]
I could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind
I remember how your body started trembling
Oh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in
I'm still alone

[Bridge]
And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Somehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)
Always end up alone

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
Cause you know that love takes time
We came so far
Just the beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Verse 3]
Well, since I got no message on your answer phone
Since you're busy every minute I just stay at home
I make believe you care, I feel you everywhere
But I'm still alone

[Verse 4]
I'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate
Cause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?
Am I the subject of the pain? Am I the stranger in the rain?
I am alone

And if there glory there to behold
Maybe it's my imagination
Another story there to be told

[Chorus]
So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

And all the wonders made for the earth
And all the hearts in all creation
Another story there to be told

So I play, I'll wait
And I pray it's not too late
We made it so far
Just a beat of a lonely heart
And it's mine
And I don't want to be alone

[Outro]
Gone but not out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home
Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean
And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home

Face the heat of the night
The one that you love got a heart that's made of stone

Shine and search for the light
And sooner or later you'll be cruising on your ocean

And clean out of sight
I'm caught in the rain and there's no one home"
734,1997,Kenny Lattimore,For You,"For you I give a lifetime of stablility
Anything you want of me
Nothing is impossible

For you there are no words
Or ways to show my love
Or all the thoughts I'm thinking of

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one
I've made a change
Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do is for you

For you I share the cup of love that overflows
And anyone who knows us knows
That I would change all faults I have for you
There is no low or high or in between
Of my heart that you Haven't seen

'Cause I share all I have and am
Nothing I've said is hard to understand
All I feel I feel deeper still
And always will all this love is for you

Every note that I play
Every word I might say
Every melody I feel
Are only for you and your appeal

Every page that I write
Everyday of my life
Would not be filled without the things
That my love for you now brings

For you I'd make a promise of fidelity
Now and for eternity
No one could replace this vow
For you I'd take your hand and heart
And everything and add to them a wedding ring

'Cause this life is no good alone
Since we've become one you're all I know
If this feeling should leave I'd die and here's why
All I am is for you

Everything I do now makes sense
All roads end, all I do...
Is for you
Only for you"

Wearing nothing is Divine
Naked is a state of mind
I take things off to clear my head
To say the things I haven't said
Live inside the elements
The earth and sky are my best friends
Water is the evidence
That washes me from end to end

With my naked eye
I saw all the falling rain
Coming down on me
With my naked eye
I saw all
If I said it all, I could see

It's not a choice I tried to make
It's not a thought I couldn't take
Something told me it was time
To give you yours and leave me mine

I knew the day I knew the night
I knew I could regain my sight

I'm out of tears
My heart's got no room left inside

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

Will the arms of hope surround me
Will time be a fair weather friend
Should I call out to angels
Or just drink myself sober again

Can't hide it, it's true
I still burn for you
Your memory just won't let me go

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

I'd hold you tighter
Closer than ever before
Yeah
No flame would burn brighter
If I could touch you once more
Hold you once more

How many dreams will end
How long can I pretend
How many times will love pass me by
Until I find you again

Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you
How to live again

I wanna be there when you're feeling high
I wanna be there when you wanna die
I'm gonna light your fire, I'm gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when you're feeling down
And I'll be there when your head is spinnin 'round
Gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I wanna be there til the end

You wouldn't know that I was there
Cause I have been there all the time
And if I had my way I'd hold you in my arms
And leave this madness all behind

Cause you got so much to give
But you throw it all away
And all you've got to show for
Who you are is pain

And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take the time
To show you I'm a friend
You'll believe in love again

I wanna be there in the pouring rain
I wanna be there when you call my name
Gonna light your fire, I'm gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when I'm outta town
And when your whole damn world is crashing down
I'm gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I'm wanna be there til the end

Cause you don't know what you have
Til your everything is gone
You need someone to show you
How to live again

And I've got so much to give
If you'd only let me in
I'm gonna take the time
To show you I'm a friend
You'll believe again

I wanna be there when your baby cries
I wanna be there when they tell you lies
I'm gonna light your fire, gonna feel your flame
I wanna be there when you go insane
I wanna be there when your nights are long
And when you're feeling like you don't belong
Gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
Gonna be there til the end

I'm gonna be there in the morning
I'm gonna be there in the night
I'm gonna be your lover, gonna be your friend
I'm gonna be there til the end, yeah"
747,1997,Le Click,Call Me,"Call me when you're down
Call me when you need someone
Call me when it's rough
And you think that there's no one

Love just for the understanding
Things that love carries, what we're demanding
Listen to the heart that's beating
Forget about lust and all misleading
Love, talk about me and you
My love just makes everything come true
Questions lies in the heavens and ground
It's up to me and I'll call you when I'm down

I will be true, too many ups and downs with you
I know what to say to you, so here's what I tell you

But 'till you need someone to love
I will be searching for my love

I will, but I will be there for you

Sitting at a park, holding hands at the dark
With a love so strong to break my heart
This is your heart that's beating
Forget about fuss and all misleading
Love, summer, winter, spring or fall
Love is wishing that we had it all
Questions lies in the skies and ground
It's up to me and I'll call you when I'm down

I will be there for you...

If you need someone
Call me when you're down
If you need someone
Call me when you're down"
748,1997,Warren G,I Shot The Sheriff,"[Intro: Nanci Fletcher]
Eeee
This town is run by martial law
And Warren G are the marshall
So, Warren G, just pick up yourself everytime
'Cause you don't know I say you rule!

[Chorus: Warren G, (Boogie Down Productions)]
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

[Verse 1: Warren G]
I had to shoot the sheriff it was justifiable
He mistaked me for somebody who was liable
To more than many murders
LA's a war fields
We keep making war shields
Streets keep souls
Young brothers lose control
I seem to maintain through this
Watch where you kick it they'll put you in a twist
And it ain't nobody like my down ass hommie
And tha police always tryin to pin some bullshit on me
I keep away from fools
They do crime and  attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

[Chorus: Warren G, (Boogie Down Productions)]
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

[Verse 2: Warren G]
They tryin' to stick with some shit that I did not do
You know who
The boys in blue
There they go with they assumpitons
Slaverys over let us have somethin'
Why you wanna pull me over?
Cuz I'm bumpin?
I just made a new song
My profession is music
Your profession is protection with gats
Then use it on him when he's tryin' to take my life away
I'm just tryin' to live my life today
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

[Chorus: Warren G, (Boogie Down Productions)]
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

[Verse 3: Warren G]
I shot the sheriff
I didn't shoot the deputiy I didn't have to
Cuz in this game they always tryin' to blast you
And leave it to tha cops to find out who did the murder
They harrase tha wrong clan and arrest tha wrong man
The hommie day-dog got strapped but thats okay
Cuz I'm gonna work for life
So he can see another day
A hommies a hommie
A fake is a snake
Straight game from tha pen from tha hommie jake
So I keep away from fools they do crime it attract cops
Cops got guns and cuffs
And cells to stuff you in

[Chorus: Warren G, (Boogie Down Productions)]
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was)

[Bridge: Nanci Fletcher]
Fire!
Make one shot for da man Warren G
A lick two shot for da G Funk family
A lick three shot for da LBC
A lick four shot for da Jamaican posse

[Chorus: Warren G, (Boogie Down Productions)] x2
(I shot the sheriff)
But I did not shoot the deputy
(All I could think about was war and)

But I did not shoot the deputy

Coming, coming, listen girl

I'm whispering words over your shoulder
Oooh can't you hear
Before you reply the temperature rise
Then like that you disappear
I never imagined
I'd get so excited
Over a rendezvous
I'll be there in an hour still wet from the shower
I just called to tell you

1 - It's on tonight
The feeling's right
We don't have to go nowhere
Listen girl I'm coming over

Rub your back, massage your shoulders
I just wanna lay it on you

2 - Girl can you tell me what's on tonight
I'm coming to your crib
Have dinner by candlelight
And we gonna watch some TV
We gonna play your CD's
I'm gonna be on you
And you're gonna be on me

Repeat 2

I pray that you're wearing Victoria Secrets
Oh, that blows my mind
Now what should I bring
Strawberries I'm thinking
Or some honey for your toes
I never imagined I get so excited
So aroused by you
So click on the cable
I'll put on a slow jam
Montell is coming

Repeat 1

Don't you try to go no where
I just wanna lay it on you

What's the deal
I wanna know is this love for real
Or could it be lust that I feel
You got it going on and on like a real fly sex appeal
Physique extra ill sun sweet dress to kill
You got me open like token hot and smokin
Jacuzzi bubble bath laughin joking
Candle light talking about how you and your ex-man fight
Tropical sight beach sand white listen
Seafood dishes wine cooler champagne wishes waterbed head
Fine do with some riches
Our loveable hugeable I love the cute
As long as I'm around and down nothin could ever trouble you

Chorus:

I want your body the way you touch me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy
Take it slowly heaven hold me
Rather be in your Caddie
You could be my big daddy

Cute face haircut like the Hally design
Keep my day laced up with fly gear and makeup
But you should see her when she wake up never could we brake up
Shop till you drop cause the cream dont stop
Buy you a bunch of outfits your sexy your hot
So she could look good for Hev D
Overweight loving MC rub you gently
You know its C big CEO sex-o-pee

You might feelme creeping to your room late at night
It's hell a waterbed so get it right

Bitch I'm a pimp, I don't speak to no hoes
You niggas never match MC's with no flows
It don't add up, like me with no dough
I swear to God, just last year I was broke
On the block selling dope, watching my niggas snort coke (Now)
My life changed, from the planes to the boats
From the chains to the clothes, don't need Game for these hoes
They just hop in the Range and we go
Switching lanes, baby go'n give me brains on the low
Never lame, born and raised in the Sco
Niggas hate, but they won't say a thing to me though
It's like that, and as a matter of fact
I got powers with the powder, Harry Potter the crack
Every hour I devour, money shower with that
Lemonheads in my ears, how sour is that?
Real sour, I break shit down like Twin Towers
Nabbed ya' bitch, had the bitch, bitch holla
It ain't 'bout dollars? I don't want to hear about it
Never square, boy this nigga right here about it
Call me Ya Boy, for short call me YB
Don't try me, carry gun like I.D
But fuck guns, I keep niggas beside me
And we'll beat a punk nigga down like Rodney
Feel I'm the king when it come to this rap thing
If I ain't have a mic, I probably clap things
Or post all night, serving things to the crack fiends
Boy, I got runners like the coach of the track team
Yes, I'm focused, vision clear as a flat screen
You broke niggas not eating you're fasting
I'm telling you: All the hoods, they feel dude
They like, ""Pac gone, but fuck it, he'll do""
A lot of jealous niggas, they be trying to kill dude
Because the boy pockets green as mildew
And in the west, if I ain't the best
Or at least second, I'll put a weapon up to my chest (Yeah)
Haters don't want to see me breathe
Cause they know I got Next like MTV
They can't see me like bootleg DVDs
'Cause I got more pads than the MPC
Catch me dippin' in a Jag, seaweed green
I'm in a league of my own, you in the pee-wee league
When I was broke, still my grill at least three Gs
Now I talk with a smile, let the VVs breathe
It's Ya Boy, I represent the CDP
You a ho dog, you be were the weenies be
You the man when the east coast talk about ya'
Buzzin' in the streets, each coast speak about ya'
That's me, and if you ain't here
It's 'bout to get ugly, like Freeway's beard
It's the streets, you don't get a lot of leeway here
It get hotter than a motherfuckin' heat wave here
Trust me, boy, it's a lot of heat-play here
Leave you M.I.A. like the Heat play here
Wear guns to surpass the hatin'
Tie the MAC 'round my neck, it's a fashion statement
I laugh at you clowns, thinkin' I'm the same dude
I'm not as quiet as I was back in grade school
I'm much sicker, with an addiction to spray tools
And like a Game, I'm just dyin' to play fools
So run up if you think I'm a chump
I'll leave your body in the trunk, smellin' just like skunk
I'll leave your head in your lap, right after I dump
Even Ashton Kutcher couldn't make your nucka a punk (Ha)
I be thuggin' till I'm at the pearly tall gates
'Cause I've been thuggin' since 20s had a small face
I'm still thuggin' and, 20s got a large face
Ya Boy, the black '06 version of Scarface
And the Bay is where I made my name
Where them niggas go dumb like Damon Wayans
Yeah it's hyphy, but some niggas, they be goin all out
So I don't go dumb 'cause the gun might fall out
Trust me, dog, I'm not the nigga you should call out
I'm looking at your teeth and I'ma knock 'em all out
Twice as big as I was befo'
And the radio won't even play my song no mo'
But It's cool, I'm in the streets like a hydrant though
So when they ask who the best, they reply ""Ya Yo
That nigga Ya Boy, that boy got a fiery flow""
Hoes tryin' to make me they man, my reply is ""No""
Yes, you can get on your knees and blow
And put my thing in your mouth, but easy though
A hot boy, I don't sound like Weezy though
Got snow, but I don't think I got a Jeezy flow
I'm the truth, I could go R&B and blow
But this rap game's so fuckin' easy though
I'm the pizza man, I got cheese and dough
My H-Town niggas got me off leanin' dro
Niggas think I'm a ho, ti'l I squeeze the fo'
And that'll change they mind like Keyshia Cole
And I'm single, somebody let Keyshia know
That I break backs and leave girls leanin', yo (Ha)
The girls choose 'cause my penis better
Not to mention I'm hot like Phoenix weather
Not to mention you cold, you won't even go gold
When I drop, I'ma go platinum times fo'
That's fo' million sales from Florida to Wales
'Cause I got more bars than four million jails
And I'm holding the twelve gauge for you lames
Aim at your brain, leave your membrane rearranged
If you don't think I'm the truth, you retarded
Record labels, get the biddin' war started"

[Verse 1: Gizmo]

Yo suckas fall back
Respect the format
Y'all ain't welcome here
I never liked them stupid door mats
Got strats upon strats to take the earth prime
Lyrics without gimmicks to wake minds up like snorting coke lines
I rhyme crimes divine, personalities intertwine
Swing guillotines smoke amphetamines drink turpentine
The world's mine no rebuttals retorts better check the reports
You face the dark side of the force
Me and panic on nega-mode Negatron
Vandalize Cybertron
Star scream Decepticon
Give me 5 epsilon
Off the grid movie Tron
Pile piles on your pylon
No more voltage for Voltron
Yea yea, either you with it or with it
You ain't with it you get it
When you get it you deaded
Your whole crew catch the edit
Henchmen spraying the leaded
Gas your block with unleaded
And watch Queen Latifah set it off
Don't want to get physical like turn your head and cough
There'll be side effects like you using the drug Zoloft
I zone out but in zones I touch down
A confounded criminal my pros is I know cons
That do jobs for minimal and split wigs with no salons
Freeze
Ice beams wild schemes dreams of treason
Get green weather machine change the seasons
Don't need a reason just want to see the world burn
You're allies get it first so next its gonn' be your turn
I'm earnest your whole squad they earned this
Incinerating bodies putting ashes into urns quick
The furnace
Have them pushing up daisies and turnips
Y'all worthless
Ain't nobody alive here to murder me
Ya'll wasting time tryin' to box against eternity
Hold it down my method call it gravity
Hit tracks with alkaline that's assault and battery

They never learn, They never do
Respect is earned
And thats the truth
Fall back
You don't want the drama
Just stay at home
Kick it with ya baby mama
What you wanna (What you wanna)
What you wanna (What you wanna)
What you wanna (What you wanna)
What you wanna do?

Finger hold, finger hold
All those young garden gnomes
Playing, think we old?
Do what you’re told

This is the part where I talk my shit
About how we walk that shit
Add some bark with it
Got fire tracks that spark visions
Higher than the atmos or the stratus
0.C., we on some Mars missions
And ya'll rap cats is all kittens
And your women's pussy we doggy style
On Morse code we tap it up
So let's wrap it up go head shorty back it up
If the niggas actin up they faces we smackin up
Cracking up while we jacking these fools at melee
Workin' hard to get moms packed up on a vacay
Another niggas wack staying relevant like Ray J
Trying to up they pay grade ain't joking with y’all jay kay
We could give a damn what he, she, or they say
We been outcrowd since the heyday
So make way
And mayday
Kamikaze competition
Call me kami
Got ya wishing
That we finally
Got diminished
Next dimension
For ya'll minions
Crew of degenerates but we been a threat
Killing the game and winning the fame
And reassemble rap
Til we get to the ranks of Shabba Ranks
This think tank ain't tanking
And history is formulating
They say when pigs fly
Well, I see soaring bacon flow been on swine flu
Do I need to remind you my girls sweet as some hai chu
God blessed me with vibes dude
The red barons in flight school
An empires our eyes view
Your hearings impaired and your visions a lie too
Radio ain't prepared they hide too
So how do I devise to take over each side through
Pretending I’m high intending to slide through
Or inventing a guide these niggas can live to
Beat maker is side one and the emcee is side two
Both can kick you from the head to caboose
Breakin' ya down two times
Square to the root, call us the truth and vamoose

My dog won't bite if you sit real still

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say, you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me, you never shut up
Yeah, I can hear that

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts?
Boy, you best pray that I bleed real soon

You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough
To get us there?

For somebody else to understand?
Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by, will I choke on my tears

Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up

Everybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand

766,1997,Joose,If Tomorrow Never Comes,"VERSE 1:
Sometimes late at night
I lie awake and watch her sleeping
She's lost in peaceful dreams
So I turned out the light
As I lay there in the dark
And a thought crosses my mind
If I never wake in the morning
Will she ever doubt
The way I feel about her, in my heart

CHORUS:
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
She's my only one
If my time on earth were through
She must face this world without me
So the love I gave her in the past
Would it be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes

VERSE 2:
Cause I've lost loved ones in my life
Who never knew how much I loved them
Now I live with the regret, that my true feelings for them
Never were revealed
So I made a promise to myself
To say each day how much she means to me
And avoid that circumstance
Where's no second chance
To tell her how I feel

CHORUS:
If tomorrow never comes
Will she know how much I loved her,(how much I loved her)
Did I try in every way
To show her every day
Shes my only one
If my time on earth were through
She must face this world without me
So the love I gave her in the past
Would it be enough to last
If tomorrow never comes
So tell it to someone that you love
Just what you're thinking of
If tomorrow never comes"
767,1997,Paul McCartney,"The World Tonight (From ""Fathers' Day"")","[Spoken]
I'm gonna do a song now about, I'm gonna do a song now about something that happened on July the 13th 1985. I also, no I dedicate this to the, to Mr. Liberal X who uh, who uh videotaped Live Aid so he could watch the edited highlights at Christmas. Didn't have to feel guilty about not giving money. Here we go. 

[Chorus]
Well July the 13th 1985
Was the day we watched Live Aid
The global jukebox came alive
And we fed the world that day
We fed the world that day

[Verse 1]
It was a day for a party
We made a lot of food and we ate it sure as hell
Vegetarian salads they had no meat
There was leftovers as well
Everybody laughed when I said
Thinking of the people either dying or dead
Let's pick up the leftovers
And send them to the starving children in Ethiopia
(My mother used to say that)
Sure I was pleased to give money
'Cause it was not a political cause, no
I just remember the smiling faces
The music and the applause
I spent thirty quid on coke
I smoked a little too much dope, yeah
I was wiped out from five 'til seven
I missed Spandau Ballet and U2, whoa

[Chorus]
It was July the 13th 1985
Was the day we watched Live Aid
The global jukebox came alive
And we fed the world that day
Yeah we fed the world that day
What about the music? Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
The music was fucking brilliant
And that Madonna she sure can move
By the time Paul McCartney's microphone had failed, yeah
We were all well into the Live Aid groove, yeah
Paul McCartney he sang
Well it must have been a bit of an irony
Because if you let it be nothing will ever improve, but
It was one of the first times I ever heard one of the real Beatles singing a real Beatles song live on the television I really wish that Julian Lennon had turned up instead of his recently dead father
I was really moved

[Chorus]
It was July the 13th 1985
Was the day we watched Live Aid
The global pukebox came alive
And we fed the world that day
Yeah we fed the world that day

[Bridge]
Well the powerful force of pop music
Solved the problems feed the world
So what if there weren't any blacks involved
There was Everything But The Girl
Bob Geldof has no ego
That man should get the Nobel Prize
By the time he sang the solo on ""Feed the World""
I thought he should be canonized

[Verse 3]
I felt guilty about the starving but I felt good to be alive
And I must admit I shed a tear or two
In the very moving video for that great Cars song
Drive
Saint Bob made me feel like shit
So I got out an envelope, opened it
Put in a very crisp ten pound note
It was the same one I used earlier to snort my coke
And that made me feel good inside
Sending the money, not snorting the coke

[Chorus]
It was July the 13th 1985
Was the day we watched Live Aid
The global jukebox came alive
And we fed the world that day
I personally with my own ten pound note
Which I used to snort all that coke
Fed the world that day, as on the day

[Outro]
But you can't go on
As if nothing's wrong
Who's gonna take you home?
Oh, that's very harsh (Sing it, sing it!)
That's very harsh
Who's gonna drive you home (Sing it!)
Tonight?
Thanks!"

I'm bout to hit you with that traditional style of cold rockin'
Givin options for head knockin non-stoppin'
Tip-toppin' lyrics we droppin' but styles can be forgotten
So we bring back the raw hip-hoppin'
Just like the records and tapes you be coppin'
Cop some breakdancin', boogie poppin', and lockin'
Tic tockin', guaranteed to have you clockin'
We only get better and only better we have gotten
This type of flow don't even think about stoppin'
Beware, the length of the rhyme flow can be shockin'
All music lovers in the place right now
That never understood the way that KRS got down
Yo, I'm strictly about skills and dope lyrical coastin'
Relying on talent, not marketing and promotion
If a dope lyrical flow is a must
You gots to go with a name you can quickly trust
I'm not sayin I'm number one, uhh I'm sorry, I lied
I'm number one, two, three, four and five
Stop wastin' your money on marketing schemes
And pretty packages pushin' dreams to the fiends
A dope MC is a dope MC
With or witout a record deal, all can see
And that's who KRS be son

Old styles I pass dat, slow down on fast rap
All in yo' ass crack, Cocaine? Don't pass dat
Conjure to ask dat, hyper type of flashback
I publish like ASCAP lyrics for hand clap
No past rappin', youth trackin', talent lackin'
MC's more worried about their financial backin'
Steady packin a gat as if something's gonna happen
But it doesn't, they wind up shootin they cousin, they buggin'
I appear everywhere and nowhere at once
I know my style is bumpin, even though some people front
It's the God of rap, you heard of it
The one that rhymes toward the sky givin airplanes mad turbulence
In rap tournaments, I reign permanent
Don't you think by now the number one spot I'm not concerned with it
The course of rap I'm turnin' it
Back to that good old fashioned way of getting cash money by earning it
No bogus hocus pocus, I bring back to focus
Skills if you notice my position is lotus

And I need to get some rest---yo, where's the cess?

Yes, yes, it was me, I plead guilty
And at the count of three I pull back the duvet
Make my way to the refrigerator
One dry potato inside, no lie, not even bread
Jam, when the light above my head went bam!
I can't see, something's all over me, greasy
Insomnia please release me and let me dream
About making mad love on the heath
Tearing off tights with my teeth
But there's no relief, I'm wide awake in my kitchen
It's black and I'm lonely

Creeky noises make my skin creep

Call me up every single day
They don't work and they don't want to
Come on down to some Damn Cafe

Bobie Doll tells me ""live in the moment""
Don't get too far ahead - don't live in the past
I blink my eyes and the moment is over
I guess another day has passed

But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato
Always there with their free advice
They've got pearl handled pistols underneath their vests
They want me to go out drinkin with them tonight

But it's just another day
It's just another day
Watchin girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

You've got clean white sheets in the mornin'
Conversation all afternoon
Bobie Doll and Big Jim Picato, baby
And me and you

But, it's just another day
Just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day

Well it's just another day
It's just another day
Watching girls on the street
Well, that's alright with me
And it's just another day"
775,1997,OutKast,Jazzy Belle,"[Intro: André 3000]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: André 3000]
Oh, yes, I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay
House and doctor was the games we used to play
But now it’s real Jazzy Belle

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
See what if you was a playa, real playa not no flaw
Having the very best of life: lobster, steak and Perignon
Smoking an ounce of weed
And every single day was personal FreakNik
Tricking these hoes in Polo clothes, life as you conceived it
But your conception, deception, looking into your eyes
I see your weapon and it’s depressing
They're digging up in your thighs, leaving deposits
Keeping your closets open, knocking your boots and drawers
Hoping to get you sprung like bail-bonds
Steadily calling me Antwan 'cause you thinking that you my lady
Bitch, don’t play me 'cause you’re janky
I wanted to hit that ass but me and the Goodie we got danky
So thank thee, for running that Southernplayalistic game
You was the only one to blame, a nigga don’t even know yo name
It’s a shame, you cracking 'em up and fucking a nigga like 2Pac up
I’m leaving these foes to be the flowers and wake don’t get me
See, I gotta be feeding my daughter
Teach her to be that Natural Woman
'Cause you’ll be Waiting to Exhale while you other hoes be Dumb
And Dumber, yeah, you know what I’m saying

[Verse 3: André 3000]
See me and ol' girl in the black-on-black 'Lac Northstar
Windows are tinted so that no one knows who us are
Talk bad about her nigga guaranteed to snap like bra
Straps, sticking together like grandma and grandpa-pa
In this dog-eat-dog world
Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls
That we was liking in high school, now they dyking

[Verse 4: Big Boi]
Having no mercy for the disrespectful ones, some
Be hanging around the crew looking for funds, dumb
Deaf and fine, they be asking me all about mine
How she doing how she be, I know she’s sipping that wine
Behind my back they squawk like vultures
Off and On like Trends of Cultures baby
Hey he faking it like these sculptured nails
But they can go to hell and lay with Lucifer
'Cause they burning anyway, Big Boi use her and abuse her

[Outro: Khujo Goodie]

A-yo the bridge keep rockin
We comin through, bottles popin
Allure, when your album droppin?
The place is packed many faces
Of some I know and some know me from buyin cases
Cash stack shorty peepin
Is she Puerto Rican or half black?
Puff puff dib I need to live please pass that
As we zone shoot a jewel in baby girl dome
It's a crazy world let me drop you home let's go
By the way the name's Esco
The platinum Range make your man know we wet those
If he front I got the tech close
To you much respect goes
I want you had to put it on you
Allure you you gotta leave I'll call you
It's been real

[Verse 2 - Linnie]
Boy I can't understand it
See I never really felt like I do

So whats the problem
You know you like the way I act
You been around real cats
All your life since way back
You still got it cause you was turned out once
Guess you learned ain't no future with them burnt out stunts
Left the hood to get your own thing
With home team
Pushin through watchin gleam
Yeah I-ight you probably heard
That my pipe game tight
Rockin PBS stones powerful whips with egg headlights
Scent of weed gettin all in your weave
I put out the trees
And crack the moon roof
Only for you to breath
You get an extra set of keys
I tell the world while I'm out on tour
Keep your hands off my girls
Allure! (Allure)

[Bridge - Allure]
Oh, baby, can't you see
How you make me feel
Oh baby, can't you see I""m fallin for you head over heels

You've got to hold on to romance, don't let it slide
There's a special kind of magic in the air
When you find another heart that needs to share
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you
Spendin' ev'ry dime to keep you talkin' on the line that's how it was
And all those walks together out in any kind of weather
Just because, just because there's a brand-new way of looking at your life
And when you know that love'll be standing by your side
Baby, come to me, let me put my arms around you
This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me
Baby, always stay 'cause I can't go back to livin' without you
The nights can be cold
There's a chill to ev'ry evenin' when you're all alone
Don't talk anymore
'Cause you know that I'll be here to keep you warm, keep you warm

This was meant to be and I'm oh so glad I found you
Need you ev'ry day, gotta have your love around me baby, always stay

I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you had the answer
You told me to take a chance
And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer..
You told me your secret love won't let you down
Ohh allll my love baby...

[Verse 1: Da Brat]
Hey nigga ain't shit gonna ever change
Between you and your boo
Put a hold on me ever since I held you
What compelled you to be my nigga
Besides passion and love
You ran up on a real bitch with understanding and trust
Fuck the others, none of them compare to us
And under covers you my muthafucka nigga
When you stickin my stuff
You laid pipe unlike any other plumber
Took me shoppin all day and at night, you kept me cummin
Made dinner, collard greens, candied yams and steak
Taught me how to measure grams, cook rocks, and chop weights
Caught a case, cuz you're boy ran his mouth too much
And it's a disgrace how the pain felt to miss your touch
But as the days keep passin, keep it actin with stacks of letters
Hit you so you don't forget us
When you'd rather not be livin in the cella
Hella muthafuckas want your occupation
But they can keep pacin, cuz I'm gonna be waitin on my Baby...

[Chorus: T-Boz & Da Brat]
And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
Ran into your boy, had heard he'd spread the word
That you was soft, braggin he collecting your cheese
And pissing me the fuck off
The first thought of committing a felony never left
I missed the big breaths you took when we waz puffin an L
Just the little things you do with the bigger ones I
Saw better SL 500s colorful Gucci sweaters and leathers
Diamond letters girl you broke, I saved the sugar for you
Keep the business runnin, droppin off keys in Cancun
Cash rules, and you remain to be the King of my throne
Position taken, flippin calender pages till you get home
Wanna blast your boy for snatchin up my happiness
But I regret what'll happen to this dollar foundation
If I'm incarcerated
Too you can make it through, we bail on the Jealous
Who tell us the opposite of that
Forever you and Brat
I tried to take the blame, but you prefered to handle my fame
So i'm waitin with open arms to rekindle the flame...

[Chorus: T-Boz & Da Brat]
And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around
And all this love, is waiting for you
My baby... Sweet Darling...
And all this love is waiting for you
Don't worry bout a thing, nigga stay down
As long as you can hang, I'm-a be around
And all this love, is waiting for you

Yo.. yo.. check.. check..
Don't nobody wanna deal with a nigga that got it together
For real, and even think his own thoughts
Everybody wanna do what everybody else do
When the ""copycat"" is what they been taught
I'ma get in the brain of the lame
I contain pain, and I'ma give it to the rap game
The way you're doin' it, the way you're pursuin' it
You're gonna ruin the feelin', it's a goddamn shame
Are you ready for the real? Here we go now
Most on the radio can't flow now
Everyday I gotta cut the radio down
Sound like another Pac or an O-Town
We can't have a contest or a showdown
With two guys got the same kinda flow sound
Tecca Nina; I'm comin' to put the mo' down
Run up in the record label with the fo' pound
Am I too versatile? Cursed to drown in the bowels of the Earth
When I'll be first to growl, and burst out the fouls
Of the original murderous verse out the mouth
Big Tech N9ne's gonna be the one winnin' the race
That's real, I'm speakin' to everyone in the place
I can deal what ya don't like; the drum and the bass
If you can deal with a motherfuckin' gun in your face
I can't get wit' it
Record labels in the industry are sick wit' it
P.D.'s that really don't know a hit for shit
Kick the bitch - if you diss my hit, you might get pistol-whipped
Catch him in the hall - hit 'em in the jaw
Give it to the fans, they can get it all
'Cause the industry is punks! - check I'm ready to get crunk
I'm comin' to straight dump with a pump!

Like sayin' a fool can slang 'caine
A fool can gangbang but never will get hit with a gat?
You better - get your story straight
'Cause I ain't no devil for real - I'm a rebel for real
That Tech N9ne is on some other level for real
You a pebble to real niggas - songs like ""Psycho Bitch"" and ""Real Killa""
""Einstein"", ""Niggas"" after mill still-a
The idiots say black folks won't feel us
What you think we dumb?
Do we all gotta run when the heat come?
Showin' original tongue, it'll be fun
But the motherfuckers with the bums and the weak ones
Suge Knight punked the industry quick
That's because most the industry's bitch!

I come from a kingdom of humble drums and hums become rumbles
I'm the one that begun the gun tongue
Get sprung, now everyone comin' in bundles
Act like a bitch; treated like a bitch
Act like a chump; treated like a chump
When the funk jump - what ya gonna want?
Ain't gon' want nothin' - industry punk
You can run but you can't hide from the riot
So you can say that it's dope but I won't buy it
You can think Tech N9ne really won't fly
But I got a killa ear and a killa eye
Def Jam take chances; in my opin-ions
They give advances; to the niggas that's really on
Universal, Loud, LaFace - that's some of my favorites
But the ones who call the shots; most of 'em on some heinous shit
That other shit; call your mother, sis, or ya brother bitch
Not no lover licks, packin' black and fat, blubber shit

Dashin', decked in the latest fashions
Flashin', niggas spendin' tax free cash, ten G stash

Ass in abundance, run with a sick type
Click with mics get in your shit life
So better make sure your shit's tight

Dong Strongarm in the place at alarming rates
Got a fifth and that's all it takes

Yeah this is how we get down with no question
Run up in a chicken's midsection, boom I rock on

Menage-a-trois, killin' your whole crew
With at least sixteen bars like MC's supposed to
A real MC, take you, to School like D
I'm Kool like G, in Rap, I use the mic, to rule like a pharoah
Dipped in my Nike apparel, (hah!) you know we get down
Bad to the bone like marrow chicks
Crack your boom, Tray gets played from the plat the greatest tune
Philly's in here, been here, lyrics they win here
Why did you go there?  I swear
RNF tears the things like that
We breakin' your team up like a salary cap, and it don't stop
Until I get the cream like Shaq

When I ride loops like a stretch Benz, heads get laced
D-Dot, keep the chrome cocked, just in case
Tracey Lee rocks son I'm chosen
Whenever we got this party scene live it's frozen
Whoaaa, time to close in on those who be dozen
Not tryin to hear it, without wine and spirit
Shows continue to blow the venue
With flows that's sicker than influ-enza
Roll with a squad that injures pretenders
I'm pullin' your card, so surrender
Bombard your agenda, at last RNF stash
With more pitch slaughterin', so we be the new world order in

[Chorus: Tracey Lee and crew]
And everywhere that my crew go
And every hoe that my crew know
And every show that my crew blow
You know we get down, you know we get down

If I could get a dollar, for everytime you look at me sideways
I'll pay the Westside on Friday's to build y'all playa haters y'all own highways
Don't trip on me partner, no uh-uh
I'm havin' visions of Bloody Mary with AIDS tryin' to give me some nana
You can't dictate mines, what I look like to you baby?
Besides the feelin' is fine
All natural like oat bran, engineered like no other
Fly for life, still as a mannequin when it comes to my mother
Capricorn baby and I'm stubborn just like you
So why don't you do me a favor and tell that lie to that fool
Don't get me twisted baby, I love you too
But when that rent and that car note come what love gon' do?
Baby, my money's on the clock, right around the block
You see me stack big knot, my music's all I got
So I'mma stay ready so I don't gotta get ready
Cause I rose like King Tut and resurrect it like Amadeus

If you stay ready

Now, orange juice and Austy got me feelin' lodi dodi
Flippin' through my phone book tryin' to find me a hottie
I can't wait to let ya lies and just relax with
That ain't jockin' me cause of who I stacks with
Ain't too many I'm comin' across qualifyin'
But I be that player from the P that's just gon' keep on tryin'
I go from A to Y, cause I don't know no Z's
To the Brougham, blow the brains and enjoy the breeze
These hunnies got me wonderin' if I'll ever find one
That'll get me to that place where I wouldn't mind one
Out in traffic I see many lookin' choosable
It never fails though, I always end up usin' those
For whatever I'm needin' at that point in time
A get-away, a good one or another rhyme
I'm tired of the S.O.S. but it's real
Long as I feel 'em like I do I guess I'm just gon' deal

And God bless my backbones, my homeboys like Black Tone

Bringin' it through for the true everytime I speak
Sprinkles the rest like '40, but they still comin' weaker
I'mma keep it simple so the tricks can comprehend
You can never be me, only see me with a end

Well if they ain't ripe yet, they can stay on the tree
Cause I'm your friendly neighborhood playa partner Suga Free
Liable to haul off and spit these P's that'll break you to your knees
She'll lie, steal and kill for real for me, Hamm please

[Playa Hamm]
Now what they thought baby? We ain't comin' to raw
If she broke she gon' get a job, or break the law
They say God blessed the child, God is on it so true
We ain't get it like we got it dependin' on you

[Suga Free]
Now I can show ya better than I can tell ya, so swell
No, put your clothes back on baby
I'm into breakin' hearts, promises and fingernails
There was no I's... And I put that on the Holy Ghost and four more God's
You broke my heart and I let you succeed
Cause to a playa that's a organ that you really don't need
Low and behold, what good is havin' a heart if it can break and be re-broke?
So if you stay ready what you gon' have to get ready for?

If you stay ready

You ain't got to get ready

If you stay ready

I grew up a fucking screwup
Got introduced to the game
Got a ounce and fucking blew up

Chopping rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying
Ta turn into the black Frank White

We had to grow dreads
To change our description
Two cops on the milk box missing

Show they toes
You know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets
A chest full of Teflon

Run from the police, picture that
Nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and
Catch a asthma attack

That's why I bust back
It don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock
And I'm Swayze

Summer break, my escape
Sold the Glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make
Motherfucker

From the five-oh
Ducking and dodging in my survival
The Benzo and I let off with my nine

I'm moving swifter
Than the next nigga
No time for sex
'Cause in my mind
All I wonder is who's next

Nigga, my homey slipped
And now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen
Now he's doin' triple life

Tell me is it me or my upbringing
I split that dove shit
Nigga motherfuck singing

I hope you got your
Timberlands on tight
'Cause I ain't givin' up
I'd rather duck these
Motherfuckers all night

I'm running through
The projects, beyotch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'd and trigger happy
On the sneotch

Don't say you never heard of me
Till they murder me, I'm a legend
Do Thug Niggas go to heaven

Start up a fight

Why did you clean the floor?
Why did you plaster over the hole I punched in the door?
This is where we used to live

Why did you keep the mousetrap?
Why did you keep the dish rack?
These things used to be mine
I guess they still are, I want them back

Broke into the old apartment
Forty-two steps from the street
Crooked landing, crooked landlord
Narrow laneway filled with crooks
This is where we used to live

Why did they pave the lawn?
Why did they change the locks?
Why did I have to break in, I only came here to talk
This is where we used to live

How is the neighbour downstairs?
How is her temper this year?
I turned up your TV and stomped on the floor just for fun
I know we don't live here anymore
We bought an old house on the Danforth
She loves me and her body keeps me warm
And I'm happy here
This is where we used to live

Broke into the old apartment
Tore the phone out of the wall
Only memories, fading memories
Blending into dull tableaux

I want them back"

And she says that life's a waste
It doesn't have to be that way

Dad threw away her mom
Her mom gave up his name
Crucified by their words
Nailed by shame

She stares into the sun
Self-inflicted pain
She sees that they're blind
Why does she take all the blame

The rhyme has changed compulsion rules
Mary's little lambs are now raised by wolves
A voyeur with wings flashes a cure
She knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure

It's alright it's ok
Welcome to this life
Killin' time
Just watchin' the grass grow

It's alright it's ok
Welcome to this life
Don't worry sweet baby
Cuz it's over before you know

Persecuted she's not normal
I envy her strange ways
Seven deadly sins
Seize the hour seize the day

Her ideas need expression
Her wounds never bleed
Her beauty lives in my eyes
Too bad she can't see

She doesn't try I watch her spirits die
But giving up the ghost would feel so good
A voyeur with wings flashes a cure
She knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure

It's alright it's ok
Welcome to this life
Killin' time
Just watchin' the grass grow

It's alright it's ok
Welcome to this life
Don't worry sweet baby
Cuz it's over

Crumbling Camelot idle teardrops
Cloudy diamonds freebase funhouse
Expecting to fly but she's just standing still
Every time she gets it up she just can't close the deal

So she gives herself another way out
Walks her dog for the 50th time and
Files her nails till they bleed and she cries now
She doesn't have to try

It's alright, it's okay, it's alright"

I dedicate this to my man 2Pac
Rest in peace boy
You know it's all love

[Verse 1]
Who holds jurisdiction over my twisted thoughts?
And am I to blame for what's happened off in this game?
I'm do or die about my scratch but I know
This dope game 4 me just ain't the way to go
But I'm still there grinin' and winnin' just like the next foldin' paper
Thinkin' of ways to load another caper
It's a cold twist to know that I can slang all night
And slang all day but never have the courage to pray
Believe I know better but somehow I feel I'm lost
At the crossroads but am I scared to move across
Could it be what I'm drinkin'? It got me thinkin' like I'm thinkin'
""Lord I need help but I can't help myself""
Awaken to the sound of sirens, niggas dyin'
Kids in the street wit no food to eat
Prostitutes gettin' money in they only profession
But Lord I only got one question

Do G's go to Heaven? Cause I don't wanna die

[Richie Rich]
And if I took a life or perhaps sold some dope
Would you discriminate upon my entry to the gate?
I need to know my fate 'cuz now my life ain't straight
But just look it the place where I live is oh so crooked
I didn't shoot that man but I watched him die
And saw the pain and the struggle in his eye and didn't cry
So when I start to hear the thunder
Are you takin' me under or is my sin just as bad as the gunner?

[Hook]

[Richie Rich]
[bridge]
For every time I walked by, and every time I got high
For every man I watched die
Lord I need to know do gs get to go?
For all the women that I ran through
And those that I did and didn't plan to
For every scam I ran my hands through
Lord I need to do gs get to go?

And if they get to go, when its time to meet my maker
Will he understand that I am only a man
Flesh and bone born to live and die in the zone
And gets loney trying to make it on ya own
And when my baby crys my intentions are to feed
And fufill tha needs of my one and only seed
And if I rob and steal let it read in my will
""Payback from tha ones that who fell victims to my guns""
On tha run but knowin I can't hide
Why do I feel tha way I feel inside?
Its like my soul is leavin me
Are you decieving me ? I hear voices, sayin believe in me
Is it you? I hear theres a man named god
That can fix it, when its twisted
I'm not sayin I'm all that bad but I can use a lil help
Cause at times I can't help myself

I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life, you gotta love it
Jiggy-Jigga looking gully in the joint
If y'all niggas ain't talking 'bout large money, what's the point?

Putting myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm living, the ill streets' blues got you hunger pang-in'
Nothing to gain and a whole lot to lose, you still singing, fool
I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers can't really know I'm loving it, you feeling it?

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye

I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
What, y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay hot?
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zoning: me and the chick on the island and then we're boning
I free my mind sometimes I hear myself moaning
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone, man
It got me going, shit

[Chorus: Mecca]
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët
Feeling it, feel the Lex' pushing up on the set
I'm feeling it, feel the high that you get from the lye
Feeling it, if you feel it raise your L in the sky
I'm feeling it, fill the glass to the top with Moët

I was believer when you told me that you loved me
And then you called me someone else's name
Yeah!

There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these

You ain't that good

But you like the way I hold the microphone
Sometimes I'm good, but when I'm bad
I'm even better
Don't give me no lip
I've got enough of my own

[Chorus 2]
There ain't gonna be no more begging you please
You know what I want
And it ain't one of these
You're bad to the bone

[Spoken Prelude: Brandy & Monica]
- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
- Well, I just wanna let you know that he's mine

It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

[Verse 1: Brandy & Monica]
I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy (& Monica)]
You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)

Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)

He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

[Bridge: Monica & Brandy]
I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)

[Chorus: Brandy, (Brandy & Monica)]
You need to give it up (Give it on up)

Sexy thighs

And round and round tonight

Wipe our feet off on a Oriental Rug

Do what you want to this thug

Adia, I do believe I failed you
Adia, I know I've let you down
Don't you know I tried so hard
To love you in my way?
It's easy
Let it go

[Verse 2]
Adia, I'm empty since you left me
Trying to find a way to carry on
I search myself and everyone
To see where we went wrong

[Verse 3]
There's no one left to finger
There's no one here to blame
There's no one left to talk to, honey
And there ain't no one to buy our innocence

[Chorus]
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

[Verse 4]
Adia, I thought that we could make it
I know I can't change the way you feel
I leave you with your misery
Your friend who won't betray

[Verse 5]
I pull you from your tower
I take away your pain
I show you all the beauty you possess
If you'd only let yourself believe

[Chorus]
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?
Cause we are born innocent
Believe me, Adia
We are still innocent
It's easy, we all falter
Does it matter?

You only see what your eyes want to see
How can life be what you want it to be?
You're frozen
When your heart's not open

You're so consumed with how much you get
You waste your time with hate and regret
You're broken
When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

Now there's no point in placing the blame
And you should know I suffer the same
If I lose you
My heart will be broken

Love is a bird, she needs to fly
Let all the hurt inside of you die

When your heart's not open

Mmmmmm, if I could melt your heart
Mmmmmm, we'd never be apart
Mmmmmm, give yourself to me
Mmmmmm, you hold the key

All up in my eye, you got a Prada
Bag with a lot-a, stuff in it
Give it to your friend let's spin, everybody lookin' at me
Glancin' the kid, wishing they was dancin' a jig
Here with this handsome kid, ciga-cigar
Right from Cuba-Cuba, I just bite it
It's for the look, I don't light it
Illway the an-may on the ance-day oor-flay
Give it up jiggy make it feel like foreplay

What?
You want to ball with the kid?
Watch your step you might fall
Trying to do what I did
Mama mama mama come closer
In the middle of the club with the rub-a-dub, uh
No love for the haters, the haters
Mad cause I got floor seats at the Lakers
See me on the fifty yard line with the Raiders
Met Ali he told me I'm the greatest
I got the fever for the flavor of a crowd-pleaser
DJ play another from the prince of this
Your highness, only mad chicks ride in my whips
South to the West to the East to the North
Bought my hits and watch them go off a go off
Ah, yes-yes y'all
Ya don't stop in the winter or the (Summertime)

Eight-fifty I.S. if you need a lift
Who's the kid in the drop? Who else Will Smith
Living that life some consider a myth
Rock from South Street to one-two-fifth
Women used to tease me, give it to me now nice and easy
Since I moved up like George and Weezie
C.R.E.A.M. to the maximum I be asking 'em
Would you like to bounce with the brother that's platinum?
Never see Will attacking 'em
Rather play ball with Shaq and 'em, flatten 'em
Psych, kidding
Thought I took a spill, but I didn't
Trust the lady of my life she hitting
Hit her with a drop top with the ribbon
Crib for my mom on the outskirts of Philly
You trying to flex on me?
Don't be silly

Is it all it should be
When the water gets rough
Will you still swim with me?
So afraid to come close

Heard about my past, things I used to do
The games I used to play, the girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind, think I'm doin' wrong
Can I say what is real? You are the only one
When I'm not around, do you think of me?
Or what the jealous ones are claimin' me to be
You should know by now, that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through

You should know, baby, you're my angel
Nothing's gonna make you fall from Heaven
Girl, I just want to love you, love you

Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy

Girl, lets talk about what your friends told you
That I'm a selfish man, want my cake and eat it to
Maybe in my past but you changed me now
Now that I've learned to love, it's you that showed me how
Your love so real I'd be a fool to play
Play around on you, I want to stay with you
You should know by now that it's gonna take
A lot of trust from you for us to make it through

Look at the sky
Tell me what do you see
Just close your eyes
And describe it to me
The heavens are sparkling
With starlight tonight
That's what I see through your eyes
I see the heavens
Each time that you smile
I hear your heartbeat
Just go on for miles
And suddenly I know
My life is worth while
That's what I see through your eyes

[Chorus]
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

[Verse 2]
I look at myself
And instead I see us
Whoever I am now
It feels like enough
And I see a girl
Who is learning to trust
That's who I see through your eyes

[Chorus]
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes

[Bridge]
And there are some things we don't know
Sometimes a heart just needs to go
And there is so much
I'll remember
Underneath the open sky with you forever

[Chorus]
Here in the night
I see the sun
Here in the dark
Our two hearts are one
It's out of our hands
We can't stop
What we have begun
And love just took me by surprise
Looking through your eyes"

So feel the wrath of this sista, it's like you fightin 10 niggas
Forget the baby boys, it's the biggest mamma Mia
The Unlady Like diva, lyrical man eater, believe her
Or see her, and get that ass embarrassed
If you're a decision maker, guaranteed you'll get carried away
So stay in yo' place, when ya hear mamma speakin

Ayo, my whole clique 'bout it, 'bout it
We take yours while you pout about it
Truck, step out, the whores wanna crowd around it
You could see me on Optimum TV
Go in your bathroom turn the light out
Scream, ""Bloody Mary, 1, 2, 3""
Sheek ain't your usual friend
But I could set you up like Keyser and walk straight at the end
I'm done with ice and charms
I'm tryna ice my whole casket when I'm gone
Pull up with class on the don, once I meet 'em I greet 'em
Kiss his feet for freedom, tell em' thank you Lord
'Cause on Earth I was gettin' bored
Now resurrect me back to this cat called Sheek
So I can make this album and get back the cats that's weak
Two-thirty, six two
Me budge for you? That's like a cat vers' a pitbull

And plan for the future, 'cause you figure you gon' be older
Way longer than you gon' be younger (What's the key to life?)

Two personalities, check the posture
Smoke out the mouth clear out the nostrils
Think of death, then life seem scary
I'm passin' graveyards seein' people Hail Mary
I ain't chillin' 'til I'm out parachutin'
Race my man in mountain climbin' for about ten diamonds
Twenty five thousand a piece, fuck streets
Tryin' to own the island, forget about wildin'
Try ridin' in the car that be glidin'
If I showed you where I lived, you would think I was hidin'
Sling dick to chicks that don't speak English
Wake up in Trinidad like, ""Fuck it, I'm rich""
Come back, private jet, live on set
If you can shit gold, then I can spit baguettes (What's the key to life?)

You scared to blow one, get robbed with your own gun
If I don't respect you I'ma check you
And if I don't kiss you I'ma peck you
Right before I wet you I sneeze on tracks and bless you
I'm special and if you like workin' out then I'm gon' stretch you
Hustlin' is dead, but we still get red
Turn the spots into bakeries to get back bread
And y'all said my money's spent, but it's in the Bent'

And my story, self-explanatory
That I'm the hottest thing on the street

I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
""I want to get out of this""
I wonder is there anything
I'm going to miss

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how it's going to be
When you don't know me
How's it going to be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it going to be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the
Doorway we spent time in, swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
'Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?"
828,1998,Gloria Estefan,Heaven's What I Feel,"Love sometimes can be like destiny
There's no way to say forever
It may not realize your dreams
And love sometimes is like the blowing wind
It can take us to wherever
Sending us on silent wings

But I have broken all the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do to stop this love for you

I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else and someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real: Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you

This feeling is forever, it is forever
You make me feel like Heaven, I feel like Heaven
My love is true when I'm with you

How could I have known that in your eyes
I would find the deepest answers to the questions of my heart
And how could I have known that by your side
Was the light to fill the darkness in the shadows of my life

But I have broken all the rules of love
I never dreamed that I could come this far
And now I'm lost in my emotions
You're becoming my devotion
There's nothing I can do to stop this love for you

I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else and someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real: Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you

This feeling is forever
You make me feel like heaven
My love is true when I'm with you

This feeling is forever, it is forever
You make me feel like Heaven, I feel like Heaven
My love is true when I'm with you

Heaven, Heaven
Is what I feel when we're together
Heaven, Heaven
Just look in my eyes and you'll see it's the truth

And I was not supposed to fall in love with you
I have someone else and someone else is loving you
And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real: Heaven's what I feel

And I was not supposed to let this love get through
So let me say for real: Heaven's what I feel when I'm with you"

[Verse 1]
She had two babies, one was six months, one was three
In the war of '44
Every telephone ring, every heartbeat stinging
When she thought it was God calling her
Oh, would her son grow to know his father?

[Chorus]
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be sorry

He showed up all wet on the rainy front step
Wearing shrapnel in his skin
And the war he saw lives inside him still
It's so hard to be gentle and warm
The years pass by and now he has granddaughters

[Chorus]
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
I want to know right now what will it be
I don't want to wait for our lives to be over
Will it be yes or will it be

[Verse 3]
Ohhh, so look at me from across the room
You're wearing your anguish again
Believe me I know the feeling
It sucks you into the jaws of anger
Ohhh, so breathe a little more deeply
All we have is this very moment
And I don't want to do what his father
And his father, and his father did
I want to be here now

So open up your morning light
And say a little prayer for I
You know that if we are to stay alive
Then see the peace in every eye

I don't want to wait for our lives to be over

Baby, hello
Oh no, goodbye

Shy but sexy at the same time
Always on my mind was a little bump and grind

Good lesson taught by my big homey E-Z
I got to compliment you on how you please me
Touch me, but don't tease me
Now put it in nice and easy

And rub my body down I'm feeling wheezy
And cuddle up to me
Cuz now I'm getting sleepy
But I'mma be dedicated
To this relation
So stay away from all them cowboys
So we can not be playa hated

Cuz if you wit me boo, then keep it real
And if I catch you sleepin' around

[Peter Gunz]
New York to the heart, but got love for all
Lie and die in the fire, where I learned to ball
Uptown is the place where I lay my dome
On the streets of the Bronx where my family roam
Ho damn it, we home, Peter got a nine millimeter
Playa haters can feel the flame from my heater
I never really liked to play a fool like that
But I love to succeed and see foes fall flat
Splat, like deja vu
And I got another clip that'll daze y'all crew
I sip Cristal, Dom P, Mo' with pist-al
Just cause I'm pissy, don't mean you should misdoubt
Keep em near da fifties and, hundreds all arranged
Anything less than that, you keep the change
Not filthy rich, but bitch I'm barely broke
Blessed with flows that keep you hooked like dope
Friends call me Gunz, sons call me trife
Cause I'm quick to slide off and slide this dick up in your wife
And that's life, you should learn how to treat her
I guarantee Peter, knows how to eat her
And beat her, niggas in the Bronx call me Lex
Cause I push a Lex, and I rock a Rolex
And I lounge on Lex, and I love sex
And I wave techs on sets that be tryin to flex
Like Dex, nigga God rest your soul
But when you're playin cards for Gunz, it ain't no time to fold

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same
Brooklyn niggas get crazy loot
That's because when it's beef they ain't scared to shoot
Harlem niggas know how to play
Mack the 600, getting crazy pay
Niggas outta Queens got shit on lock
Strapped with the Glock, running up in your spot

[Hook: Lord Tariq (Peter Gunz)]
But if it wasn't for the Bronx
This rap shit probably never would be going on
So tell me where you from

We gets down baby, up for the crown baby)

So tell me where you from

[Lord Tariq]
Yo the RM-80, is parked in the lot
Right next to the Mercedes, keep the heat cocked
For these blocks that are shady, you're crazy if you walk around
Thinking shit's gravy; stop me? Maybe
I'm livin life lawless, makin big investments
On them 8-class flawless, and hoes call us
I'm comfortable like Recaro, two quarters of my life
Walkin roads type narrow, deep thoughts which I abide by
Puffin high, got my mind's eye, points sharper
Than an arrow gettin high, keep your eye on the sparrow
Riches like the pharaoh, bought a new five
With the snitches for these hoes, trunk full of ammo
Keep my toast closer than most niggas keep they own shadow
And I strap for my foes like a saddle
I rock stones, other niggas rock gravel
Talk shit? Whatever have you, I'm from Soundview
Bronx most wanted, front get confronted
Playa, we rollin deep in the one point five hundreds
Like Big I., red eyed, mad blunted
You step outside and get blooded have your whole block flooded
With the Bronx it's a warnin, stormin guns out
From dusk 'til dawn and it's on, no doubt
Keep a eye on yo' bitch when I'm roamin about
And put a eye on yo' lip nigga, watch yo' mouth
I'm from the Bronx, wipe yo' feet when you step in my house
Cause you's a small-time nigga, bout a half an ounce now

[Pre-Hook: Peter Gunz]
New York niggas got crazy game
But outta town niggas is all the same

She's sittin' back in the room, the lights are off, she's cryin', and then my voice comes in, POW!, in the middle of the night, and this is what I told her for you

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why
See, you must understand, I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone 'til November
Said I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
Yo, tell my girl, yo, I'll be gone 'til November
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November

I see you cryin', but girl, I can't stay
I'll be gone 'til November, I'll be gone 'til November
And give a kiss to my mother

[Verse 1]
When I come back, there'll be no need to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out blocks
Tell my brother, ""Go to school in September""
So he won't mess up in summer school in the summer
Tell my cousin, Jerry, wear his condom
If you don't wear condom, you'll see a red lump
Woh oh oh oh
You sucker MC's, you got no flow
I heard your style, you're s-o s-o

I had to flip nuttin' and turn it into somethin'
Hip-hop turns to the future rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason, then I'll have a reason to hunt you down
It's only right, it's rappin' season
Yeah, you with the loud voice, posin' like you're top choice
Your voice, I'll make a hearse out of your Rolls Royce
Besides, I got my girl to remember
And I'll commit it that I'll be back in November

[Chorus]
Every time I make a run
Girl, you turn around and cry

Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 1: Usher]
Before anything began between us
You were like my best friend
The one I used to run and talk to when me and my girl was having problems
You used to say it would be okay
Suggest little nice things I should do
And when I'd go home at night and lay my head down
All I seemed to think about was you
And how...

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Verse 2: Usher]
Now, what's bad is you're the one that hooked us up
Knowing it should've been you
What's sad is I love her, but I'm falling for you
What should I do?
Should I, tell my baby bye-bye?
Should I, do exactly what I feel inside?
'Cause I, I don't wanna go, don't need to stay
But I really need to get it together

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me

[Bridge: Usher]
At this point, the situation's out of control
I never meant to hurt her, but I gotta let her go
And she may not understand it while all of this is going on
I tried, I tried to fight it, but the feeling's just too strong
You make, make, make me

[Interlude: Usher & Jermaine Dupri]
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
You make me wanna...
Come along with
You're making me, you're making me

[Chorus: Usher]
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do
Think about a ring and all the things that come along with
You make me, you make me
You make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this is what you do

All I want is for you to use your imagination (come on)
That's all
Come on (come on)

[Hook: Tamia]
What makes us do
The things we do
That keeps me lovin' you (imagination)
And when you're in need
And got nobody
Imagination sets you free, free

[Verse 1: Tamia]
Everything you want is real close when you close your eyes
And the things you think about the most
They come to life (come to life)
When your relationship is heading for the rocks
Gotta use your imagination to get you back on top

[Hook: Tamia]

[Verse 2: Tamia]
It's the place you look when you want to have some fun
When you see it, say it, before it's done, uh huh
Imagine you and me, and how it would feel
Exploring new ideas and what's gon' keep this lovin' real
When you get lonely (lonely)
It'll make you get to a phone and tell me how much you want me
And when you have a bad day
A little bit of imagination goes a long way

[Verse 3: Jermaine Dupri]
Oh, true buff playa, that's the chi-chi
Wanna get up out the store, you'll need to see me
Now I got you wondering, look behind the slouch
If you get too close when you get turned out
No doubt, it won't be the same if I hit it
Cuz you always gon' want it the way I did it
I'mma keep you fresh, make sure you stay kiddy
See once I got it, can't nobody else get it
From the bottom to the top
'Till you say stop
You and me, wit the freak cuz I'mma great drop
I'll kiss everything, I don't miss a spot
Stuff you ain't never seen from the man you got
I ain't hatin', my imagination's just more advanced
So when you wanna dance, I'mma make you dance
Tamia I see ya, I'm still waiting
You make me wanna, leave that to your imagination

	You tease me all the time but I had enough
	Maybe I should ask your girlfriends why
	Why you are so afraid to fall in love

Girl I won't get next to you
You know I don't like sweatin' you
But something 'bout the way you make me feel
You got me in this fantasy
And all my friends keep tellin' me
Shorty's kinda hot, so what's the deal?

2 - 	Cuz we been spendin', rollin', livin', showin'
	We got some time for play
	But you've been player hatin', waitin'
	For this rhyme to pass away

Repeat 1

You only get the best with me
I wanna give you everything
And anything you ask of me I will
And I don't want to front on you
So tell me what you wanna do
And if I'm not the one
Just keep it real

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

Now first of all baby, what's my name?
Spell it backwards you read game
I'm known for splittin'  wigs  and readin' brains
And when I say splittin' wigs and readin' brains
I mean breakin' it down conversation-wise
Let me explain

I'm in your corner, girl be on my team
Together we could fulfill each other's life dream
We both Gemini so we got 2 sides
Our zodiac sign is the perfect sign
Cuz she replied, ""All Gemini's lie""
I guess this is what it feels like when doves cry
Your attitude is deep cover
Won't give me the number
Cold play me out like a foul, a bleep or a blunder
It's like a burnin' in the chest, a cardiac arrest
You look like you havin' fun puttin' me thru stress
So in between time and in the meantime
You do your thing and I do mine
But don't play wit my mind

Shorty, shorty
Won't you please get naughty with me
And if you really wanna
I can be your fantasy
You are so afraid, oh baby

""You know how that go, stop doing that
You're violatin', straight up and down""

Uh, Count Bass, uh, yeah, check it
Spongebath 9-9-9, Egon

We just did like Jimmy Castor
Here's the brother who causes mad disastors
I make you see things where they supposed to go
For instance, I think it should be Fat Pun and Big Joe
Where were you when G Rap rocked ""Stilleto?""
If you're over 19 you should know
But I bet you never ever heard of MC Marshon
Cause you're too busy banging all that garbage in your car
What? I declare I'm the best with vigor
But you still figure you can test the drums, bass, and keys (nigga)
You think you Guru cause your rep is growing bigger
But you can say I'm sort of the boss cause I'm a skinny black
Beat machine, Doctor Rhythm, giving quadruple bypasses
To my sampler in a 4/4 meter
And while you rhyming about your homes in the Hamptons
We down here, keeping it live like Peter Frampton
Yeah Matt's mansion like Knott's Landing
I've been on four labels but I'm still standing
And there was never a doubt that when I landed
In 1991 I would turn the whole region out

Chorus x4

I got the rhythm like Jarobi, all y'all know me
It's the brother taking notes from Paul C's legacy
Here in Tenessee, I'm 25 years old, I'm a let the truth be told
And who am I? A Beenie Man, and you? A Beanie Baby
Why? Cause you got a child and a lady, but you can't feed 'em
But when they act up, you the first one to beat 'em, what?
I hate no one but I love only a few
Bobby McFerrin, Mervin Warren, and Mr. Say Who
Scientific to be specific
Cause him and Vic taught me how to make beats in 360 minutes
Y'all finished, we taking spinach
Cause I'm an A-sharp-seventh and youse an F-flat-diminished
I own a Grand Am, and you lease a Lex
But if you so damn rich then why you staying at your mom's rest?

Am I getting through to you?
Hello, is it late there?
Is there laughter on the line?

Are you sure you're there alone
'Cause I'm trying to explain?
Something's wrong
You just don't sound the same

Why don't you?
Why don't you go outside?
Go outside

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long

If your lips feel lonely and thirsty
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn
Keep in mind

We're under the same sky
And the night's
As empty for me as for you
If you feel
You can't wait till morning
Kiss the rain, kiss the rain, kiss the rain

Hello, do you miss me?
I hear you say you do
But not the way I'm missing you

What's new? How's the weather?
Is it stormy where you are?
You sound so close but it feels like you're so far
Oh, would it mean anything

If you knew
What I'm left imagining
In my mind, my mind
Would you go? Would you go?

Kiss the rain

As you fall over me
Think of me, think of me
Think of me, only me

Kiss the rain
Whenever you need me
Kiss the rain
Whenever I'm gone too long

If your lips
Feel hungry and tempted
Kiss the rain
And wait for the dawn

Keep in mind
We're under the same sky
And the nights
As empty for me as for you

If you feel
You can't wait till morning

Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain

Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain
Kiss the rain

Hello, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?"

Yo, Canibus, man, what's up, man?
I caught you on that cut with Wyclef
Man, you were booming
But I caught these foul slouch-ass niggas, you know I mean?
Talking foul about you the other night
On the corner of the boulevard, man, I wasn't with that
But I ain't know you well enough to defend you though, right?
But you seem like you got true game
But peep game, man, they've been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times
Did right, you know what I mean?
But they can't hurt us, man, we gonna do it
Get up in this ring, man, put on these gloves
Let me show how to handle yourself, man
You don't got nobody out there with you
I gots to show you, man, get up in there, move that head, man
Come on to me, man, but when you come, man
You gotta come for blood, man
Come up to me, man, come on, bust that nigga whole
Man, niggas talking that shit about you
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's for lunch, breakfast
Hey, man, they been playing me all my life, man
You know I won the title a couple of times, did right?
No, but they can't hurt us, man
We gonna do it, get up in this ring man, put on these gloves
Let me show you how to handle yourself, man

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Yo, I'ma let the world know the truth, you don't want me to shine
You studied my rhyme, then you laid your vocals after mine
That's a bitch move, somethin' that a homo rapper would do
So when you say that you platinum, you only droppin' clues
I studied your background, read the book that you wrote
Researched your footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like a drug-free role model, you disgust me
I know bitches that seen you smoke weed recently
You walk around showin' off your body 'cause it sells
Plus to avoid the fact that you ain't got skills
Mad at me 'cause I kick that shit real niggas feel
While 99% of your fans wear high heels
From Ice-T to Kool Moe Dee to Jay Z
Now you want to fuck with me? You must be crazy
You drippin' with wack juice and you can't get it off
You better be prepared to finish what you start, nigga

[Interlude: Mike Tyson]
Yo Canibus, man, you gotta hit harder than that man
You don't want no bitch-ass niggas hanging out with me, man
We're warriors man, when we go into battle
We come out or don't come out at all

[Verse 2: Canibus]
You better give me the respect that I deserve or I'ma take it by force
Blast you with a .45 Colt, make you somersault
Shock you with a couple hundred thousand volt thunderbolts
Before you wanted a war, now you wanna talk?
It's about who strikes the hardest, not who strikes first
That's why I laugh when I hear that wack-ass verse
That shit was the worst rhyme I ever heard in my life
'Cause the greatest rapper of all time died on March 9th
God bless his soul; rest in peace, kid
It's because of him now at least I know what beef is
It's not what I would call this, see this is somethin' different
A faggot nigga tryna make a livin' off of dissin'
Somebody that he gotta know is better than him
But he feelin' himself 'cause he got more cheddar than him
Well, let me tell you somethin', you might got more cash than me
But you ain't got the skills to eat a nigga's ass like me
And if you really want to show off, we can get it on
Live in front of the cameras on your own sitcom
I'll let you kick a verse—fuck it, I'll let you kick 'em all
I'll even wait for the studio audience to applaud
Now watch me rip the tat from your arm
Kick you in the groin, stick you for your Vanguard award
In front of your mom, your first, second and third born
Make your wife get on the horn, call Minister Farrakhan
So he could persuade me to squash it
I say ""Naw, he started it, he forgot what a hardcore artist is.""
A hardcore artist is a dangerous man
Such as myself, trained to run twenty miles in soft sand
On or off land, programmed to kick hundreds of bars offhand
From a lost and forgotten land
You done did it, man, you done spitted some wack shit
And probably thought that because it's been a minute I'll forget it?
Fuck that! 'Cause like Common and Cube, I See the Bitch in Yoo
And I'ma make the world see it too, motherfucker

[Interlude: Referee]
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new lyrical weight champion
By second round knock out
3 minutes and 40 seconds, Can-i-bus

[Outro: Mike Tyson]
Yo, Canibus man, you moving like Mike Tyson Jr
Man, you in-and-out, and you're agile with your flow, man
But dig right, you got to eat, man
That's your name Canibus
Your whole agenda is to eat these niggas, man
They have no business to be in the same stage with you
Holding the mic with you, but dig right
Hey, Mike Tyson here speaking
With the Canibus man over here
Yo, Canibus, your main objective out here
Is to do nothing but eat, eat, eat, eat MC's
For lunch, breakfast, dinner; that's your agenda, baby
Your agenda to consume them
Their whole existence, they can't exist in your presence
The Canibus is here to rule forever, Mike Tyson, on the def"

854,1998,Aretha Franklin,A Rose Is Still A Rose,"[Intro]
Listen, dear
I realise that you've been hurt, deep
Because I've been there
But regardless to who, what, why, when and where
We're all precious in his sight
And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose

Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

[Verse 1]
There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Verse 2]
Now believe me when I tell you that I've been hurt myself
When he tells you that he loves you, it's you, nobody else
And now you're so tough, tryin' to wear tight clothes and things
Tossin' and flossin', tryin' to fill the void heartbreak brings
Oh, oh, yeah
When she gets nearer
She's cryin', you can't hear her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Chorus]
See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Bridge]
Let your life be in the sunshine
Not the darkness of your sorrow
You may see you're lost today
But new love will come tomorrow
Don't believe that life is over
Just because your man is gone
Girl, love yourself enough to know
That without him, your life goes on
Without him, your life goes on
And without him, your life goes on

[Chorus]
'Cause a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Baby girl, you hold the power (what I am is what I am)

[Chorus]
See, a rose is still a rose
Baby girl, you're still a flower
He can't leave you and then take you
Make you and then break you
Darlin', you hold the power (what I am is what I am)"

856,1998,2Pac Featuring Eric Williams,Do For Love,"[Intro: 2Pac]
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

[Chorus: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

[Outro: Eric Williams]
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah
Do for love"
857,1998,Elton John,Recover Your Soul,"[Verse 1]
Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on? It's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning

[Chorus]
Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go
And hey now let's recover your soul

[Verse 2]
Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Hey now let's recover
Hey now let's recover your soul
And hey now let's recover your soul"

859,1998,Loreena McKennitt,The Mummers' Dance,"[Verse 1]
When in the springtime of the year
When the trees are crowned with leaves
When the ash and oak and the birch and yew
Are dressed in ribbons fair

When owls call the breathless moon
In the blue veil of the night
The shadows of the trees appear
Amidst the lantern light

[Chorus]
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

[Verse 2]
Who will go down to those shady groves
And summon the shadows there
And tie a ribbon on those sheltering arms
In the springtime of the year

The songs of birds seem to fill the wood
That when the fiddler plays
All their voices can be heard
Long past their woodland days

[Chorus]
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

[Verse 3]
And so they linked their hands and danced
Round in circles and in rows
And so the journey of the night descends
When all the shades are gone

A garland gay we bring you here
And at your door we stand
It is a sprout well budded out
The work of our Lord's hand

[Chorus]
We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay

We've been rambling all the night
And some time of this day
Now returning back again
We bring a garland gay"

Well, it's been a long time, glad to see your face
I knew we'd meet again, another time, another place
Can't believe it's been so many years
You'd better grab a chair and a couple of beers
Looking good in your three-piece suit
You know, I always knew you'd take the business route
You were always the one to follow the light
And you look like you're doing alright, yeah

[Verse 2]
Been singing for my rent and singing for my supper
I'm above the below and below the upper
I'm stuck in the middle where money gets tight
But I guess I'm doing alright

I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright

[Verse 3]
Well, we had a lot of dreams when we were younger
They thought we were crazy, but we had the hunger
We kept a lot of friends, skipped a lot of class
Been on top of the world and knocked on our
We lost touch, we lost in love
We lost our minds when things got tough
But beating time is a losing fight
And I guess I'm doing alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
I got a good old friend here with me tonight
And I guess I'm doing alright
Well, I guess I'm doing alright

[Verse 4]
Well, I hate to see this evening end
God only knows when I'll see you again
Just send a fax or send me a letter
Or give me a call, that would even be better
Give the kids a kiss for me
And say hello to the family
And tell them all my future's looking bright
Well, I miss 'em but I'm doing alright
I said I miss 'em but I'm doing alright

[Chorus]
Oh, I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
It's a beautiful day, not a cloud in sight
So I guess I'm doing alright
I'm all, I'm all, I'm alright
Got a good old friend here with me tonight

It should've been different, but it wasn't different, was the
Same old story, ""Dear John,"" and so long
It should've fit like a glove, it should've fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring, a token of true love

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinkin' 'bout all you're missin' how
Deep you're sinkin', 'round and 'round and draggin' down
Why don't you cash in your chips, why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss, chalk it up to better luck

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Could've been true love, but it wasn't
It should all add up, but it doesn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
You can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Should've all worked out, but it didn't
She should be here now, but she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble, there's your trouble
You keep seein' double with the wrong one
And you can't see I love you, you can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holdin' on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
There's your trouble

Yo...yo...
Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I run right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
But then again too many yes-men...

Hustle big, hustle small
All y'all relate to it
I'm a a culture power, baby, when I slide right through it
What the biz, money? You know John and what it is
Then again too many yes-men inside the business
We stay grungy
Risk take on streets like a bungee
Hoes get nothing from me
I'm-a die feeling hungry
Rappers too complacent
I make hits in the basement
Got all the men on top wondering where they placement
If it's real, then it's real
And it ain't no replacement
Them jealous cats who talk need to all walk adjacent
I trifold y'all all into a image my mold
So I can teach you how to walk, eat, drink, and buy gold
My shit is iz-ill
Wear three condoms out in Brazil
Brothers from the 'ville no fault at the iz-ill
Wanna have a duke? Get real! How you fiz-eel?
You couldn't stick me if you brought the chisel
What the diz-eal?
Eat four stars at every miz-eal
You kiz-ill the vibe
You just high from the twiz-ill
And sti-zill I flow riz-ill, leave you fiz-ill
And leave y'all all stuck like Jack from without the Jiz-ill
What?

Find John at the strip spot
Juggling three who all know to keep their lips locked

Fuck the floss
I'm the boss when I rock flip-flops
Culture hip-hop
Before I take your head you should skip bop
Or find us in your homes with the chrome and the shits cocked
What?
Hey y'all pose hard, but they rip up
I leave them enemies with their lips shut
Did what?
Yo money ease up how you cease us
You better off reefin' lighting trees up
Smoking with your mens fantasizing something swiftly

Sawed off shotguns and coonskin caps

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through

Or are you unforgiven too?

One true time I hold to

Well a motherfucker used to say I might be broke
But now I'm stackin C-notes, still dope
Different strokes, same folks; hangin from a rope
Me and Do or Die just try to cope
Sit back I might come let ya take a toke
Take a stroll through the hood
It's some haters but it's still all good
Roll up another blackwood, playa pimpin to the groove
In the place to be to see who I can choose
Now it's time for me to make a move
Shawty what's the deal?

[Twista]
I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be ""Passin' Me By""
I'm a nigga with P's and I ain't stingy with the trees
We could be some freaks and both of our ass could be high
Fe's drips at us full of octane
With pimp status and a hot name, we don't gotta pop thangs
They was serving the rock 'caine, then I came
Flippin flows like hoes when Twista drop game
It's like, awww suki suki now, lookie here
Sing a phrase while I trace on my hog road
Devine words form the pimp scroll
Get the bitch if I'm walkin and she peepin that my limp's cold
See a playa po' trippin, deep as the Mediterranean
Trying to play me in slow-vision
Picture how I'm mackin cold women
Bendin and grinnin my head spinnin
While we smokin on hemp, we still po' pimpin'

Refrain: Johnny P (repeat 2X)

Do you wanna ride, slip inside of your thighs

881,1998,Sister 7,Know What You Mean,"Hey man, come on over here
Let me play some of nothin' for your ears
Well, I sat down and listened to him say
Love keeps gettin' in the way

Well, how many times will I fall in love
With a girl that was my friend?
You see love is a hole in the middle of my heart
Like a well that has no end and I said

Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, yeah

She said, hey man, come on let's go
Let me tell you about something that you don't know
Well, I paced the floor, listened to her say
Love keeps gettin' in the way

And how many times will I fall in love
With a boy that was my friend?
You see love is a pole that blocks the door
With a key the boy can't lend and I said

Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, yeah

Well, I tried to find some reason why
I know our love is better but I've been sinkin', yeah, I've been sinkin'
Well, I tried to find a corner in my mind
Leave it all behind, but I've been thinkin', yeah, I've been thinkin'
We can put it all together babe, we've got plenty of time

I remember sittin' 'neath the stars
Talkin' 'bout love in a broken down car
He said, what are we gonna do, we've lost our way
And love keeps gettin' in the way

Well, I replied to the question on his face
Said, love's not a time or a convenient place
Got rocks in you shoes, you gotta fly
If it's love there is no question why, he said

Oh yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need
There's a soul out there that yours wants to find
Set your spirit free and I said
Oh, yeah, I know what you mean
'Cause a friend in love is a friend in need, oh yeah, oh yeah

And I've been sinkin', I've been sinkin', babe"

It may sound a little extreme I'll do what I have to do

Chorus:
Bury your jacket in my backyard
Carry your picture in my shoe
Keep walking till the hurting stops
Keep walking till my temperature drops
Keep walking till the fever is gone
And you're out of my bones

I'm in need of a medicine
Something strong that'll work real fast
That I can take to fortify me
To keep my arm from taking you back
Chase that ghost out from under my bed
Still these voices in my head
They keep talking weaving their spell
But I'm talking to myself
I keep em talking to daylight to dawn
Till you're out of my bones

Sweet amnesia come and set me free
I just need to get you out of me"

Uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Jay-Z)]
You belong to the city (uh-uhh-uh, what what)
You belong to the night (uh-uhh-uh, ge-ge-geyeah)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
What the deal, playboy? Just rest your soul
I be holding it down yo, still love the dough
Got these ladies on the cock, now you know how we go
Got the whole world on lock down, you know how we flow
Don't worry about Brooklyn, I continue to flame
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns
And just like your spirit, the Commission remains
Niggas can cross the T's and, dots the I's
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies
I'm taking this rap shit serious, to my demise
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise
Basics in the basement, wasted
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit
My hatred is, fueled just give me a sign
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Jay-Z)]
You belong to the city (the city is mine, what-what-what)
You belong to the night (ge-ge-geyeah, uh-uhh-uh, pa-pau)
In the river of darkness
He's a man of the night (the city is mine, that's right...)

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Y'all wanna know how I flow just seek and you find
I'm like a brain in the voice box, I speak my mind
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm
The illest nigga doing it or these niggas is losing it
I read a article that said I was ruining shit
But every time I look, I'm moving units in quick
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split
And leave niggas with nothing but my influences-es
Students of Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit
I'm the type to buy a Rollie and just ice my shit
On the spot, fuck coming back twice to shit
How real is that? My floss game, still intact
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that
Like the first dude to cop the 850 in '89
And drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Jay-Z)]
You belong to the city (the city is mine)
You belong to the night (yeah, uhh, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (pa-pause, feel me)
He's a man of the night (yeah, yeah, bounce, bounce)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I snatch your girl 'cause your arm ain't strong enough
Plus y'all don't stay in the studio long enough
I make hits while y'all stay hating and take bricks
Had it locked 'til I came in the club, Take 6
Got your chick 'cause you swore she was innocent
Got her a Chinese manicure, hair done by Dominicans, all for what
So I could be in a dark corner, all in her butt
At the bar alchoholing her up
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name
I ain't a player, get it right, I'm controlling the game
From now until they blow holes in my frame
I'ma stand firm, holding my aim, feel me?
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime
On the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine!

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Jay-Z)]
You belong to the city (uh-huh, yeah, the city is mine)
You belong to the night (ah ah, the city is mine)
In the river of darkness (feel me, the city is mine)
He's the man of the night (the city is mine, is mine, is mine, is mine)
You belong to the city
You belong to the night
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the night

[Outro: Blackstreet]
You belong
You belong
In the river of darkness
He's the man of the night"
884,1998,Spice Girls,Too Much,"[Verse 1: Scary & Baby]
Love is blind, as far as the eye can see
Deep but meaningless words to me
Easy lover, I need a friend
Road to nowhere, twist and turns but will this never end

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Well my dear you'll know that he pleases me (pleases me)
But short term solution ain't no resolution
That ain't no release for me

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Verse 2: Ginger & Posh]
Unwrap yourself from around my finger
Hold me too tight or left to linger
Something fine built to last
Slipped up there, I guess we're running out of time too fast

[Pre-Chorus: Sporty]
Yes my dear you know he soothes me (moves me)
There's no complication, there's no explanation
It's just a groove in me

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough (bad enough)
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough (just as tough)
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Bridge: Sporty]
What part of no don't you understand
(understand, understand)
I want a man not a boy who thinks he can
Boy who thinks he can

[Chorus: All]
Too much of something is bad enough
But something's coming over me to make me wonder
Too much of nothing is just as tough
I need to know the way to feel to keep me satisfied

[Outro: All]
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie
Too much of nothing so why don't we give it a try
Too much of something we're gonna be living a lie"
885,1998,Christion,I Wanna Get Next To You,"Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you
Ah baby, to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way

Girl, I'm spending my dimes, wasting
My time, talking till I'm black and blue
Ah, can't you see I wanna get next to you?

Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine
(You're so fine)
And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure

Why must you be unkind
(And tell me I'm not your kind, blowin' my mind)
Girl, my, my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places

You might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you

Girl, you can bend me, shake me, make me
Whatever it takes to please you, I'm willing to do
'Cause you're my dream come true
And I wanna get next to you

I wanna get next to you
I wanna make you mine

I wanna get next to you

I promise I'll never make you blue
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you"
886,1998,Tim McGraw,One Of These Days,"[Verse 1]
We used to chase that boy home from school
We called him freckled-face red-headed fool
He was different, he wasn't cool like me
Sticks and stones didn't break any bones
But we never left well enough alone
Then one day he ran away from home you see

[Pre-Chorus]
And I passed him as he walked away
And in his eyes I heard him say

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the times you pushed and shoved me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're gonna love me

[Verse 2]
Patty Sue was a small town beauty
I took one look at her and had to pull her to me
Lord knows she should have seen right through me
When I promised her the world
But at 17 you only want one thing
I left her standin' with my high school ring
Innocent tears in a pourin' rain
As I walked away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still see her in my dreams
And to this day she's whispering

[Chorus]
One of these days you're gonna love me
You'll sit down by yourself and think
About the time you turned from me
And what good friends we might have been
And then you're gonna sigh a little
And maybe even cry a little
But, one of these days
You're going to love me

[Bridge]
Now everybody stands up
The congregation sings
It's a song of sweet forgiveness
And as the chorus rings
The wind blows clear my memory
The pages start to turn
Then suddenly I'm singing
The moment that I learn

[Chorus]
One of these days I'm gonna love me
And feel the joy of sweet release
One of these days I'll rise above me
And at last I'll find some peace
And then I'm gonna smile a little
And maybe even laugh a little
But, one of these days
I'm gonna love me"

Just rain on me
Just rain down (on) on me

Well I ain't had nothin' to drink
I knew that's probably what you'd think
If I'd drop by this time of night
Remember way back when
I promised you I'd drop in
At one of those meetings down at the ""Y""

[Verse 2]
They started talking' about steps you take
Mistakes you make the hearts you break
And the price you pay
I almost walked away

[Verse 3]
You could hear a pin drop
When this old man
Stood up and said I'm gonna say it again
Like I do every week
For those who don't know me

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Verse 4]
This old boy stood up in the isle
Said he'd been living' a life of denial
Then he cried, as he talked about wasted years
I couldn't believe what I heard
It was my life word for word
And all of the sudden, it was clear

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

[Bridge]
I know for us it may be too late
But it would mean the world to me
If you were there when I stand to say

[Chorus]
It's the simple things in life
Like the kids at home and a loving' wife
That you miss the most, when you lose control
And everything you love starts to disappear
The devil takes your hand and says no fear
Have another shot, just one more beer
Yeah I've been there
That's why I'm here

That's why I'm here"

Swimming with a memory that he can't drown

893,1998,Blessid Union Of Souls,Light In Your Eyes,"I can't remember the last time that we kissed goodbye
All our ""I love you""s were just not enough to survive
Something your eyes never told me
But it's only now too plain to see
Brilliant disguise when you hold me
And I'm free

I've been thinking and here's what I've come to conclude
Sometimes the distance is more than two people can use
But how could I have known girl
It was time and not space you would need
Darling tonight I could hold you and you would know
But would you believe

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
There's a place in your heart where I used to be
Was I wrong to assume that you were waiting for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Cards and phone calls and photograph pictures of you
Constant reminder of all the things you get used to
Is there a chance in Hell or Heaven
That there's still something here to build on
Or do you just pick up the pieces after they fall
But after all

There's a light in your eyes that I used to see
And a song in the words that you spoke to me
Was I wrong to believe in your melody
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me

Should I keep on waiting or does love keep on fading away
Fading away

It's been a while since I've seen you so how have you been
Did you get my letter I wrote you that I did not send
I tried to call your old number
But the voice that I heard on the phone
I recognized but she told me the number was wrong

There's a light in my eyes it's too bright to see
And a pain in my heart where you used to be
Guess I was wrong to assume that you were waiting here for me
There's a light in your eyes
Did you leave that light burning for me"
894,1998,Lisa Loeb,Let's Forget About It,"I told you I was sorry
I told you I was wrong

But you love to circle round and round, you're so misunderstood
Yeah, you love to circle round and round and you know that we should
Forget about it--

Let's forget about it

You lied about how much you knew, I thought you were my friend
You lied upon the matrtress, c'mon, tell me where ya been
You lied about this night apart, you lied about the room
If you're gonna have to lie to me then--

Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it

Then, I'll stop cryin' on the mountain that we made from the molehill where we spilt the milk
Yeah, I'll stop cryin' on the mountain that we made from the molehill where we spilt the milk

So you say this never happened, just not the way I thought
Did I throw this out of focus - or was it just the way we fought?
But it seemed to me you took this girl, but you swear to God it's not. (oh)

Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it
Let's forget about it (Let's forget about it)

I'll stop cryin, if you'll stop

It's alright, girl you know you can stay the night
Girl, when you come over
When you come over, come over

[Verse 1]
Come over to my place, yeah, we can get it kickin'
Cook you up a little something in the kitchen
We can Netflix and chill, baby girl why you flicking?
'Cause I know the only reason you here is for dicking
She moving slow-mo', she rides this D like a pro-roll
Up and down she goes like a yo-yo
But I don't know though
'Cause she's always on the gram, at her man
Popping up like a promo
I got her covered in her Davinci
I stay dripping in Prada, she call me daddy like a father
But then she telling me she miss me
I'm spending figures up on [fridges?]
Girl, you can see me after
She calling fleek up, I'm tryna keep up
Girl I'm outside, come put your feet up
Put you on a jet, let's go out [beefer?]

Come over and relax, I don't want a girl but she got me doin' laps
I see you up on Insta, you a queen and that's facts
But she knows I wanna dig her, so I'm gonna double tap
But this is crunch time, can I see you on your lunch time?
We can take a trip like a [cunch line?]
Come, let's fine dine, she's sippin' white wine
Body like a goddess and your face is lookin' so fine
Uh, but don't think I have forgotten
'Bout them times, where them boys tried to slide
But you'd block 'em, you want them shoes with the spikes, so you got 'em
Then I spank her in the lubes, now, that's what I call a red bottom
Ayy, and she knows she's looking sexy
We riding on the waves, I ain't [Qbert?] on a jet ski
So when I ask her to come over, she let's me
Because she gets me

See you when you come over
You're still feeling hazy, I'm lazy
Let's stay in until it's over

899,1998,Clay Walker,Then What?,"[Verse 1]
Well I got a good friend who's got a good life
He's got two pretty children and a real nice wife
Yet he never seems quite satisfied
I said ""I know what's on your mind
But you better think about it before you cross that line
The grass ain't always greener on the other side""

[Chorus]
Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust?
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt?
Then what, whoa-oh, then what?

[Verse 2]
Well I ain't saying that lookin's a crime
Well I've done my share from time to time
It don't mean that you gotta take that leap
When you're standin' on the brink
Before you jump you gotta step back and think
There's price for ever promise you don't keep

[Chorus]
Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust?
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust
Then what, where you gonna turn
When you can't turn back for the bridges you burn
And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt?
Then what, whoa-oh, then what?

Do what you want, do what you wish
It's your life but remember this
There's bound to be some consequences
Sneakin' under other fences

Then what, what you gonna do
When the new wears off and the old shines through
And it ain't really love and it ain't really lust?
You ain't anybody anybody's gonna trust

And fate can't wait to kick you in the butt?

907,1999,Shania Twain,That Don't Impress Me Much,"[Intro]
Ow
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've known a few guys who thought they were pretty smart
But you've got being right down to an art
You think you're a genius, you drive me up the wall
You're a regular original, a know-it-all

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're a rocket scientist

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much
So you got the brains, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
I never knew a guy who carried a mirror in his pocket
And a comb up his sleeve—just in case
And all that extra hold gel in your hair oughta lock it
’Cause heaven forbid it should fall outta place

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you're Brad Pitt

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the looks, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much
Yeah

[Verse 3]
You're one of those guys who likes to shine his machine
You make me take off my shoes before you let me get in
I can't believe you kiss your car good night
Come on, baby, tell me, you must be joking, right?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-oh, you think you're something special
Oh-oh, you think you're something else
Okay, so you've got a car

[Chorus]
That don't impress me much (Oh, oh, uuh)
So you got the moves, but have you got the touch?
Now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm in the middle of the night
That don't impress me much (Don't impress me)
Oh, oh no, you think you're cool, but have you got the touch?
Now, now, don't get me wrong—yeah, I think you're alright
But that won't keep me warm on the long, cold, lonely night
That don't impress me much
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Okay, so what do you think, you're Elvis or something?
(Whatever)
That don't impress me"
908,1999,Sugar Ray,Every Morning,"[Intro]
Every morning there's a halo hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for
The weekend or a one-night stand

[Verse 1]
Couldn't understand
How to work it out
Once again, as predicted, left my broken heart open
And you ripped it out
Something's got me reeling
Stopped me from believing
Turn me around again
Said that we can do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
(Sugar Ray say)
Ohh
(Every morning)
Ohh
(Every morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)
Ohh
(She always rights the wrong, she always rights, she always rights)
(Shut the door, baby, shut the door, baby)

[Verse 2]
Every morning there's a heartache hanging
From the corner of my girlfriend's four-post bed
I know it's not mine and I know she thinks she loves me
But I never can believe what she said

[Pre-Chorus]
Something so deceiving, when you stop believing
Turn me around again
Said we couldn't do it
You know I wanna do it again

[Chorus]
Ohh
(Every morning)
Ohh
(Every morning when I wake up)
(Shut the door, baby, don't say a word)

For me
Baby
She always rights the wrong
For me

I know it's not mine, but I'll see if I can use it for

Every morning
Every morning when I wake up

Listen

[Chorus]
Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry that your man ain't home
I'm sorry that yours left you alone
It's such a shame
Your man is playing games
And I heard you say
That men are all the same
No, no, no

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the truth, girl
Cause I got proof, girl
Oh I got proof, girl
I got a man at home

[Chorus]
Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me

I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's sure good to me

[Verse 2]
Listen
Now why'd you let him beat you down?
No, no, what's up with that
There's good men around
Don't you know
How beautiful you are inside, girl
And don't you let nobody
Go and steal your pride
Oh no no, I know your thing, girl

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not the truth, girl
Cause I got proof, girl
Oh I got proof, girl
I got a man at home

I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

[Bridge]
I once was where you are
Thought men were all the same
But I never gave up hope
And now my life has changed
Listen to me, girls
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
He always treats me right
We never fight
He sends me flowers
And wines and dines me
Took me home to meet his mama
How he loves me
One bad apple
Don't spoil the whole bunch, girl
Give it one more try
Before you give up on love

[Chorus]
Chanté’s got a man
At home
It hurts me
Your man's leaving you all alone
I can't help it that your baby's bad
Creeping out
Cheating on you
Beating on you
Chanté’s got a man at home
And he's so good to me

Between your legs
Loud and clear
I wanna talk back to her
Make love to her
I wanna hear you scream my name

We can make love in the bedroom floor
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs

Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere

I love the way your body feels
On top of mine so take your time
We got a night
Girl, you know
I like it slow
And I know you like it too, baby

You're shivering
Ooh, you put me close to you
Just let it flow

Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy sing it much
Roll a Dutch, let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I bump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true player's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cause I'm hot now
You got me goin', I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feinin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way to get away
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach in Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday

On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere
We can make love in the bedroom floor
Floatin' on top of my waterbed
I'm kissing you
Running my fingers through your hair
In the hallway making our way beside the stairs
We can do it anywhere
I can love you in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget
On the kitchen floor
As I softly pull your hair
We can do it anywhere, anywhere"
917,1999,Tim McGraw,Please Remember Me,"[Verse 1]
When all our tears have reached the sea
Part of you will live in me
Way down deep inside my heart
The days keep coming without fail
A new wind is going to find your sail
That's where your journey starts

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

[Verse 2]
Just like the waves down by the shore
We're going to keep on coming back for more
Cause we don't ever want to stop
Out in this brave new world you seek
Oh the valleys and the peaks
And I can see you on the top

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me

[Verse 3]
Remember me when you're out walking
When the snow falls high outside your door
Late at night when you're not sleeping
And moonlight falls across your floor
When I can't hurt you anymore

[Chorus]
You'll find better love
Strong as it ever was
Deep as the river runs
Warm as the morning sun
Please remember me
Please remember me"
918,1999,Everlast,What It's Like,"[Verse 1]
We've all seen the man at the liquor store beggin' for your change
The hair on his face is dirty, dreadlocked and full of mange
He ask the man for what he could spare with shame in his eyes
""Get a job, you fucking slob"" is all he replies

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in his shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to sing the blues
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Verse 2]
Mary got pregnant from a kid named Tom who said he was in love
He said. ""Don't worry about a thing, baby doll
I'm the man you've been dreamin' of.""
But three months later he said he won't date her or return her calls
And she sweared, ""Goddamn, if I find that man, I'm cuttin' off his balls!""
And then she heads for the clinic and she gets some static walkin' through the door:
They call her a killer, and they call her a sinner, and they call her a whore!

[Hook 2]
God forbid you ever had to walk a mile in her shoes
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to choose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)

[Bridge]
I've seen a rich man beg
I've seen a good man sin
I've seen a tough man cry
I've seen a loser win
And a sad man grin
I heard an honest man lie
I've seen the good side of bad
And the down side of up
And everything between
I licked the silver spoon
Drank from the golden cup
Smoked the finest green

I stroked the baddest dimes
At least a couple of times
Before I broke their heart

You know where it ends
Yo, it usually depends
On where you start

[Verse 3]
I knew this kid named Max
He used to get fat stacks out on the corner with drugs
He liked to hang out late at night
Liked to get shit faced
And keep pace with thugs

Until late one night there was a big gunfight
Max lost his head
He pulled out his chrome .45
Talked some shit
And wound up dead

Now his wife and his kids are caught in the midst of all of his pain
You know it comes that way
At least that's what they say
When you play the game

[Hook]
God forbid you ever had to wake up to hear the news
Cause then you really might know what it's like to have to lose
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
Then you really might know what it's like (what it's like)
To have to lose..."

Almost made you love me, almost made you cry
Almost made you happy, baby, didn't I, didn't I?
You almost had me thinkin' you were turned around
But everybody knows, almost doesn't count
Almost heard you sayin' you were finally free
What was always missing for you, babe, you found it in me
But, you can't get to heaven half off the ground
Everybody knows, almost doesn't count

[Chorus]
I can't keep on loving you one foot outside the door
I hear a funny hesitation of a heart that's never really sure
Can't keep on tryin' if you're looking for more
Than all that I can give you than what you came here for

[Verse 2]
Gonna find me somebody not afraid to let go
Want a no doubt, be there kind of man - you came real close
But every time you built me up, you only let me down

We both know that I shouldn't be here
This is wrong
And, baby, it's killing me, it's killing you
Both of us trying to be strong
I've got somewhere else to be
Promises to keep
Someone else who loves me
And trusts me fast asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh, ho)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

[Verse 2]
I know that we'll meet again
Fate has a place and time
So you can get on with your life
I've got to be cruel to be kind
Like Dr. Zhivago
All my love I'll be sending
And you will never know
'Cause there can be no happy ending

[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion when you start to cry
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you

[Interlude]
Maybe another time, another day
As much as I want to, I can't stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-ho, I've made up my mind
There is no turning back
She's been good to me
And she deserves better than that

[Chorus]
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh)
To look you in the eye, and tell you I don't love you
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to lie
To show no emotion (oh no) when you start to cry (oh, baby, yeah)
I can't let you see what you mean to me
When my hands are tied and my heart's not free
We're not meant to be, oh no
It's the hardest thing I'll ever have to do (oh-ho)
To turn around and walk away pretending I don't love you"

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead

Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture

My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I'll never get bored

To remind you in case you didn't know
Tell yourself I love you and I don't want you to go
Write this down

Take my words and read them every day
Keep them close by, don't you let them fade away
So you'll remember what I forgot to say
Write this down

[Verse 2]
I'll sign it at the bottom of the page
I'll swear under oath
Cause every single word is true
And I think you need to know

So use it as a bookmark
Stick it on your refrigerator door
Hang it in a picture frame up above the mantel
Where you'll see it for sure

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can find a chisel, I can find a stone
Folks will be reading these words long after we're gone

[Chorus]

Oh, I love you and I don't want you to go
Baby, write this down"
929,1999,Steve Wariner,Two Teardrops,"(bill anderson/steve wariner)
(track 2 - time 4: 29)

Two teardrops were floatin' down the river
One teardrop said to the other
I'm from the soft blue eyes of a woman in love
I'm a tear of joy she couldn't carry
She was so happy she just got married
I was on her cheek when she wiped me away with her glove
I could tell from the look on her face she didn't need me
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

The other tear said we've got a connection
I'm a tear of sorrow born of rejection
I'm from the sad brown eyes of her old flame
She told him they would be lifelong companions
Left him with questions and not any answers
I was on his cheek as he stood there calling her name
I could tell he had a lot of my friends for company
So I drifted on down and caught me a ride to the sea

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
And someday they'll be teardrops again
Released in a moment of pleasure or a moment of pain
Then they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Last night I sat in the waiting room
The nurse walked in and gave me the news
It's a baby girl and they're both fine
An old man sittin' not 10 feet away
Just lost his wife and he said to me
You've got a brand new angel and I've lost mine
I guess the good lord giveth and the good lord taketh away
And we both wiped a teardrop from our face

Oh the ocean's a little bit bigger tonight
Two more teardrops somebody cried
One of them happy and one of them bluer than blue
The tide goes out and the tide comes in
A whole new circle of life begins
Where tears are a part of the pleasure and part of the pain
'til they drift on down and ride to the sea again

Two teardrops floatin' down the river
Two teardrops floatin' down the river"
930,1999,Andy Griggs,You Won't Ever Be Lonely,"Life may not always go your way
And every once in a while you might have a bad day
But I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
The sky turns dark and everything goes wrong
Run to me and I'll leave the light on
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong
Here beside me
Heart and soul baby -- you only
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely

It's still gonna snow and it's still gonna rain
The wind's gonna blow on a cold winter day
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
You're safe from the world wrapped in my arms
And I'll never let go
Baby, here's where it starts
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
Here's a shoulder you can cry on
And a love you can rely on
For as long as I live
There will always be a place you belong

Here beside me
Heart and soul baby -- you only
And I promise you now you won't ever be lonely
No, no, you won't ever be lonely"

Friday night, you and your boys went out to eat, oh
Then they hung out
But you came home around three - yes, you did
If six of y'all went out, ah
Then four of you were really cheap, yeah
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

[Chorus]
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Don't you dare come runnin' back to me
It's not right, but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you, leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, yeah (Ah)

[Verse 2]
I'll pack a bag so you can leave town for a week - yes, I am
The phone rings, and then you look at me
Why'd you turn and look at me?
You said it was one of your friends, down on 54th Street, boy
So why did 213 show up on your Caller I.D.? Oh

[Break-down]
I've been through all of this before
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
Don't think about it, don't think about it
That I would stand around and take some more?
Get gone, get gone
Things are gonna change
Things are going to change, baby
'Cause I won't be a fool anymore
You don't stand no chance, boy
That's why you have to leave
I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So don't turn around to see my face
Don't you turn around
There's no more tears left here for you to see

[Verse 3]
Was it really worth you going out like that? (Tell me, boy)
See, I'm movin' on
And I refuse to turn back, yeah (Back, back)
See, all of this time
I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out, you were making a fool of me, ohh

It's not right, but it's okay
Sho 'nuff okay, ha
I'm gonna make it anyway
Make it anyway
Pack your bags, up and leave
Pack your bags, get out and leave

I'm gonna, I'm gonna, ahh
Close the door behind you, leave your key
Close the door, and leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
I'd rather be alone than unhappy, oh
It's not right, but it's okay
It's not right, it's okay, baby

932,1999,matchbox 20,Back 2 Good,"[Verse 1]
It's nothing, it's so normal
You just stand there
I could say so much
But I don't go there because I don't want to
I was thinking if you were lonely
Maybe we could leave here and no one would know
At least not to the point that we would think so

[Chorus]
Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking about
Somebody else
Well, it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But I'm lonely now
And I don't know how
To get it back to good

[Verse 2]
This don't mean that, you own me, well
This ain't no good, in fact it's phony as hell
Yeah, but things worked out just like you wanted too
If you see me out, you don't know me
Try to turn your head, try to give me some room
Oh, to figure out just what I'm going to do

[Chorus 2]
Because everyone here, hates everyone here for doing
Just like they do
And It's best if we all keep this quiet instead
And I couldn't tell, why everyone here was doing me like they do
But I'm sorry now, and I don't know how
To get it back to good
Everyone here, is wondering what it's like to be with
Somebody else
And everyone here's to blame, and everyone here
Gets caught up in the pleasure of the pain, well everyone hides
Shades of shame, yeah but looking inside we're the same
We're the same
And we're all grown now, yeah, but we don't know how
To get it back to good

[Chorus 3]
Everyone here, knows everyone here is thinking 'bout
Somebody else
And it's best if we all keep this under our heads
I couldn't tell, if anyone here was feeling the way I do
But it's over now, yeah and I don't know how, because it's over now
There's no getting back to good"

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh, beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

[Chorus]
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

[Verse 2]
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

[Chorus]
In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark, cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here"

Yeah I know we can't afford it but life doesn't last too long
This world has gone half-crazy
And knocked us both to our knees
I'm fumbling for the words to try to tell ya
I love you for hangin' onto me

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

Mayday baby, all the rivets popped loose, it's a total tailspin
Too much grindstone, too little time with you
Girl, you know it's wearing thin
Baby let's trade in these teardrops
For warm kisses on skin
You got a drawer full of IOU's
And it's high time you called those things in

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And not a soul would blame you after what I put you through
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

You've passed up so many chances
To walk right out that door
Instead of dodging a champagne cork
And watchin' the wet clothes fall to the floor

When anyone else would've been long gone
Packed it up and headed back home
And you can hide behind a Cheshire cat grin but you know it's true
Yeah anyone else would've gone insane
Called the game on account of rain
Anyone else, anyone else
Anyone but you

Anyone else

I'm gonna make a change in my life
Starting here today
I surrender all my love
I never thought I could
I'm giving all my love away
And there's only one reason that I would

(And baby it's you)
The way you walk, the way you talk
The way you say my name and smile (Baby, you)
The way you move me, the way you soothe me
The way you speak softly through the night (Baby, you)
Every morning you rise and open your eyes
I just wanna be there with you baby
I just wanna be yours, from this day forth

Next year lets call this day our anniversary
The day I put my heart in your hand
And said that it was yours to keep
From this moment on say that you'll always be mine
Cause girl when I'm alone with you
There's only one thing that's on my mind

You think I'm always making
Something out of nothing
You're saying everything's okay
You've always got an answer
Before I ask the question
Whatever you say
Now we can change the subject
Pretend I never brought it up
Same old story anyway
Later we can work it out
Right now you're talked out
Yeah, whatever you say

[Chorus]
Oh I know you can hear me
But I'm not sure you're listening
I hear what you're saying
But still there's something missing
Whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say

[Verse 2]
You say yes you need me
And no you wouldn't leave me
And this should be enough to make me stay
And even though I want to
I don't hear I love you
In whatever you say

Oh whether I go whether I stay
Right now depends on
Whatever you say[3x]"

Oh, I'm in trouble deep
With you
Today I stayed in bed
Can't shake these voices in my head
I've fallen off the edge

If I'm not crazy then baby
This must be love

I would go anywhere
Do anything
No, I don't care
Long as I know
I'll always go
With you

Now it's all making sense
Forever's in the present tense
I know it all begins
With you
And so this story goes
I am yours to have and hold
And I can't wait to grow old

They kissed goodbye at the terminal gate
She said, ""You're gonna be late if you don't go""
He held her tight, said, ""I'll be alright
I'll call you tonight to let you know""
He bought a postcard, on the front, it just said ""Heaven""
With a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loved her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

[Chorus]
Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face
The weather's nice, it's paradise
It's summertime all year and there's some folks we know
They say, ""Hello,"" I miss you so, wish you were here

[Verse 2]
She got a call that night but it wasn't from him
It didn't sink in right away, ""Ma'am, the plane went down
Our crews have searched the ground
No survivors found,"" she heard him say
But somehow she got a postcard in the mail
That just said ""Heaven"" with a picture of the ocean and the beach
And the simple words he wrote her
Said he loves her and they told her
How he'd hold her if his arms would reach

Wish you were here, wish you could see this place
Wish you were near, I wish I could touch your face

Toes in the sand, couldn't get much hotter
Little umbrella shaped margaritas
Coconut oil, tanning señoritas

Hands on the wheel, cruising down the interstate
Gas pedal sticks, carries my car away
I was going as fast as a Rambler goes
I could feel the speed from my head to my toes
Now I know how Richard Petty feels

I've been around the block a time or two
Done almost everything a boy can do
I've done some living, yeah I've had fun
But there is one thing that I haven't done

Saved two months, bought a little diamond
Tonight’s the night, feels like perfect timing
Down on one knee on momma's front steps
Man I'm going to die if she really says yes

Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by

Remember the good times that we had?
I let them slip away from us when things got bad
How clearly I first saw you smilin' in the sun
Wanna feel your warmth upon me, I wanna be the one

I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
Standin' on the edge of something much too deep
It's funny how we feel so much but we cannot say a word
We are screaming inside, but we can't be heard

But I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

I'm so afraid to love you, but more afraid to lose
Clinging to a past that doesn't let me choose
Once there was a darkness, deep and endless night
You gave me everything you had, oh you gave me light

And I will remember you
Will you remember me?
Don't let your life pass you by
Weep not for the memories

958,1999,Dixie Chicks,Tonight The Heartache's On Me,"[Verse 1]
Coulda heard a pin drop
When they walked through the door
I had to turn my eyes away
My heart fell to the floor
Someone whispered, ""Where's her halo?""
'Cause she had an angel's face
He stood there smilin', holdin' on
To the one who took my place

[Chorus]
So tonight, the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

[Verse 2]
I wonder if he told her
She's the best he's ever known
The way he told me every night
When we were all alone
She'll find out when the new wears off
He'll find somebody new
She'll learn what the heartache's all about
And what I'm goin' through

[Chorus]
But tonight, the heartache's on me, on me, yeah
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me
So tonight the heartache's on me, on me
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine
Tonight the heartache's on me

[Chorus]
But tonight, the heartache's on me, on me, yeah
Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see

Let's drink a toast to the fool who couldn't see
Bartender pour the wine 'cause the hurtin's all mine

You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed

[Chorus]
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again

[Verse 2]
Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance

[Pre-Chorus]
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
Whoa, oh, no, no, no, ooh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm
Ohh

Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again (Oh baby, yeah, yeah)
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah

Someday you and me (Just give me one more try)
In love again, yeah

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 1]
We were out on a date in my daddy's car
We hadn't driven very far
There in the road, straight up ahead
A car was stalled, the engine was dead
I couldn't stop, so I swerved to the right
I'll never forget the sound that night
The screaming tires, the busting glass
The painful scream that I heard last

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

[Verse 2]
When I woke up, the rain was pouring down
There were people standing all around
Something warm running through my eyes
But somehow I found my baby that night
I lifted her head, she looked at me and said
""Hold me, darling, just a little while""
I held her close, I kissed her our last kiss
I found the love that I knew I would miss
But now she's gone, even though I hold her tight
I lost my love, my life that night

Oh where, oh where can my baby be?
The Lord took her away from me
She's gone to heaven, so I got to be good
So I can see my baby when I leave this world

How does it feel to treat me like you do?
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me, now, how do I feel?

How does it feel?
How should I feel?
Tell me how does it feel

Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They'll turn away no more
And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today

I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me, how do I feel?
Tell me, now, how should I feel?
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to leave me
When I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold

How does it feel?
How should I feel?
Tell me how does it feel
To treat me like you do

How should I feel?

Gonna have myself a night to remember

I just surrender
And have myself a night to remember

Times are tough on an honest heart
People don't follow through with what they start
Lying eyes looking at me up and down
Making talk that's only cheap
Making promises they never keep
But I keep looking for what I still haven't found

One honest heart
That I can believe in
Two loving arms that will never let me go
One good man that I can count on
It shouldn't be so hard
Finding one honest heart

Now I've been close a time or two
I thought I saw my dreams coming true
But I was just living in a fairy tale

I won't play a game that I can't win
But I still have faith and I keep telling myself, there's

Just once in my life I want to be touched by

Been jaded

What's so different? (Uh huh)
Baby (Say what?)
What's so different? (Uh huh)
Yeah (Bom, bom, bom, bom yeah)
If you cheated on him
How I know you ain't gon' do it to me?
(Can you feel this? Bom bom bom bom, yeah)
I need to tell you something
Check this out
(Uh, Ginuwine, check)

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
But at one time you loved him
So what's so different?
Tell me if you were in my shoes
What would you do or think of me?
Would you trust me?

But you feeding me all this rap about
How it's different
But it's not mentioned what you're doin' is wicked
Now I'm having second thoughts about you and me
Cuz this not how I want it or it should be

[Chorus]
You say you want my trust and
Told me you were leavin'
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

You're creepin' on him for me
But you say ""just trust me""
How am I to know that you won't do it to me?
You're tellin' me it's different
But what the hell is different?
If you cheated on him you'll do it to me

[Verse 2]
(Check this out)
Like the saying goes, you reap what you sow
And what goes around comes back around
To you five times harder
And I'm pretty sure that he's thinkin'
That you're totally his
But you're here in my rimmed-up drop top wit me
All hugged up and all over me
Kissin' all of me
Is that to get me where you want me to be?
Don't want this to happen to me
So I'll drop you off, go back to your man
Cuz really, this ain't me

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Baby, uh uh uh, uh uh uh (Say what?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
Uh uh uh (Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)
(Can ya feel me? Can ya feel me?)

[Breakdown]
Uh, Woo! Woo!
(Uh, ya see?)
Don't tell him baby
(You don' went too far now, baby)
You won't do this shit to me
(Yo G, bring the bridge in)

[Bridge]
Baby tell me one thing
How could yo do it?
What did he do to you?
Does he know he blew it?
Or is it just that
You wanna get even
Baby, if that's not it
Please tell me the reason
(Tell me, tell me)

I just don't wanna
Get caught up in drama
If you don't want him
Just tell him, don't cheat on him
(What?)
If you don't tell him
Me and you can't be
Cuz tell me how I'll know
You won't do that shit to me?
(Not to me baby)
You would do it to me

977,1999,SHeDAISY,Little Good-Byes,"(Ooooo, Ooooo)
I'm gonna tell you something you don't wanna hear
You never listen when I talk
Maybe you'll listen when I walk
So I made my mind up and made a sandwich
And I didn't shed a tear
I gave you one last minute of my time
In this mess I left behind
When you come home tonight
And turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

[Chorus 1]
My little good-byes
Empty hangers by the closet door
Lipstick tube on the bathroom floor
My little good-byes
Unpaid bills by the kitchen phone
I took the Beatles, left Billy Joel
Little good-byes, little good-byes

I'm sure, you're sure I'll be back in just an hour or two
You'll tape a Hallmark to my door
They always said it better than you
And if you're wondering
When you're gonna hear from me
Well, take a real good look around boy
And it won't hard to see
When you come home tonight and turn on the light
Don't you be surprised to find

[Chorus 2]
My little good-byes
Took your favorite Dodger's hat
Left the litter, but I took the cat
My little good-byes
Loaded up the TV in the back of my car
Have fun watching the VCR
Little good-byes, oh baby, little good-byes

[Bridge]
So, cry to your mama
And your sympathetic friends and tell'em
And tell them how the story ends

[Chorus 3]
My little good-byes
Took the hourglass, left the sand
Now you got time on your hands
My little good-byes
Took the statue from Japan
Funny little Buddha man

[Chorus 4]
My little good-byes
Change my voice on the machine
Or there'll be little good-byes with every ring
My little good-byes
Left the pictures and took the frame
I've got the umbrella, here comes the rain
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Little good-byes
Rain - yeah, yeah, yeah
Little good-byes
Hey, hey - yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey, hey - yeah, yeah, yeah

978,1999,Ty Herndon,Hands Of A Working Man,"[Verse 1]
At the local diner just outside of town
He comes in an hour early just to beat the morning crowd
He stares out the window and stirs his coffee cup
Another day, another dollar short of catching up

[Pre-Chorus]
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings

[Chorus]
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet
A secondhand car, a washing machine
They may not have much, but he gets what they need
With the hands of a working man

[Verse 2]
Down at the factory, standing in line
He waits to punch the time clock
A million worries on his mind
Oh, Jimmy's needing braces
And Betty's needing time
And the problems that he's facing
They're all building up inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Same old job and same old dull routine
But in his heart, he knows what it brings

[Chorus]
A two bedroom house for his family of three
He's givin' his all, making ends meet

They don't have much, but he gets what they need

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
Millennium

Some say that we are players
Some say that we are pawns
But we've been making money
Since the day that we were born
Got to slow down
Cause we're low down
Run around in circles
Live a life of solitude
Till we find ourselves a partner
Someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down
Before we fall down

We've got stars directing our fate
And we're praying it's not too late
Cause we know we're falling from grace

Overdose at Christmas
And give it up for Lent

981,1999,Lee Ann Womack,I'll Think Of A Reason Later,"I heard he was gonna marry some girl from Denver
Then my sister came over
Had the Sunday paper with her
There was the girl on the social page
Looking in love and all engaged
We decided she don't take a very good picture

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

I drew horns and blacked out her tooth with a marker
Childish, yes, but she made such a thin little target
I couldn't be happier on my own
But I've got the slightest of a jealous bone
And seeing her with him tends to enlarge it

It may be my family's redneck nature
Rubbing off
Bringing out unlady-like behavior
It sure ain't Christian to judge a stranger
But I don't like her
She may be an angel who spends all winter
Bringing the homeless blankets and dinner
A regular Nobel Peace Prize winner
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

Inside her head may lay all the answers
For curin' diseases from baldness to cancer
Salt of the earth and a real good dancer
But I really hate her
I'll think of a reason later

(Spoken)
Well, it was just one tooth
Did I mention I don't particularly care for her?
She makes me sick"

993,1999,The Offspring,Why Don't You Get A Job?,"[Verse 1]
My friend's got a girlfriend
Man, he hates that bitch
He tells me every day
He says, ""Man, I really gotta lose my chick
In the worst kind of way.""

She sits on her ass
He works his hands to the bone
To give her money every payday
But she wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

[Chorus]
""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""
Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""

[Verse 2]
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
To keep her bill collectors at bay
I guess all his money, well, it isn't enough
’Cause that girl's got expensive taste

[Chorus]
""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""
Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""

[Bridge]
Well, I guess it ain't easy doing nothing at all
But hey man, free rides just don't come along
Every day

Let me tell you about my other friend now

[Verse 3]
My friend's got a boyfriend
Man, she hates that dick
She tells me every day
He wants more dinero just to stay at home
Well, my friend, you gotta say

[Chorus]
""I won't pay, I won't pay ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""
Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""

[Outro]
""I won't give you no money, I always pay
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""
Say, ""No way,"" say, ""No way-ya, no way
Na-na, why don't you get a job?""

Hey! That's something everyone can enjoy"
994,1999,Nas Featuring Puff Daddy,Hate Me Now,"[Produced by D Moet, Pretty Boy & Trackmasters]

[Intro: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

[Chorus 1: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now, (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-lib over Chorus: Puff Daddy (Nas)]
Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherfuckers! (do it now, do it now)
Fuck y'all!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
Close your eyes, picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Cmon)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

[Ad-Libs: Nas and Puff Daddy]
Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
I like this, I like the way this feels

[Verse 3: Nas]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

[Ad-libs: Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Chorus 2: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now, (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now, (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

[Outro: Puff Daddy and Nas]
You can hate me now, (C'mon, niggas!)
But I won't stop now (Do it now! Get this shit over with!)
It ain't gon' never stop, niggas!"
995,1999,Chad Brock,Ordinary Life,"Shelly's at the kitchen table, cup of coffee, the morning paper
When he walks in she's so surprised to see the tears in his eyes
He says, ""I love you, I'm so sorry but bigger dreams
Are waiting for me but I can't do this anymore""

Pay the bills, watch TV, day in day out, the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
We go to church, go to work, so picture perfect that it hurts
I feel like I'm trapped inside this ordinary life

Shelly's at the kitchen table, crayons, construction paper
""Hey mom, look what I drew, it's a picture of me and you""
And later when he says his prayers
She runs her fingers through his hair, so thankful for every day

They pay their bills, watch TV, day in day out, it's all they need
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
They go to church, go to school, everyday it's something new
Precious are the days as they go by in their ordinary life

Phone rings, he's calling from the airport
It's midnight, he's all alone again
He says, ""I can't believe how much I've missed
And what I wouldn't give""

To pay the bills, watch TV, day in day out, the same routine
Mow the grass, fix the leak, just to fix it again
Go to church, go to work, I can't tell you how this hurts
I miss my son, I miss my wife and my ordinary life"
996,1999,Montgomery Gentry,Hillbilly Shoes,"I was there when the men came, and told us all the news
Father forgive them for they know not what they do
Till they walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes

You want to judge me by the whiskey on my breath
You think you know me but you ain't seen nothing yet
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes

You work all day in the muck and the mire
Dance a little jig and a stomp by the fire
Ain't too much these boots can't do
Might even kick a little sense into you

Well I'm going up cripple creek going in a run
Going up cripple creek to have a little fun
Law man said they found some tracks
People saw them leavin but they never come back

Oh, you don't know me, you don't know, you don't know you don't know
Till you walk a while, a country mile
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes
In my hillbilly shoes"

Complicate this world you wrapped for me
I'm acquainted with your suffering

[Chorus]
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me

[Verse 2]
Hold me up to those whom you've deceived
Promises you break you still believe

[Chorus]
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it brings me down
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me

All your weight it falls on me
It brings me down
All your weight it falls on me
It falls on me"

Give yo' ass a black eye
Oh, say bye-bye

And the whips better have a whole lotta chips
Cuz I ain't for no nigga givin' tips

Talk mo' junk but won't look my way

Get on down while I shoot my flow

When I do my thang
Got the place on fire, burnin' down to flames

Roll up in my car, don't stop, won't stop
I'mma keep in rockin' til the clock don't tock
I'mma keep it hot, light my ass on fire

Whatcha talk? Whatcha say? Huh?
Gotta flow, gotta move it slow, huh?
Better you runnin' out the door, huh?
You gon' be a long lost soul, whacha say?

Put me on stage, watchin' niggas feel me
Put my shit on wax, watch it blaze like me

Anybody wanna come fuck wit the steel?
Anybody gotta get they whole body peeled?

Ah man, we need to declare this a national holiday
We gonna call this Players Holiday
Ant B-Z what up man?

[Ant Banks]
Rise and shine, make you wanna say
Dear God, let me thank you for another day
For livin' life on the edge and I'm tryin' to break it
Tired of duckin' the Feds, but it's a struggle to make it
So this is your day homey, now it's time to shine
If a player's only trickin', you can wine and dine
Stress free from the drama, better go get your ticket
Then come on cause some squares can't lie to kick it

[Mac Mall]
It feels good not to grind no more
Don't get it twisted cause I still hustle
Maintainin' just tryin' to reach my goal
Livin' life truly successful
So that my little soldier never have to sell no dope
All the Cutties from the pens comin' home again
And we ain't tryin' to kill each other cause brother we all in
Beautiful black women give 'em much respect
And ain't no funk 'tween the east and the west
It's just a Player Holiday

1 - Today's the day the Players play
So you better be on your way
(On your way, your way)
Now it's time to celebrate
Hurry up and don't be late
Cause you know it's gonna be a lovely day

January 1 the year 2000
We gettin' all the money and we ain't through clownin'
You can tell everybody that stays around your way
Today is the official Player's Holiday
Short Dog I'm lovin' every minute of it
Cause pimpin's been around since the beginning of it
We barbecuin' chicken, that's what we doin'
Got some breezys and we kickin'
And Cap what you doin?

[Captain Save Em]
I'm just sittin here timin' like a Rolex watch
I figured by now y'all realize that Hip-Hop and Rap won't stop
Puttin' it together like a racing track
Where's all my Latino, Philippino, and Ese partners at?
I know you feel me when I say that life's a struggle
But God first, y'all know we all can't help but bubble
So keep your head up
And know that things are changing for the better
Talkin' 'bout the youth, the little kids
Forget about you, never

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

[Ant Banks]
Now all the real players throw your Rollies in The air
And wave 'em all around like you just don't care
From side to side and from front to back
Throw the peace sign baby, show me where you at
Dollar bill y'all, and we could scream it out loud
And Mac Mall's here, homey that can move the crowd
So what the deal with you nigga, you could cross the town
Put the squeeze on the haters, ain't no need to clown

[Rappin 4-tay]
None of the homies got pop
None of the spots got batteram
And I'll be damned, it's crackin' like a Summer Jam
Barbecues, no more feuds, players embracin'
Slammin' dominos, bustin' raps, still paper chasin'
Competitors keep a distance, it's all love baby
Rub-a-dub-dub love, welcome to the Players Club baby
A family affair, a toast to the bay, hey
Looks like it's gonna be one of them lovely days

Repeat 2

[Mac Mall]
Mama used to put my clothes on layaway
Now I'm dipped everyday and every C-note got big face
Holler at me man, used to ride the back of the bus
Now I'm spinnin V-12's though the times is rough
In God we trust haters, you can only hate us
But can't front cause you knew that we was bound to blow up
Gettin' paid what we can, Short Dog and Ant Banks
Mac Mall do it big on a Players Holiday, yeah"
