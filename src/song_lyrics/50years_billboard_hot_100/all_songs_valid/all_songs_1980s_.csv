3,1980,Kenny Rogers With Kim Carnes,Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer,"[Verse 1]
Just look at you sitting there
You never looked better than tonight
And it would be so easy to tell you I'd stay
Like I've done so many times

[Verse 2]
I was so sure that this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And it'd be so easy to tell you I'd wait
Like I've done so many times

[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't you fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye

[Verse 3]
Now it's morning, the phone rings
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what I was thinking girl
I'd turn around if you'd just ask me one more time
[Chorus]
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really changed him
He'll leave you again
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
'Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light and just hold on
Before we say goodbye
Before we said goodbye

5,1980,Bette Midler,The Rose,"Some say love, it is a river
That drowns the tender reed
Some say love, it is a razor
That leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love, it is a hunger
An endless aching need
I say love, it is a flower
And you its only seed

It's the heart afraid of breaking
That never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking
That never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken
Who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dyin'
That never learns to live

When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only
For the lucky and the strong
Just remember in the winter
Far beneath the bitter snows
Lies the seed that with the sun's love
In the spring becomes the rose"
6,1980,Bob Seger,Against The Wind,"[Verse 1: Bob Seger]
Seems like yesterday, but it was long ago
Janey was lovely, she was the queen of my nights
There in darkness with the radio playin' low, and

[Verse 2: Bob Seger]
And the secrets that we shared, the mountains that we moved
Caught like a wildfire out of control
'Til there was nothing left to burn and nothing left to prove

[Pre-Chorus 1: Bob Seger]
And I remember what she said to me
How she swore that it never would end
I remember how she held me, oh so tight
Wish I didn't know now what I didn't know then

[Chorus 1: Bob Seger]
Against the wind
We were running against the wind
We were young and strong
We were running against the wind

[Verse 3: Bob Seger]
And the years rolled slowly past, and I found myself alone
Surrounded by strangers I thought were my friends
Found myself further and further from my home and I
[Verse 4: Bob Seger]
I guess I lost my way, there were oh so many roads
I was livin' to run and runnin' to live
Never worried about payin' or even how much I owe

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bob Seger]
Movin' eight miles a minute for months at a time
Breakin' all of the rules that would bend
I began to find myself searchin'
Searchin' for shelter again and again

[Chorus 2: Bob Seger]
Against the wind
Little somethin' against the wind
I found myself seekin' shelter against the wind

[Piano Solo]
2:36 - 3:19

[Pre-Chorus 3: Bob Seger]
Well, those drifters days are past me now
I've got so much more to think about
Deadlines and commitments
What to leave in, what to leave out

[Chorus 3: Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band]
Against the wind
I'm still running against the wind
I'm older now but still running against the wind
[Outro: Bob Seger & (The Silver Bullet Band)]
Well, I'm older now and still running
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
I'm still running
(Against the wind)
I'm still running against the wind
(Against the wind)
Still running
(Against the wind)
Running against the wind, running against the wind
(Against the wind)
See the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man run
(Against the wind)
Watch the young man runnin'
(Against the wind)
He'll be runnin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
Mm
(Against the wind)
Let the cowboys ride
(Against the wind)
They'll be ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
Against the wind
(Against the wind)
Ridin' against the wind
(Against the wind)
(Against the wind)
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride

7,1980,Linda Ronstadt,Hurt So Bad,"Written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Wilding, Bobby Hart
© 1965 Vogue Music (BMI)

I know you
Don't know what I'm going through
Standing here looking at you

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again

Like needles and pins
People say ""you've been making out okay
He's in love don't stand in his way""

Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad
It makes me feel so sad
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you
I'll do anything you want me to
You loved me before please love me again
I can't let you go back to her
Please don't go
Please don't go

Please don't go
Please don't go
Hurt so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
Don't make it hurt so bad
I'm begging you please
Oooooh oh oh oh
Come back it hurts so bad
Come back it hurts so bad
I'm begging you please
Oh! No!
Noooooo!"
8,1980,Gary Numan,Cars,"[Verse 1]
Here in my car
I feel safest of all
I can lock all my doors
It's the only way to live
In cars
Here in my car
I can only receive
I can listen to you
It keeps me stable for days
In cars

[Verse 2]
Here in my car
Where the image breaks down
Will you visit me please
If I open my door
In cars?
Here in my car
I know I've started to think
About leaving tonight
Although nothing seems right
In cars

[Instrumental]"
9,1980,Elton John,Little Jeannie,"[Verse 1]
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be

[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

[Verse 2]
Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth
[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool

[Chorus]
And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you

[Coda]
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie, (Oh, Jeannie) I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new

10,1980,Billy Joel,It's Still Rock And Roll To Me,"[Verse 1]
What's the matter with
The clothes I'm wearing?
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide?
Maybe I should buy some
Old tab collars?
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been
Hidin' out lately, honey?
You can't dress trashy
Till you spend a lot of money

[Chorus]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

[Verse 2]
What's the matter with the car I'm driving?
Can't you tell that it's out of style?
Should I get a set
Of whitewall tires?
Are you gonna cruise
The miracle mile?
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true
Baby blue Continental
[Chorus]
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me

[Bridge]
Oh, it doesn't matter
What they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound
From a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen

[Verse 4]
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
And a bright orange pair of pants?
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you just give it half a chance
Don't waste your money
On a new set of speakers
You get more mileage
From a cheap pair of sneakers

[Chorus]
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
[Saxophone solo]

[Verse 5]
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing?
Don't you know that they're out of touch?
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student?
If you are then you think too much
Don't you know about
The new fashion honey?
All you need are looks
And a whole lotta money

[Chorus]
It's the next phase, new wave
Dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me

[Outro]
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me"
11,1980,Michael Jackson,She's Out Of My Life,"[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
It's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life"
12,1980,Robbie Dupree,Steal Away,"[Instrumental intro]

[Verse 1]
Come on and hold me
Just like you told me
Then show me
What I want to know

[Chorus 1]
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right

[Verse 2]
Don't tease me
Why don't you please me
And show me
What you came here for

[Chorus 1]
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Into the night
I know it ain't right
[Hook]
Into the night, babe
Baby, tonight
Ooh

I caught you glancing my way
And I know what you're after
No second chances tonight

Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away
Why don't we steal away

[Hook]
Into the night
I know it ain't right
Into the night
I know it ain't right

Why don't we steal away
I know it ain't right
Into the night, babe
Why don't we steal away
Make it tonight
Why don't we steal away"

15,1980,Dr. Hook,Sexy Eyes,"I was sitting all alone, watching people getting off, with each other
They were dancing 'cross the floor, turning movement back and forth, they were lovers
One more lonely night for me, I looked up what did I see

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

I got up and took your hand and we both began to dance to the music
Ooh your magic cast a spell, it didn't take long 'til we fell and we knew it
No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be

Sexy eyes, moving 'cross the floor, couldn't want for more, sexy eyes
Sexy eyes, getting down with you, I wanna move with you, sexy eyes

No more lonely nights for me, this is how its gonna be

Toss and turn, fall to sleep holding my pillow tight

All the time I think of you, you're with me no matter what I do

Walk around with a smile upon my face

I am feeling what I can't explain, and if what you're feeling is the same

I realize the best part of love is the thinnest slice
And it don't count for much
But I'm not letting go
I believe there's still much to believe in

[Verse 2]
So lift your eyes if you feel you can
Reach for a star and I'll show you a plan
I figured it out
What I needed was someone to show me

You know you can't fool me
I've been lovin' you too long
It started so easy
You want to carry on (Carry on)

Lost in love and I don't know much
Was I thinkin' aloud and fell out of touch?
But I'm back on my feet
And eager to be what you wanted

19,1980,Pure Prairie League,Let Me Love You Tonight,"Dark clouds are blowing in the wind
He's crossing your mind again
You've got that sad, sad feeling, from a broken heart
Feeling so close to the end

Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright

When you find out how good love can be
You're so lost when it sets you free
They say once in your life you find someone that's right
Someone who loves you like me

Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright

When the moon has forgotten what the night's about
And the stars can't work their places out
Hold me tighter than tight
When the daylight comes it'll be alright

Let me love you tonight
There's a million stars in the sky
Let me love you tonight
I'll make everything alright
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight
Let me love you tonight

20,1980,Bruce Cockburn,Wondering Where The Lions Are,"Sun's up, uuh huh, looks okay
The world survives into another day
And I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
I had another dream about lions at the door
They weren't half as frightening as they were before
But I'm thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Walls windows trees, waves coming through
You be in me and I'll be in you
Together in eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me

Up among the firs where it smells so sweet
Or down in the valley where the river used to be
I got my mind on eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...

Huge orange flying boat rises off a lake
Thousand-year-old petroglyphs doing a double take
Pointing a finger at eternity
I'm sitting in the middle of this ecstasy
Young men marching, helmets shining in the sun
Polished as precise like the brain behind the gun
(should be!) they got me thinking about eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are...

Freighters on the nod on the surface of the bay
One of these days we're going to sail away
Going to sail into eternity
Some kind of ecstasy got a hold on me
And I'm wondering where the lions are...
I'm wondering where the lions are..."

If this is last call

It don't make sense
You'd be a fool

No more tears a falling

I'm on the run

To make it to the border of Mexico
So I'll ride like the wind

Always spoke my mind with a gun in my hand
Lived nine lives
Gunned down ten

So I'll ride like the wind

Never was the kind to do as I was told
Gonna ride like the wind before I get old

Your beauty steals my breath away
When you look into my eyes
I find it hard to find the words to say

Wanna run away and hide
I just got to let you know
Feel so tangled up inside
I should have never let you go

(should have never let her go)

Anyone can make mistakes
And we both have made our share
But a life without your love
Is a life too hard to bear

I don't care who's right or wrong
Only know I love you so
Why did I have to write this song
I should have never let you go

Why in all the wide, wide world
Have I run into you here
Wish I could disappear
I'll never understand
I'll never understand
Why I even give a damn

When you walk into a room
You know I stand on shaky ground
I've built so many walls around me
Now the walls are tumbling down

You're the kind I can't forget
Let the tears begin to flow

I have only one regret
I should have never let you.....go
Should have never let you go

Should have never let you go
Should have never let you go
Should have never let you go"

Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway

From being close together from the start
We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Yet, you're my favorite work of art

I’ll be seeing you
In every lovely summer's day
In everything that's light and gay

I'll be looking at the moon

To one who'll watch over me

A kiss is still a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh

Hearts full of passion (Hearts full of passion)
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers

I couldn't bear it without you
Don’t get around much anymore

32,1980,The Manhattan Transfer,Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone,"With a key, you unlock a door to imagination
Beyond it is another dimension
A dimension of sight
A dimension of sound
A dimension of mind

You're moving through a land of both shadow and substance
Of things and ideas
Guiding you through this wondrous journey
Is the hypnotic sound of the twilight tone

When I hear this melody
This strange illusion takes over me
Through a tunnel of the mind
Perhaps a present or future time oh, oh
Out of nowhere comes this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Pyramidal locomotion
From a mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight
Hearin' the twilight, twilight tone

Unpretentious girl from Memphis
Saw the future through her third eye
People came with skepticism
Picking, testing her precision, no, wo, oh, oh
Suddenly they heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
A signpost up ahead is calling
Through the mystic unknown zone
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, feelin' the rhythm
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight swept away, ba da, loo da, ba da loo da
Hearin' the twilight
Twilight tone

Submitted for your approval. One Mr. Miller, who's about
To take a trip into oddness and obsolescene, through a
Zone whose boundaries are that of imagination
Accompanying him on this journey is the mesmerizing
Sound of the Twilight Tone

On a cold & rainy night
One Mister Miller had a rare flight
Glen was up there boppin' a rhythm
Then the engine stopped to listen with him
Play that beat, oh, oh
Suddenly he heard this sound
This melody that keeps spinning 'round & 'round
Now he resides and plays trombone
In the mystic unknown zone

Hearin' the twilight (repeat many times)
(Hearin' the twilight)"

Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again

Come give me your sweetness
Now there's you, there is no weakness
Lying safe within your arms, I'm born again

I was half, not whole
In step with none
Reaching through this world
In need of one

Come show me your kindness
In your arms I know I'll find this
Woman, don't you know, with you I'm born again
Lying safe with you I'm born again

Come bring me your softness
Comfort me through all this madness

40,1980,Rupert Holmes,Answering Machine,"A little while ago I went and placed a call
To tell this girl I know that she could have it all
The wedding, the ring, the whole dumb thing
I was willing to tie the knot
So I called her up, and this is the answer I got

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through""

And I said, ""Baby, let's go get married
Well, I need to know you're mine
I am hangin' on, I am hangin' on
I am hangin' on this line
And if I can leave one message
Before you go to bed
I would say to you...""
And the phone went dead

So I stepped out to buy some dog food for the cat
Of course she called about three minutes after that
Would she be my wife and share my life?
Well, of course you can write the plot
'Cause she called me up, and this is the answer she got
""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
Leave your name and number
And I'll try and get back to you
You have thirty seconds to talk to me before you're through""

And she said, ""Baby, I got your message
Well, I'm answering your call
I have thought it out, I have thought it out
And I think that all-in-all
If you ask if we can marry, and make it for all time
Then my answer is...""
And the phone went

""I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine
I'm not in at present, I'm sure you know this whole routine
I'm so sorry you have just reached my answering machine

We put our time in cause we like to stay up

Start in the morning and get the job done
Take care of business and we have some fun

Turn it up and then we'll sing along

42,1980,Bobby Caldwell,Coming Down From Love,"From the beginning
You were my life
And through the seasons
I made the sacrifice
Now I remember
What you did to me before
It keeps bringing me down

And the relation
Tore me apart
You were so clever
Girl it broke my heart
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
It keeps spinning around

Darling somehow
Now that you're gone
I have no one
I write you letters
And throw them away
Only a fool keeps hanging on
When love slips away

Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Cause I keep holding on
Coming down from love
And I wonder why it takes so long
Tell me where I went wrong
Through all the changes
Love was so blind
But I continued
Keeping an open mind
Now I remember
Cause I can't forget the past
I keep spinning around"

One fine day, you'll look at me
And you will know our love was, meant to be
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

The arms I long for, will open wide
And you'll be proud to have me, right by your side
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

Though I know you're the kind of boy
Who only wants to run around
I'll keep waiting, and, someday darling
You'll come to me when you want to settle down
Oh!

One fine day, we'll meet once more
And then you'll want the love you threw away before
One fine day, you're gonna want me for your girl

And the sun rises up so high
Lost in another world, far away
Never another word till today

Suddenly came the dawn from the night
Suddenly I was born into light
How can it be real?

Saturday, I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out again
I was only having fun
Wasn't hurting anyone
And we all enjoyed the weekend for a change

[Verse 2]
I've been stranded in the combat zone
I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the rain
And you told me not to drive
But I made it home alive
So you said that only proves that I'm insane

You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
Turn out the light
Don't try to save me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you smiled
You were lonely for a man
I said, take me as I am
Cause you might enjoy
Some madness for a while

[Verse 4]
Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you say
If I'm crazy then it's true
That it's all because of you
And you wouldn't want me any other way

[Chorus]
You may be right
I may be crazy
But it just may be a lunatic
You're looking for
It's too late to fight
It's too late to change me
You may be wrong for all I know
But you may be right

Leaving me out

Never do last
Are gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone, and in a hurry

In this old hotel
And rooms filled with reckless pride
And the walls have grown sturdy
And the halls have worn well

Gonna pull in the shutters
On this heart of mine
Roll up the carpets
And pull in the blinds
And retreat to the chambers
That I left behind
In hopes there still may be love left to find
Still may be love left to find

Seek inspiration in daily affairs
Now your soul is in trouble and requires repairs
And the voices you hear at the top of the stairs
Are only echoes of unanswered prayers
Echoes of unanswered prayers

Well speaking just for me

We've got a thing or two to tell you all

But she ain't never fell
And if the Russians don't believe that
They can all go straight to hell
We're gonna put her feet back
On the path of righteousness and then
God bless America again

That it ever would happen again (In America, did you?)

That we'd ever get together again

And we're talking real loud again (In America)

Out to San Francisco Bay
And everything that's in between them is our own
And we may have done a little bit
Of fighting among ourselves
But you outside people best leave us alone
Cause we'll all stick together
And you can take that to the bank
That's the cowboys and the hippies
And the rebels and the yanks
You just go and lay your hand
On a Pittsburgh Steelers fan
And I think you're gonna finally understand

'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!

You used to think that love was worth the time
When love was all we had
We didn't need distraction all the time
Or being made to laugh

And then you said we had to build a home
And love alone could not provide
Oh-oh-oh, you said that money would never get us down
You didn't know you lied

Now loneliness is there despite the love we make
Oh, and loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And the place we live is just a new street number
On an old address called love and loneliness

I sometimes wonder how you see us now
I'd read your mind if I had the chance
Oh-oh-oh, I don't know if I'd ever find our love in there
Or just old photographs

And now loneliness is there despite the love we make
Oh,  and loneliness knows where to find the friends we make
And your friends call 'round and they act amazed
You show them 'round and they stand and praise
The life we live that's just a new street number

She was dark at the top of the stairs

And so I followed
As friends often do
I cared not for love, nor money
And I think she knew
Well the people, they love her
And still they are the most cruel

Some say illusions are her game

93,1980,Mac Davis,It's Hard To Be Humble,"[Spoken Intro]
Back a few months ago, I was headlinin' a great big nightclub
And they put me up a couple days early, I came in a couple days early
And they put me up in what they call the ""Star Suite""
Now here I am, headlinin' in one of the biggest nightclubs
In the country and I wake up at eight o'clock in the morning
In this ""Star Suite"" all by myself

Crowd: Awwww

Mac: Yeah, that's what I said, ""Awwwww.""
But I did what I've always done, man, to cheer myself up
I picked up my guitar, I sat down and I wrote me a little song
Now this is how it feels to be alone at the top of the hill
Tryin' to figure out why

[Chorus]
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
I can't wait to look in the mirror
'Cause I get better lookin' each day
To know me is to love me
I must be a hell of a man
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
But I'm doin' the best that I can!
[Verse 1]
I used to have a girlfriend
But I guess she just couldn't compete
With all of these love-starved women
Who keep clamoring at my feet
Well I probably could find me another
But I guess they're all in awe of me
Who cares? I never get lonesome
'Cause I treasure my own company

[Chorus]
Ohh
Lord, it's hard to be humble
When you're perfect in every way
(Can't wait to look in the mirror)
I can't wait to look in the mirror
(Help me out now, come on)
I get better lookin' each day
(To know me is to what?)
To know me is to love me
(Must be a hell of a man)
I must be a hell of a man
(Oh Lord, it's hard)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(When you doin' what?)
We're doin' the best that we can
[Verse 2]
I guess you could say I'm a loner
A cowboy outlaw, tough and proud
Well, I could have lotsa friends if I wanted
But then I wouldn't stand out from the crowd
Some folks say that I'm ""egotistical""
Hell, I don't even know what that means!
I guess it has something to do with the way
That I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans

[Chorus]
Ohh
(Come on, where's all the kickers in here?!)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(When you're perfect in every way)
When you're perfect in every way
(Can't wait to look in the mirror)
I can't wait to look in the mirror
(Cause I get better lookin')
I get better lookin' each day
(To know me is to what?)
To know me is to love me
(Must be a hell of a man)
I must be a hell of a man
(Oh Lord, it's hard)
Oh Lord, it's hard to be humble
(What are we doin'?)
We're doin' the best that we can
(One more time, what are we doin'?)
We're doing the best that we can!
Give yourselves a hand
Yee-haw"
94,1980,Bob Seger,Fire Lake,"Who's goin' to ride that chrome three-wheeler?
Who's goin' to make that first mistake?
Who wants to wear those gypsy leathers
All the way to Fire Lake?

Who wants to break the news about Uncle Joe?
You remember Uncle Joe
He was the one afraid to cut the cake
Who wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah
Joe's run off to Fire Lake?
Joe's run off to Fire Lake

Who wants to brave those bronzed beauties
Lyin' in the sun
With their long soft hair falling
Flying as they run
Ah they smile so shy and they flirt so well
And they lay you down so fast
Till you look straight up and say
Oh lord, am I really here at last?

Who wants to play those eights and aces?
Who wants a raise, who needs a stake?
Who wants to take that long-shot gamble
And head out for Fire Lake?
Head out
Who wants to go to Fire Lake
Head out

Hey, head out

Look at us baby, up all night
Tearing our love apart
Aren't we the same two people who live
Through years in the dark? Ah ahh

Every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay

[Chorus 1]
And I can't tell you why

When we get crazy, it just ain't right

Girl, I get lonely, too

96,1980,Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers,Here Comes My Girl,"[Verse 1]
You know sometimes, I don't know why
But this old town just seems so hopeless
I ain't really sure, but it seems I remember the good times
Were just a little bit more in focus
But when she puts her arms around me
I can somehow rise above it
Yeah, man, when I got that little girl standin' right by my side
You know, I can tell the whole wide world to shove it, hey!

[Chorus]
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Verse 2]
Every now and then I get down to the end of the day
I have to stop and ask myself why I've done it
It just seems so useless to have to work so hard
And nothin' ever really seems to come from it
And then she looks me in the eye and says, ""We're gonna last forever""
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!
[Chorus]
Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl
Yeah, and she looks so right
She is all I need tonight

[Bridge]
Watch her walk

[Verse 3]
Every time it seems like there ain't nothin' left no more
I find myself having to reach out and grab hold of something
Yeah, I just catch myself wondering, waiting, and worrying
About some silly little things that don't add up to nothin'
And then she looks me in the eye and says, ""We're gonna last forever""
And man, you know I can't begin to doubt it
No, 'cause it just feels so good, and so free, and so right
I know we ain't never gonna change our minds about it, hey!

Here comes my girl
Here comes my girl

Honey don't go, don't leave this scene
Be out of the picture and off of the screen
Don't let them say ""we told you so""
They tell me you'll love me and then let me go

From friends and my relations
They tell me all about your heart-break reputation

I don't care what they say.. no
I don't care what they think, if you're leaving

I don't care about anything else
But being with you, being with you
People can change, they always do
Haven't they noticed the changes in you?
Or can it be, that like love I am blind?
Do I want it so much 'til it's all in my mind?

One thing I know for sure
Is really really real
I never felt before the way you make me feel

I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say

Of love so true, that once turned all my gray skies blue

I'm wishin' you were here with me
Soft with love are my thoughts of you
Now that you're gone, oh, I don't know what to do

That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love
In my life
I've felt so self-assured
But oh how the seasons change
And now I'm not that strong

'Cause I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this hell
Living outside your love

Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I am lost

Not for those who wait too late

We've been traveling far
Without a home
But not without a star
Free
Only want to be free
We huddle close
Hang on to a dream
On the boats and on the planes
They're coming to America
Never looking back again
They're coming to America
Home, don't it seem so far away
Oh, we're traveling light today
In the eye of the storm
In the eye of the storm

Home, to a new and a shiny place
Make our bed, and we'll say our grace
Freedom's light burning warm
Freedom's light burning warm
Everywhere around the world
They're coming to America
Every time that flag's unfurled
They're coming to America
Got a dream to take them there
They're coming to America
Got a dream they've come to share
They're coming to America

They're coming to America

To help you dry your eyes

Who love you from the start
Who treats you like a star
Oh sweetheart

Who loves you baby
Who loves you wrong or right
'Cause you're the spark in my life
Yeah day and night

110,1981,George Harrison,All Those Years Ago,"[Verse 1]
I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

[Bridge]
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

[Verse 3]
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago
[Instrumental Break]
All those years ago
All those years ago

[Bridge]
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of the lies
And all else that we despised

[Verse 4]
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all, though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us
Some people can hold it together
Last through all kinds of weather
Can't we

Now don't you get me wrong (watcha you saying to me baby)
'Cause I'm not tryin' now to end it all (let's start something new)
It's just that I have seen (what have you seen)
Too many lover's hearts lose their dreams (we won't lose it)

Some people can love one another for life
How 'bout us

How about us, how about us baby (x3)
Are we going to make it girl

I hadn't a care
Fooling around
Hitting the town
Growing my hair

You came along
And stole my heart
When you entered my life
Ooh, babe
You got what it takes
So I made you my wife

Since then
I never looked back
It's almost like living a dream
And, ooh
I love you

You came along
From far away
And found me here

I was playing around
Feeling down
Hitting the beer
You picked me up
From off the floor
And gave me a smile
You said
You're much too young
Your life ain't begun
Let's walk for awhile

And as my head was spinning 'round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, ooh
I want you

Thank you, babe
For being a friend
And shining your light in my life
'Cause, ooh
I need you

As my head was coming round
I gazed into your eyes
And thought, ooh
I want you

Thanks again for being my friend
And straightening out my life
'Cause, ooh
I need you

It would have to be me

People say I'm crazy doing what I'm doing
Well they give me all kinds of warnings to save me from ruin
When I say that I'm okay well they look at me kind of strange
Surely you're not happy now you no longer play the game
People say I'm lazy dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice designed to enlighten me
When I tell 'em that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
Don't you miss the big time boy? You're no longer on the ball

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round

Well I tell them there's no problem
Only solutions
Well they shake their heads and they look at me
As if I've lost my mind
I tell them there's no hurry
I'm just sitting here doing time

And if we're victims of the night
I won't be blinded by the light

Stretchin' and yawnin', another day ahead
It seems to last forever and time goes slowly by
Till babe and me's together, then it starts to fly

The moment that he's with me, everything's alright
Night time is the right time, we make love
Then it's his and my time, we take off

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

He takes me to a movie or to a restaurant
To go slow dancing, anything I want
Only when he's with me, I catch light
Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him
All day I think of him, dreamin' of him constantly
I'm crazy mad for him and he's crazy mad for me (crazy mad for me)
When he steps off that train, amazingly full of fight
Work all day to earn his pay, so we can play all night

My baby takes the morning train
He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again
To find me waitin' for him

126,1981,Elton John,Nobody Wins,"[Verse 1]
They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Verse 2]
They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears
[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

[Verse 3]
We used to love each other once
With all the passion we possessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we learn from what we see
And face the truth while we still can
Then though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on

[Chorus]
And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins

Nobody wins, nobody wins
La-la-la-la, la-la, la-la
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins
(Nobody wins) Nobody wins

128,1981,Santana,Winning,"[Verse 1]
One day I was on the ground
When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be found
I was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
Lost before I'd begun

[Chorus 1]
I had a dream
But it turned to dust
What I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turn around
Fate must have woke her
Because lady luck she was
Waiting outside the door
[Chorus 2]
I'm winning[x5]
And I don't intend on losing again

[Verse 2]
Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And I meant to be
It took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day
That I breath for
Friends agree there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

And bring me the dream of a lifetime

Well I just can't hide the truth no more
I've got to get my feet back down on the floor
I love you so
I need you so
I just don't think I can let you go

Won't ya say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun shines
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

Well, it's you that keeps me feeling this way
I don't think I can take it even one more day
It don't seem right
That I should be alone tonight

Say you'll be mine
Say you'll be mine until the sun will shine
Say you'll be mine
And bring me the dream of a lifetime

130,1981,Daryl Hall John Oates,Kiss On My List,"[Verse 1]
My friends wonder why I call you all the time, what can I say?
I don't feel the need to give such secrets away
You think maybe I need help, though I know I'm right, all right
I'm just better off not listening to friends' advice

[Pre-Chorus]
When they insist on knowing my bliss
I tell them this
When they want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I tell them why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Verse 2]
I go crazy wondering what there is to really see
Did the night just take up your time, 'cause it means more to me
Sometimes I forget what I'm doing, I don't forget what I want, I want
Regret what I've done, regret you? I couldn't go on
[Pre-Chorus]
But if you insist on knowing my bliss
I'll tell you this
If you want to know what the reason is
I only smile when I lie, then I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light

[Bridge]
I really miss you, babe

[Chorus]
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Oh babe, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is what I miss when I turn out the light
Because your kiss, your kiss is on my list
Because your kiss, your kiss I can't resist
Because your kiss is on my list of the best things in life
Ohh, because your kiss, your kiss is on my list..."

There's a silver moon in the midnight sky
And lovers are heart to heart
But love is a shadow
Lost in your eyes
And time has taken us apart
But it's so far away and so long ago
It's still so strong I want you to know

[Chorus:]
You're still right here in my heart
Where you've been right from the start
Still right here in my heart oh baby

There's a hollow sound in this empty room
Echoes in the dark
I wish I could wake and find you here
Give us another chance to start
But night after night day after day
I love you so much I still have to say

[Chorus]
Well I wonder what you're feelin
Do you ever feel the same
When you listen to your heart
Do you ever hear my name

I seem to find love where I ramble
And when it's time to go
I hear that voice again, saying

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart

Leave a message with the rain
You can find me where the wind blows
The snow across the pain
And the frost upon the heart

(You got no place to be
Still you wonder where you're going)
And why I had to leave
I hear a voice, it says to me

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
To her heart
C'mon
I know it's too late now
But, I wish I could go back in time
And start all over somehow
And get it right from the start

Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart
Find your way back
Find your way back to her heart

Find your way back (find your way back)

You better you better you bet, ooh

[Verse 1]
I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex (Hmmmm)
To the sound of old T-Rex (oh)  – and Who's Next

I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose

I know only fools have needs but this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh, a little is alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight

We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying ""you better""
You better bet your life
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me, all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

[Verse 3]
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier (oooh ooh)
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime (oooh ooh)
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free

When I say I need you you say you better

She's a modern girl who's been though this movie before

Chorus:
She don't build her world 'round no single man

She is free to be, what she wants to be

It looks like rain again, she takes a train again
She's on her way again through London town
Where she keeps a tangerine, flicks through a magazine
Until it's time to leave her dreams on the underground
She walks to the office like everyone else
An independent lady, takin' care of herself

Chorus

She's been dreaming 'bout it all day long
As soon as she gets home, it's him on the telephone
He asks her to dinner, she says I'm not free
Tonight I'm going to stay at home and watch my TV
I don't build my world 'round no single man
But I'm gettin' by, doin' what I can
I am free to be, what I want to be
'N all what I want to be, is a modern girl

Your place is furnished like the President's suite
Your freezer's filled up with the finest of meat

They say you like to feel white gold on your neck
They say when you make love you like to direct
And that new sports car you proceeded to wreck
They say I ought to ask who picked up the check
I can take care of myself
My friends all say I ought to think twice
I can take care of myself
I don't need nobody's advice
You're so nice
Attempts to charm you met with little success
I never met someone so hard to impress
Until one day by chance you saw my address
The next day you had on your lowest cut dress

They could be correct in their judgment of you
Maybe you'll take me and make me a fool
But I'm a big boy and I know what to do
It might be worth it to wake up next to you

You've gone and left behind the feelin' we'd found
Too much too soon too much too soon

You act like you were just born tonight
Face down in a memory but feeling all right
So who does your past belong to today?
Baby, you don't say nothing when you're feeling this way
The girls in the bars thinking, ""who is this guy?""
But they don't think nothing when they're telling you lies
You look so careless when they're shooting that bull
Don't you know heartaches are heroes when their pockets are full?

[Chorus]
Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room?""
The girls say, ""God, I hope he comes back soon""

[Verse 2]
Everybody's talking, but you don't hear a thing
You're still uptown on your downhill swing
Boulevard's empty, why don't you come around?
Baby, what is so great about sleeping downtown?
There's plenty of dives to be someone you're not
You say you're looking for something you might've forgot
Don't bother calling to say you're leaving alone
'Cause there's a fool on every corner when you're trying to get home

Tell me you're trying to cure a seven-year ache
See what else your old heart can take
The boys say, ""when is he gonna give us some room?""

And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything the same?
Do you ever think of me and how we loved one another?
Will you change your mind?
Will you want me back again or have you found yourself a new lover?

Hearts can break
And never mend together
Love can fade away
Hearts can cry
When love won't stay forever
Hearts can be that way

Is everything okay?
I just thought I'd write a song to tell the world how I miss you
'Cause each and every day
I think of all the words I never said and all the chances that I had to

Have gone so empty

Will I ever find the love
We shared together, you and I

Such a long hard road
To climb, sweet baby

I'll try moon gazer

Let it steal my heart away

Outside, they're ringing
The night train is bringin' me home

Have you heard?
If you're in the game
Then the stroke's the word
Don't take no rhythm
Don't take no style
Got a thirst for killing
Grab your vial

You put your right hand out
Give a firm handshake
Talk to me
About the one big break
Spread the ear pollution both far and wide
Keep your contributions by your side and stroke me, stroke me

[Chorus]
Stroke me, stroke me
Could be a winner, boy, you move quite well
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
You got your number down
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now
[Verse 3]
You put your left foot out
Keep it all in place
Work your way
Right into my case
First you try to bed me
You make my backbone slide
But when you find you bled me
Step on by
Keep on

[Chorus]
Stroke me, stroke me
Give me the business all night long
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
You're so together, boy
Stroke me, stroke me
Say you're a winner but man you're just a sinner now

[Verse 4]
Better listen now
Said it ain't no joke
Let your conscience fail you
Just do the stroke
Don't you take no chances
Keep your eye on top
Do your fancy dances
You can't stop, you just
[Chorus]
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Do it
Stroke me, stroke me
Stroke me, stroke me
Keep on

Sometimes I can't help the feeling that I'm
Living a life of illusion
And oh, why can't we let it be
And see through the hole in this wall of confusion
I just can't help the feeling I'm
Living a life of illusion

[Verse 2]
Pow! Right between the eyes
Oh, how nature loves her little surprises
Wow! It all seems so logical now
It's just one of her better disguises
And it comes with no warning
Nature loves her little surprises
Continual crisis

[Verse 3]
Hey, don't you know it's a waste of your day
Caught up in endless solutions
That have no meaning, just another hunch
Based upon jumping conclusions
Caught up in endless solutions
Backed up against a wall of confusion
Living a life of illusion"

Get on the bus, pay your fare
Then tell the driver that you're going to a Double Dutch Affair

You got a special man? Well, I can understand
Uptown, downtown everybody's getting down

Well, I missed my bus I know I'm late

Go ahead and laugh that's okay

In the cool of the night
When nothing seems right
The feeling can take you
Strange as it seems
You make your own dreams come true

If you try to conceal
The way that you feel
You're asking for trouble
Just as sure as I cry
I'm keeping my eye on you

What cha' gonna do for me
What cha' gonna do for me

We had broken up for good just an hour before
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing 'cross the floor
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the band slowed the tempo and the music took me down
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
It was the same old song, with a melancholy sound
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

[Chorus]
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

[Verse 2]
We'd been living together for a million years
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
But now it feels so strange out in the atmospheres
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And then the jukebox plays a song I used to know
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
And now I'm staring at the bodies as they're dancing so slow
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

[Chorus]
They don't write 'em like that anymore
They don't write 'em like that anymore
Oh
[Verse 3]
Hey
Now I wind up staring at an empty glass
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
'Cause it's so easy to say that you'll forget your past
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah

They don't write 'em like that anymore, no
They just don't write 'em like that anymore

169,1981,Jim Steinman,Rock And Roll Dreams Come Through,"[Verse: Jim Steinman]
You can't run away forever
But there's nothing wrong with getting a good head start
You want to shut out the night, you want to shut down the sun
You want to shut away the pieces of a broken heart

Think of how we'd lay down together
We'd be listening to the radio so loud and so strong
Every golden nugget coming like a gift of the gods
Someone must have blessed us when he gave us those songs

I treasure your love
I never want to lose it
You've been through the fires of hell
And I know you've got the ashes to prove it
I treasure your love
I want to show you how to use it
You've been through a lot of pain in the dirt
And I know you've got the scars to prove it

Remember everything that I told you
And I'm telling you again that it's true
When you're alone and afraid and you're completely amazed
To find there's nothing anybody can do

[Chorus: Jim Steinman]
Keep on believing
And you'll discover baby:
There's always something magic
There's always something new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
The beat is yours forever
The beat is always new
And when you really
Really need it the most
That's when rock and roll dreams come through
For you"

Get Wet
Lonely, just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
Just so lonely
Just for you
It wasn't what I wanted
And I do know right from wrong
I wasn't out to prove or doubt
That we've got something strong
It was one less hour of sitting alone
Like last year's favorite doll
Runnin' my fingers across the phone
Hopin' that you might call
The girl was just so lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
I wasn't out to hurt you
Wasn't sure you'd even care
When I turned the key I knew it had to be
Cause I really needed someone there
I needed the heat from a young man's lips
To break the darkness of my room
But his kisses weren't sweet enough
To make that hour bloom
For the girl who's lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
Just so lonely
Just so lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely just for you
But when I closed my eyes I knew
Nobody else's arms would ever do
So I sent him home and got oh so lonely
(Lonely just for you)
So lonely
(Lonely just for you)
So lonely
(Lonely just for you)
Lonely just for you"
171,1981,Anne Murray,Blessed Are The Believers,"Rain in the sky
A tear in my eye
Static on the radio
The long night's begun
With dinner for one
You said you'd never go

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak

Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again

Cold coffee cup
Sun coming up
Sleep is a distant dream
Something you said
Rolls round in my head
Something that you didn't mean

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak
Blessed are all the left-behind
For their hearts shall one day mend
When loving those same sweet lies
Make us believers again

Blessed are the believers
They shall inherit a heartache
Believing in you, babe
That was my greatest heartbreak"
172,1981,The Pointer Sisters,Slow Hand,"[Verse 1]
As the midnight moon was driftin' through
The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eyes, looking into mine
Seeing what you wanted to see
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
I'm tired of fast moves, I've got a slow groove
On my mind

[Chorus]
I want a man with a slow hand
I want a lover with an easy touch
I want somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I want somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
On shadowed ground, with no one around
And a blanket of stars in our eyes
We are driftin' free, like two lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the night
Darlin', don't say a word, 'cause I already heard
What your body's sayin' to mine
If I want it all night, you say it's alright
Ooh, we got the time
[Chorus]
'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I got a lover with an easy touch
I've got somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
When it comes to love, I want a slow hand
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
If I want it all night
Please say it's alright
It's not a fast move
But a slow groove
On my mind

'Cause I got a man with a slow hand
I've got a lover with an easy touch
I found somebody who will spend some time
Not come and go in a heated rush
I found somebody who will understand
I found a lover with a slow hand
Ooh, a lover with a slow hand

[Outro]
And I get all excited with his easy touch
I found somebody who will spend the night
Not come and go in a heated rush
Ooh, lover with a slow hand"

Stormy days and the leaves keep on falling
I don't like the town when the Autumn has come
Clouds are grey and there's fog outside

Feeling down when the Winter has come
Frozen feet and the snowflakes are falling
I don't like the town when the Winter has come
Dirty streets and it's cold outside
I don't care for a riding sleigh -
Get your share from the rain in May

Rain in May, wipes your worries away
Take a dose, take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

Feeling down when the Summer has come
Burning heat, drops of sweat keep on falling
I don't like the town when the Summer has come
Dusty streets and it's hot outside
I don't care for a sunny day -
Get your share from the rain in May

Rain in May, wipes your worries away
Take a dose take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May
Rain in May wipes your worrying away
Take a dose take off your clothes
Feel the soft warm spray of the rain in May

Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
Its now or never; My love won't wait
When I first saw you with your smile so tender
My heart was captured; My soul surrendered
I've spent a life time waiting for the right time
Now that you're near the time is here at last
It's now or never; Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darlin; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never; My love won't wait
Just like a willow we could cry an ocean
If we lost true love and sweet devotion
Your lips excite me; Let your arms invite me
For who knows when we'll meet again this way
It's now or never; Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling; be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never; My love won't wait"

Jump on back, he's good and long

Runnin' seems like the best defense

I knew that it was time
To let you know how I feel
When you kissed me by surprise
I got buterflies
Swiming around in my soul out of control
The kiss was so warm and so pure

A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride

Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift

Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you

No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is

And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

And the energy you trade
He gets right on to
The friction of the day"

'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

Whisper to me softly
Breathe words upon my skin
No one's near and listening
So please don't say goodbye

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Press your lips to mine
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

Lying here beside you
I hear the echoes of your sighs
Promise me you'll stay with me
And keep me warm tonight

[Chorus]
Just hold me close and love me
Give my heart a smile
Mmm, feels so right, feels so right

Your body feels so gentle
And my passion rises high
You're loving me so easy
Your wish is my command

Tell me it won't end

Feels so right

Oh how you feel so right baby"
187,1981,T.G. Sheppard,I Loved 'em Every One,"I've known some painted ladies that sparkled in the light
Country girls that loved the lovers moon
Some I never really knew, though I always wanted to
Some I only met once in a room

Some said they liked my smile, others of 'em stayed a while
While others left me on the run
This is the only way, only way I have to say
I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms
And I hope they had some fun

Here's to the ladies in saloons and living rooms
Summer nights that lasted until dawn
Here's to the memories, everyone's a part of me
Oh, I loved 'em every one

Big, little or short or tall, wish I could've kept them all
I loved 'em every one
Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms

Like to thank 'em for their charms, holdin' me in their arms
And I hope they had some fun"

Make that move right now, baby
So many times
By holding back I let the good things pass me by

Toe to toe, dancing very close
Barely breathing, almost comatose
Wall to wall, people hypnotized
And they're stepping lightly
Hang each night in rapture

[Verse 2]
Back to back, sacroiliac
Spineless movement and a wild attack
Face to face, sightless solitude
And it's finger popping
24-hour shopping in rapture

[Rap 1]
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly
DJ spinnin' I said, ""My My""
Flash is fast, Flash is cool
France Soir c'est pas Flash et Nous Deux
François c'est pas, Flash ain't no dude
And you don't stop, sure shot
Go out to the parking lot
And you get in your car and drive real far
And you drive all night and then you see a light
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground
And out comes a man from Mars
And you try to run but he's got a gun
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head
And then you're in the man from Mars
You go out at night eatin' cars
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too
Mercurys and Subaru
And you don't stop, you keep on eatin' cars
Then, when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet
Face to face, dance cheek to cheek
One to one, man to man
Dance toe to toe, don't move too slow
'Cause the man from Mars is through with cars
He's eatin' bars, yeah wall to wall
Door to door, hall to hall
He's gonna eat 'em all
Rap-ture, be pure
Take a tour through the sewer
Don't strain your brain, paint a train
You'll be singin' in the rain
Said don't stop to punk rock
[Verse 3]
Man to man, body muscular
Seismic decibel, bite the jugular
Wall to wall, tea time technology
And a digital ladder
No sign of bad luck in rapture

[Rap 2]
Well now you see what you wanna be
Just have your party on TV
'Cause the man from Mars
Won't eat up bars where the TV's on
Now he's gone back up to space
Where he won't have a hassle with the human race
And you hip-hop, and you don't stop
Just blast off, sure shot
'Cause the man from Mars stopped eatin' cars
And eatin' bars and now he only eats guitars, get up"
193,1981,The Rovers,Wasn't That A Party,"Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party

Someone took a grapefruit
Wore it like a hat
I saw someone under my kitchen table
Talking to my old tom cat
They were talking about hockey
The cat was talking back
Along about then everything went black
Wasn't that a party

I'm sure it's just my memory
Playing tricks on me
But I think I saw my buddy
Cutting down my neighbour's tree

Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die
Tell me, me-oh, me-oh-my
Wasn't that a party
Billy, Joe and Tommy
Well, they went a little far
They were sitting in my backyard
Blowing on a sireen from somebody's police car

So you see, Your Honour
It was all in fun
That little bitty track meet down on main street
Was just to see if the cops could run
Well, they run us in to see you
In an alcoholic haze
I sure can use those thirty days
To recover from the party

Could have been the whiskey
Might have been the gin
Could have been the three or four six-packs
I don't know, but look at the mess I'm in
My head's like a football
I think I'm going to die

194,1981,Sister Sledge,Next Time You'll Know,"[Verse 1:]
Looks like we're running out of time
Can't hide away
In nights
No longer yours or mine

All things must change
It's so painful
When nothing ever stays the same
But I must go on
While you run away from love, oh

[Chorus:]
Next time you'll know
Not to let my love go
When you feel afraid
And you can't love nobody

Next time you'll know
You must let your heart show
Till the dying day
My friend

[Verse 2:]
Maybe I hurt too easily
But is it wrong to
Feel betrayed when love can't be?
You could change your mind
No excuses could ever
Make me change mine
But I've got to be strong
And believe I'll find the love
Oh

[Repeat Chorus:]

Oh
Believe it

195,1981,Helen Reddy,I Can't Say Goodbye To You,"You say it would be better
If we stopped seeing each other
If you had only met me first
When you were free

'Cause now you've got commitment
I should not expect things from you
That you can't give to me
Oh, but baby can't you see?

I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye

Neither of us planned
That we would fall in love this way
But since we did
Why should we be apart?

Sometimes, some things happen
That can never be explained
Now, it's too late for me
I've already given you my heart
I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye

Who knows why we choose
When we choose the ones we love
Who knows why we do the things
We do when we're in love

I know that you're a decent man
And you try to do what's best
But how can I forget
All the feelings we have shared

I can't say goodbye to you
No matter how I try
You're such a part of me
Without you I would die

Deep in the heart of me
I know that you and I
Were meant to be forever
I can't tell you goodbye

I can't tell you goodbye"
196,1981,Steve Winwood,While You See A Chance,"Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

When some cold tomorrow finds you
When some sad old dream reminds you
How the endless road unwinds you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

Don't you know by now
No one gives you anything?
And don't you wonder how you keep on moving?
One more day your way, oh your way

When there's no one left to leave you
Even you don't quite believe you
That's when nothing can deceive you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you
Stand up in a clear blue morning
Until you see what can be
Alone in a cold day dawning
Are you still free? Can you be?

And that old gray wind is blowing
And there's nothing left worth knowing
And its time you should be going

While you see a chance take it
Find romance fake it
Because it's all on you

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance

While you see a chance take it
Find romance
While you see a chance take it
Find romance"

You should've seen by the look in my eyes, baby
There was something missing
You should've known by the tone of my voice, maybe
But you didn't listen
You played dead
But you never bled
Instead you lay still in the grass
All coiled up and hissing

[Verse 2]
And though I know all about those men
Still I don't remember
'Cause it was us, baby, way before them
And we're still together

I meant that I love you forever

Young teacher, the subject
Of schoolgirl fantasy
She wants him so badly
Knows what she wants to be
Inside her there's longing
This girl's an open page
Bookmarking, she's so close now
This girl is half his age

[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 2]
Her friends are so jealous
You know how bad girls get
Sometimes it's not so easy
To be the teacher's pet
Temptation, frustration
So bad it makes him cry
Wet bus stop, she's waiting
His car is warm and dry
[Chorus]
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

[Verse 3]
Loose talk in the classroom
To hurt they try and try
Strong words in the staffroom
The accusations fly
It's no use, he sees her
He starts to shake and cough
Just like the old man in
That book by Nabokov

Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me
Don't stand, don't stand so
Don't stand so close to me

And I'm wakin' up from another dream of you
Yes, you know I'm on the road once again it seems
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, I love you

And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart
But you know that I love you
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you

And if only I could find my way back to the time
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you

But you know we can't live on dreams alone
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know
But you know that I love you

Hey, lady, you, lady
Cursing at your life
You're a discontented mother
And a regimented wife
I've no doubt you dream about
The things you'll never do
But I wish someone had talked to me
Like I wanna talk of you

[Verse 2]
Ooo, I've been to Georgia
And California
And anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Verse 3]
Please lady, please, lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes
Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart
That has lived a million lives
[Verse 4]
Oh, I've been to Nice
And the isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed 'em what I've got
I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things
That a woman ain't supposed to see

[Chorus]
I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me

[Spoken Verse 5]
Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we'd like them to be
But you know what truth is?
It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you're going to make love with tonight
That's truth, that's love

[Verse 6]
Sometimes I've been to crying
For unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life I never knew
I'd be bitter from the sweet
I've spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free
[Chorus]
Hey lady, I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me
I've been to paradise
Never been to me

[Outro]
I've been to Georgia and California
And anywhere I could run
I've been to paradise
Never been to me
Been to Nice and the isle of Greece
When I've sipped champagne on a yacht
I've been to paradise
Never been to me"

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Oh, shucks

I'm just an average guy
I fooled around a little on the side
Never thought it would amount to much
Never met a girl whose love was so tough
Who'd thought a one-night stand
Would turn into such a hot romance?
Mmmm, when she did it to me
I slipped and fell in love

I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind.  Mmmm

Now I know the rules of the game
You hit it once, then break away clean
I should've never gone back, I know
But I had to have just a little bit more
My friends laugh, but that's alright
I may be a fool, but I know what I like
Now I hate to have to cheat
But it feels better when I sneak.  Ow!
I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Somebody help me
I'm in love, uh huh, (I'm in love)
With the other woman.  (With the other woman)
Hey, hey
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Mmmm, hmmm.  Whoa, oh

Oh, this affair is unique
All my life I never met such a freak
She keeps me going strong for so long
When I get home, it's all gone
Makes me wanna grab my guitar
And play with it all night long

Ow!
I'm in love (I'm in love)
With the other woman
My life was fine, (Life was fine)
Yes it was, till she blew my mind
Mmmm, tell me
Has anybody else out there ever fell in love

205,1982,The Human League,Don't You Want Me,"[Verse 1: Philip Oakey]
You were workin' as a waitress in a cocktail bar
When I met you
I picked you out, I shook you up and turned you around
Turned you into someone new
Now five years later on you've got the world at your feet
Success has been so easy for you
But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now
And I can put you back down too

[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me
It's much too late to find
You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

[Chorus: Philip]
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?
Don't you want me, baby?
Don't you want me, ohh?

[Verse 2: Susan Ann Sulley]
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar
That much is true
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place
Either with or without you
The five years we have had have been such good times
I still love you
But now I think it's time I live my life on my own
I guess it's just what I must do
[Pre-Chorus: Philip]
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me
Don't, don't you want me?
You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me

You think you've changed your mind
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry

Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have
If I made you feel second best
Girl, I'm sorry I was blind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

[Verse 2]
And maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine
Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time

And you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

207,1982,Asia,Heat Of The Moment,"[Verse 1]
I never meant to be so bad to you
One thing I said that I would never do
A look from you and I would fall from grace
And that would wipe the smile right from my face

Do you remember when we used to dance?
And incidents arose from circumstance
One thing led to another, we were young
And we would scream together songs unsung

[Chorus]
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what my heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Verse 2]
And now you find yourself in Eighty Two
The disco hot spots hold no charm for you
You can concern yourself with bigger things
You catch a pearl and ride the dragon's wings

[Chorus]
'Cause it's the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes
[Verse 3]
And when your looks are gone and you're alone
How many nights you sit beside the phone
What were the things you wanted for yourself?
Teenage ambitions you remember well

[Chorus]
It was the heat of the moment
Telling me what your heart meant
The heat of the moment showed in your eyes

[Outro]
It was the heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment showed in your eyes

Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment
Heat of the moment

212,1982,Elton John,Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny),"[Verse 1]
What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared?
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain

[Verse 2]
And what's it for? This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

[Verse 3]
And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name
[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play?""

[Chorus]
And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', ""Oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out?
Can you come out to play?""

Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?

Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?
Johnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?"
213,1982,Little River Band,Man On Your Mind,"I can feel it floating away
Inch by inch
Day by day
Love boat set itself free
Castaway, slipping out to sea

I can feel it coming adrift
Even a blind man could see the rift
From an ocean liner
To a Chinese junk
There ain't been a ship that can't be sunk

I used to dream it could last forever
But pipe dreams never come true
I'd be foolin' myself if I never
Thought something like this
Couldn't happen to you

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

You don't know
Just what you got
Till it's gone
I guess you heard that a lot
But it's true
It's not just a game
You can't change your life
By changing your name
It's not something you can hide away
Sooner or later it starts to show
It's written on your face
You've been betrayed
Do you really believe that I don't know

I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
(Goodbye)

He's already fallen
So it's no use to fight
And if he starts callin'
Let him know you're with me
For the rest of the night

Ooh, I said baby
You've got a man on your mind
(Got a man on your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

Baby
(Please listen to me baby)
You've got a man on your mind
(Gotta get that man off your mind)
You've got a weight on your shoulders
How you ever gonna find the words to say
Goodbye

And when going out is coming home
Well, you can count on the kid
'Cause there's nobody waiting around, oh, oh

If you're not an easy mark
It's a shot in the dark that hits the heart
And I know, I know, I know, I know when it's coming
I thought so anyway

Some things stay the same
And some are due for change
I thought I had them all nailed down

I know when a love is real or touch and go
And if two can be one
Who is the one two becomes, oh, oh
Am I quick enough to see
When I'm ready and it's right for me?
I say, I say, I say, I say that I want it
I think so anyway

Everybody always laughs at love
But what they want is to be proven wrong
Then you came along

Here... no more confusion
We see our lives, We live our lives
Remember when we thought we never would survive?
But now neither one of us is breaking
There's more to love, I know...than making love

Somethings never change
Somethings sometimes do

And now I'm feeling strong enough to let you in
And now neither one of us is breaking
Knowing now that there's more to love...than making love

220,1982,Dan Fogelberg,Run For The Roses,"Born in the valley
And raised in the trees
Of Western Kentucky
On wobbly knees

With mama beside you
To help you along
You'll soon be a-growin' up strong

Oh, the long lazy mornings
In pastures of green
The sun on your withers
The wind in your mane

Could never prepare you
For what lies ahead
The run for the roses so red

And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand

It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time
You joined in the dance
It's high time
You joined in the dance
From sire to sire
It's born in the blood
The fire of a mare and
The strength of a stud

It's breeding
And it's training
And it's something unknown
That drives you and carries you home

And it's run for the roses
As fast as you can
Your fate is delivered
Your moment's at hand

It's the chance of a lifetime
In a lifetime of chance
And it's high time
You joined in the dance
It's high time
You joined in the dance"
221,1982,The Charlie Daniels Band,Still In Saigon,"[Verse 1]
Got on a plane in 'Frisco
And got off in Vietnam
I walked into a different world
The past forever gone
I could have gone to Canada
Or I could have stayed in school
But I was brought up differently
I couldn't break the rules
Thirteen months and fifteen days
The last ones were the worst
One minute I'd kneel down and pray
And the next I'd stand and curse
No place to run to
Where I did not feel that war
When I got home I stayed alone
And checked behind each door

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Verse 2]
The ground at home was covered in snow
And I was covered in sweat
My younger brother calls me a killer
And my daddy calls me a vet
Everybody says I'm someone else
And I'm sick and there's no cure
Damned if I know who I am
There was only one place I was sure
[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind

[Verse 3]
Every summer when it rains
I smell the jungle, I hear the planes
I can't tell no one, I feel ashamed
Afraid some day I'll go insane
That's been ten long years ago
And time has gone on by
Now and then I catch myself
Eyes searching through the sky
All the sounds of long ago
Will be forever in my head
Mingled with the wounded cries
And the silence of the dead

[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind
[Chorus]
Because I'm still in Saigon
Still in Saigon
I am still in Saigon
In my mind"
222,1982,Aldo Nova,Fantasy,"City nights, summer breeze makes you feel all right
Neon lights shining brightly make your brain ignite
See the girls with the dresses so tight
(Give you love) Give you love if the price is right
Black or white, in the streets there's no wrong and no right, no

Outta sight, buy your kicks from the man in the white
Feels all right, powder pleasure in your nose tonight
See the men paint their faces and cry
(Like some girl) Like some girl, it makes you wonder why
City life sure is cool, but it cuts like a knife, it's your life

So forget all that you see
It's not reality
(It's just a fantasy)

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?
Life is just a fantasy, can you live this fantasy life?

So forget all that you see
It's not reality

Can't you see what this crazy life is doing to me? Yeah

""Don't let this good love slip away
Now that we know that it's true.""

And if ever comes a day
When you should turn and walk away, oh no

227,1982,Loverboy,When It's Over,"When you look into his eyes
It comes to you as no surprise
It's always the same
Every time he's out with you
He tries to tell you what to do
You don't need it that way

Sometimes you think you're playing the fool
He's running around breaking all the rules
Somehow that don't seem fair
There's got to be a better way
You know what I'm trying to say

'Cause deep, deep down inside
You're living in a life in total lies

What did he ever do for you
What's he trying to put you through
I just don't understand

You showed him love and tenderness
Touched him with your sweet caress
Now he's leaving you

So what's the point in working it out
Tell me what it's all about
That's why I'm saying
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over

You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely (you)
When it's over

It's over, it's over, it's over
It's over, it's over, it's over

And in the morning when he's gone
Please don't sing that sad, sad song
I don't want to hear it

Forget about him
Let him go
It won't hurt what he don't know

What's he trying to say to you
What's he trying to tell you
He don't really care

Face the truth and realize
You don't need his alibis
No more
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over
I hope you're with me
I hope you're with me when it's over

You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over
You won't be lonely
You won't be lonely when it's over

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night

[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

[Verse 2]
Now, I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
[Chorus]
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now, I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh, tainted love
Tainted love

[Outro]
Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you, though you hurt me so
Now, I'm gonna pack my things and go

Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love, oh
Tainted love, oh

229,1982,Sheena Easton,When He Shines,"This mans a child, this man is old
Sometimes hes mild, sometimes hes bold
This man I love, sometimes in spite
I wish he would stick to his guns, or abandon the fight

But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright

Sometimes a tramp, sometimes a dude
He changes colour just like a cameleon, can't find the mood
He is a song thats not easy to write
He is a moon in the morning, and the sun out at night

But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright

This mans a gentleman, this man is strong
This temperamental man plays me along

But when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright
Yes when he shines, when he shines, oh when he shines, he shines so bright

(Instrumental break)

But when he shines, oh when he shines
Yes when he shines, he shines so bright"
230,1982,Ronnie Milsap,Any Day Now,"Any day now
I will hear you say
Good bye, my love
And you'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird, you will have flown
Any day now, I'll be all alone

Any day now
When your restless eyes meets someone new
Oh, to my sad surprise
Then blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now, love will let me down

I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay
Until you're gone forever
I'll keep holding on for dear life

Holding you this way
Begging you to stay
Any day now, when the clock strikes go
You'll call it off
Then my tears will flow

Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown
Any day now, love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Oh, then the blue shadows will fall all over town
Any day now
Love will let me down
Cause you won't be around
Any day now
You won't be around
No, no, no, no, no, no, you won't be around"
231,1982,Kansas,Play The Game Tonight,"You think that something's happening
And it's bigger than your life
But it's only what you're hearing
Will you still remember
When the morning light has come
Will the songs be playing over and over
Till you do it all over again

Play, play the game tonight
Can you tell me if it's wrong or right
It is worth the time, is it worth the price
Do you see yourself in a white spotlight
Then play the game tonight

And when the curtains open
To the roaring of the crowd
You will feel it all around you
Then it finally happens
And it's all come true for you
And the songs are playing over and over
Till you do it over again"

Fly away with me tonight
Take me on a one-way flight in your loving arms
And everything's going to be alright

When no one else could understand
You're the one who moves me
Like nobody else can

[Chorus]
Take me down where I want to be
Turn around, this man who lives inside of me
Take me down and love me all night long
Hold me close and make me strong
Take me down, take me down tonight

[Verse 2]
In your eyes I see a light
It's your emotions glowing bright
So keep the fires burning
And let it warm me through the night
You can be a part of me
'Cause you're what love was meant to be
You and me, baby
We'll set this flame inside free
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You don't have to stay forever
Let's just put our hearts together
Share another night in ecstasy
We know that it's feeling better
Every time we get together
Maybe love was meant for you and me

233,1982,The Motels,Only The Lonely,"We walked the loneliest mile
We smiled without any style
We kiss altogether wrong
No intention

We lied about each other's drinks
We lived without each other thinking
What anyone would do
Without me and you

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play

So hold on, here we go
Hold on to nothing we know
I feel so lonely
Way up here

You mention the time we were together
So long ago
Well, I don't remember
All I know is that it makes me feel good now

It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play"

Made myself a prisoner
I locked myself away
Can't remember the last time
I saw the light of day
Don't want to face life
Feel I've been betrayed
I want you tell me
Where our love went astray

[Pre-Chorus]
So can't you wait one more minute
Why can't you wait one more day
Let's get it straight
Because it's a big mistake
We better think about it

[Chorus 1]
I don't want to break it up
Why do we have to break it up?
Never ever want to break it up oh no
I only want to make it up tonight

[Verse 2]
You say you've thought about it
But you sound so cold
You make it look like our love
Can be bought or sold
You won't listen
You say it's way too late
That something is missing
And now you just can't wait
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
So don't say break it up, break it up
I want to hear you say we'll make it up, make it up
I don't want to break it up
Oh baby, why can't we make it up tonight?
Make it up tonight, make it up tonight

[Verse 3]
And I ask myself
What's wrong with me?
How could I be so blind?
I know she tried to give me everything
But I still couldn't see
Now as I watch our love slip away
I'm begging you, begging you, please

For things I left behind
With the years we spent together
There's no telling what I'll find
Its not the keys or the records
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I had it
I was walking out your door

And I came by to get some things
I used to call my own
I didn't think that I'd need them
When I started out alone
It's not the books or the records
But my heart I'm looking for
'Cause the last time that I felt it
I was walking out your door

But I don't know where to start
Looking for the lonely heart
Oh I could tear this place apart if you won't mind it
On a shelf behind the book
In the closet on a hook
If you'd only help me look I know I'll find it

I stopped in to tell you
That there isn't any doubt
That the things I left here with you
Are the things I can't live without
You can keep all that I have ever owned
It's the love I'm looking for
'Cause the the last time I felt it
I was walking out your door
But I don't know where to start

Is hard to take

From everything that I feel inside

Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell

Another dark and empty night
If I was wrong I wanna make it right
But you are so distant, so far away
Your words like ice fall on the ground
Breaking the silence without a sound

Oh familiar strangers with nothing to say
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well
Stone cold
Can't break away from your spell

You leave me stone cold
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night

Stone cold
And I thought I knew you so well

I know the women round here recognize something good
Even try to take it if they could
So I'm using every little trick I know
Making sure that he won't go

All you girls you better keep your distance
We don't need no more of your assistance

Steaming up the night
Always makes me realize

247,1982,Bertie Higgins,Just Another Day In Paradise,"[Verse 1]
The big cold city
Was such a lonely place to be
Hustle all day
And dream of the islands and sea

[Bridge 1]
Millions of girls but none of them seemed right for me
'Till you came along and you touched me
And set me free

[Verse 2]
So we slipped away last night
Eased on down to the Cay
Flying so high we hitched a ride on a Gulf Stream breeze

[Bridge 2]
Living on love and the fruits from tropical trees
With a song in our hearts and our eyes on the West Indies

[Chorus]
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise
[Verse 3]
A bottle of rum
Listening to the steel drum band
Laughing in the moonlight
Along the beach we ran

[Bridge 3]
Splashing naked in the sea making love upon the sand
Falling fast asleep like children hand in hand

[Chorus]
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

[Verse 4]
I woke up this morning
With the sunlight in my eyes
Guess it was only a dream
I hear the city outside

[Bridge 4]
But I look at you sleeping
And honey now I realize
That anywhere with you
Is paradise
[Chorus]
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

[Chorus]
It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look in your eyes
It's just another day in paradise

It's just another day in paradise
Loving the night away 'till the sunrise
Seeing that ""I love you"" look [fade]"

Jesse rides through the night
Under the Main Street light
Riding slow
This old town, ain't the same
Now nobody knows his name
Times have changed, still he rides

Traffic lights, keeping time
Leading the wild and restless
Through the night

[Chorus]
Still they ride, on wheels of fire
They rule the night
Still they ride, the strong will survive
Chasing thunder

Spinning around, in a spell
It's hard to leave this carousel
Around and around
And around and around

You never wanted to know
I never wanted to be unkind
But then something kept telling me go
There was something kept telling me go

We stayed together like birds in a cage
But then one of us had to get free
But who had the heart to say goodbye
Wasn't you, so it had to be me
Wasn't you, so it had to be me

You told me to go when I wanted to stay
Making me over in every way
Telling me just what to do with my life
But oh how I wish you could be mine
Oh how I wish you would
Be mine tonight
Be mine tonight
Tonight
Be mine tonight

We never knew it for what it was worth
It was worth more than we understood
We never got past the lies and the hurt
And it hurt even when it was good
Yes it hurt even when it was good
You told me to go when I wanted to stay
Making me over in every way
Telling me just what to do with my life
But oh how I wish you could be mine
Oh how I wish you could

251,1982,The J. Geils Band,Angel In Blue,"We met in a bar
Out on Chesapeake Bay
With her white patent boots
And her blouse red lame
A table top dancer
She would smile on cue
Those lips of an angel
Angel in blue

She's been dancing for ages
Though cities of bars
She was kickin' the habit
Of scoring in cars
She'd been drained of her spirit
All caged in this zoo
A wildcat angel
Angel in blue

And as she stared out into nowhere
I thought, yes, I thought she might break down and cry
When I whispered I thought I could love her
She just said ""Baby, don't even bother to try""

And I watched as she spoke
Her words chilled my bones
All her friends did her favors
That were really just loans
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
The palest of angels
Angel in blue
And the bees they had stung her
The birds they had flown
There were guys she could number
But none she had known
And she never had dreams
So they never came true
My fade away angel
Angel in blue"

On the boulevard of broken dreams

Oh buccaneer
Can you help me put my truck in gear?
Can you take me far away from here?
Save my soul from sin?

You want to get away you've had it man
Nothing's going right
So come sit on the sands of the island

No luxuries, no no amenities
Too dull, your senses

Where can he be?
He's not with me
Where did he go?
What will I do alone?
Why did he run, run away from me?

The sky is blue the sea is warm and clear
And golden sands are calling out to you inviting

Is she really going out with him
He's not her type
And doing all the things
She used to do with me
Well, I'd say something to her
But I get so jealous
When I think of her loving someone else
And I can't think why we ever let go
We must have been crazy
Tell me what kind of fool am I
To just let go,To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I, To lose you
She was cold sometimes
But she made me feel alive
She was such a spoiled baby
But baby she could love
And she loved me like nobody
Ever will again
I thought we'd be together
When the world ran down
When the curtains fell
And the lights came up
But the gods or whatever
Make the world go 'round
Shuffled when they should've cut
Tell me
What kind of fool am I
To just let go, To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
To lose you
Did it come to easy to the two of us
Did we go to wrong to ever make it right
Were we too busy checking out the left hand
That we didn't see the right
Tell me
What kind of fool am I
To just let go, To just let go like that
What kind of fool am I
Oh baby please, Oh baby please come back
I meant to say in time
Baby we can work it out

How will I find what is near
Don't question I'm not alone
Somehow I'll find my way home

My sun shall rise in the east
So shall my heart be at peace
And if you're asking me when
I'll say it starts at the end

Is matched with love secretly
And talk will alter your prayer
Somehow you'll find you are there

Your friend is close by your side
And speaks in far ancient tongue
A season's wish will come true
All seasons begin with you

One world we melt into one

I've got what boys like
I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I see them looking
I make them want me
I like to tease them
They want to touch me
I never let them

I know what boys like
I know what guys want

Boys like, boys like me

Mmm, would you like that
I might let you

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
I know what's on their minds
I know what boys like

They talk about me
I got my cat moves
That so upset them
Zippers and buttons
Fun to frustrate them
They get so angry
Like pouty children
Denied their candy
I laugh right at them

I know what boys like
I know what guys want
I know what boys like
Boys like, boys like me

I will let you
Sorry I teased you

This time I mean it
I will let you
Anything you want
You can trust me
I really want to
You can trust me
How would you like it
You can trust me

Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down

Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind

Where...when you're on the low
No one wants to chit or chat or even know your name
Your agent's never there
Your manager has ripped you off and gone somewhere

Everyone you meet they wanna be your long lost friend
They say how great you are, a superstar
But do you have any money to lend
(Hey, man, can you loan me a few bucks?)
When you're on the low
Where do all the freaks and fancy people go?

People sit and stare
Asking crazy questions: ""Do you braid your hair?"" and ""What's L-7 Square?""

If this thing we got together is real

You're a man now
And you know how to feel

And the answer will be such a very simple thing

But if the love fits
Wear it, baby
And if it feels good
Put it on

You'd be better off to leave it alone

But if the love fits
Wear it, baby

Put it on

And if it looks right
Then just maybe
This love we have is where you belong
Baby, you've got nothing to lose
You can try it on
And see if it suits you

And maybe if it's not right for you
You can turn
And walk away if you choose to
I want you to stay
'Cause you feel good to me
But I'll leave it up to you

But if the love fits
Wear it, baby

This love we have is where you belong
I'd like to hold you
For I love you a lot
And try to make you understand

We got a good thing
And it fits us so tight

You know everything is changin’, baby, overnight
You gotta hold on to love but not too tight
You gotta see it, see it’s not so long but alright

Give me the right kind of love, baby
Give me the right kind of love
Give me the right kind of love
And I’ll be yours tonight

Scorin' like a bandit 'til the bubble burst

Save my soul, the board of education took away my parole

I'm gonna be there 'til then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Woah, woah, I gotta go back to school again

Geometry and history is just a pain
Biology and chemistry destroys my brain
Well, don't they know that I deserve a better fate?
I'm really much too young to matriculate
Well mama please, your child's come down with a fatal disease
Mama said, ""Come on you lazy bum now get your butt out of bed!""
""You gotta go back, back, back to school again!""
It's bye-bye fun, get your homework done
You better be in by ten
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
Woah, woah, I gotta go back to school again

I got my books together and I dragged my feet
Then I saw this angel boppin' down the street
I said, ""Hey, pretty baby, how about a date?""
She said, ""I'm going to school, and I can't be late""

[Chorus]
Well, I can see, that look in her eyes was sayin', ""Follow me,""
And I was caught
I thought of playing hooky, but on second thought
I gotta go back, back, back to school again
You won't find me 'til the clock strikes three
I'm gonna be there 'til then
I gotta go back, back, back to school again

And I said here I go
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love

I'd seen so much deceivin'
I almost stopped believin'
I'd ever fall in love again
I was runnin' around hidin' my heart
Fakin' it with all of my friends
I was down on my luck
That's when you came along
You put me back on my feet
You got me singin' this song

I found somebody
I found somebody to love
I found somebody
I found somebody to love
And she loves me in the midnight hour
You know ever since I found you
And put my arms around you
I don't need a doggone thing
You know that ev'ry day is such a beautiful day
I want the whole world to dance and sing
So don't you dare hang your head
Don't you dare be blue
If it can happen to me
It can happen to you

And you'll be singin' this song

I found somebody

If it ain't one thing it's another

It's a crazy mixed up world, it's a dog eat dog world
Life is full strife, people just aren't nice
Everybody's talking smack, Running games on this and that
Racial resentment adds to this contentment
Talk to any guy he'll tell you taxes are too high
Books movies are corrupt, suicide is way up
Kids are a sorry lot, some folks say it's kind of pot
Phony ego trips, everyone has flipped

If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another

Everybody's shacking up, married folks are packing up
Country's going up in smoke, Where is Noah with his boat
Blacks marching on dc, 400 years still not free
Martin paid all a man can pay, still he's not a holiday
Folks messing with my mind, make me Frankenstein
This woman by my side, she's Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde
Can't get my head on right, problems day and night
Try to calm my nerves I've tried smoke, Doctors give me dope to cope

If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another

I've put up with a lot of crap I don't like
And to add to my woes, this ugly woman named Sadie called and said she's having my baby
Go have mercy

From my day of birth I've called hell on earth

If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another
If it ain't one thing it's another

My friends, I wonder if it's ok if I talk to you this evening
A long time ago my old grandmother bless her heart
Used to sit me on her knee and pull out her Good Book
And she said my son, my child, don't you ever get to grown, to famous, to rich to forget the man upstairs
And she used to turn to Matthew chapter 24, and there the disciples would talking to the master
And they said Lord tell us what will be the sign of your coming
And the end to all this confusion on Earth
And the Good Lord said, my children watch out that nobody deceive you
For the last days, there'll be lots of tribulation, wars, and famines
And earthquakes on different places on the Earth
And there will be no understanding among the people of the Earth
He said but as you see these things occurring
Don't become too discouraged, just lift yours head up high
Because your deliverance is getting nearer
And he spoke about the proclamation about coming kingdom or government of god
That will eventually take over this Earth and rule over the whole Earth
And turning to Daniel chapter two
And there Daniel describes that this kingdom won't be an earthly kingdom
But it will be ruled by God
Note in the book of Revelations it talks
About how there will be a man who'll be Jesus
And whose faithful 144, 000 who would bring all of mankind back to perfection
Aw, somebody out there knows exactly what I'm talking about
Isaiah, Isaiah, a long time ago said I see old people growing young again
I see lame people running and leaping just like a gazelle
And blind people will see again
And we won't have to worry about our children going out to play at night
They'll be able to play with a snake, brotherhood
There'll be brotherhood and peace and tranquility on the earth
Aw it makes me feel good when I read over in Revelations
That it say God would wipe out every tear from my eyes
Yeah that's in Revelations chapter 21
Why don't you pick up a Good Book and read all about it for yourselves
And my friends I don't know if I'll ever see you again
Life is certainly uncertain these days
I'm sure you'll agree to that
But keep dreaming the big dream
Get down on your knees and ask the big guy in the sky for his spirit to sustain you
And pray for me, I'll be praying for you"

But how I loved our secret meetings
We talked and talked in quiet voices
Smiling

[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up
My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm
Cracking up
[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation
And seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces
And now they've come to take me
Come to break me
And yet it isn't unexpected
I have been waiting for these visitors
Help me

[Chorus]
Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming, through the door I feel I'm
Cracking up
Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting
Cracking up
They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing

My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm

Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm

Voices growing louder, irritation building
And I'm close to fainting

They must know by now I'm in here trembling
In a terror ever-growing
Cracking up

My whole world is falling, going crazy
There is no escaping now, I'm

Now I hear them moving
Muffled noises coming through the door I feel I'm

Sink me in a river of tears
This could be the best place yet

Won't give me time

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations
I know will be all right
Perhaps it's just imagination

[Chorus]
And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

[Verse 2]
Alone between the sheets
Only brings exasperation
It's time to walk the streets
Smell the desperation
At least there's pretty lights
And though there's little variation
It nullifies the night
From overkill

Day after day it reappears
Night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away
Come back another day

I can't get to sleep
I think about the implications
Of diving in too deep
And possibly the complications
Especially at night
I worry over situations that
I know will be all right
It's just overkill

And day after day it reappears
And night after night my heartbeat shows the fear
Ghosts appear and fade away

Trying to live without your love, it's so hard to do

Wait and see time is all that we really need

I'm eager to please
Out of control
And I hand you the keys
Every night I am burning
To make love to you

But don't try to tell me

It goes much deeper than that

You ought to know
It's an affair of the heart

It's an affair of the heart

When we make love
It's a passionate thing
You shudder and shake
Sink your teeth in my skin
I almost believe you were made
To be played by my hands
And you got the power
It amazes me still
How you play my emotions
With consummate skill
I don't have to look any further
Than into your eyes

So don't try to tell me
You think it's just physical
It goes way deeper than that

You better know
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
It's an affair of the heart
Have a little blind faith, believe
It's an affair of the heart

I'm the controller
And I want to touch you and seize you
And make you mine, hey, hey

Don't try to tell me
You think it's all physical
It goes much deeper than that

314,1983,Sergio Mendes,Never Gonna Let You Go,"I was as wrong as I could be
To let you get away from me
I'll regret that move for as long as I'm living
But now that I've come to see the light

All I wanna do is make things right
So just say the word
And tell me that I'm forgiven

You and me
We're gonna be better than we were before
I loved you then
But now I intend to open up
And love you even more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on
We're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go
Looking back now
It seems so clear
I had it all when you were here
Oh, you gave it all
And I took it for granted

But if there's some feeling left in you
Some flicker of love
That still shines through
Let's talk it out
Let's talk about second chances

Wait and see
It's gonna be sweeter than it was before
I gave some then
But now I intend to dedicate myself to giving more
This time you can be sure

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on
We're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time

So if you'll just say
You want me too

I'm never gonna let you go
I'm gonna hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Gonna hold your body close to mine
From this day on
We're gonna be together
Oh, I swear this time
I'm never gonna let you go

Never gonna let you go
Hold you in my arms forever
Gonna try and make up for all the times
I hurt you so

Hold your body close to mine
Oh, we're gonna be together

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win?
Well look at me, I'm a-coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing
You just fade away

Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did?
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
And I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind

I'm still standing (yeah, yeah, yeah)

319,1983,Laura Branigan,Solitaire,"I still remember how much I used to need you
Tried so hard to please you, but you didn't need me
You knew I loved you, knew I always would be there
You just did what you wanted, you didn't care

All the cards were held by you
There was nothin' I could do
All those nights I sat alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' were you ever comin' home?

Solitaire, it got so lonely
Solitaire, no one to hold me
Where were you when I played solitaire?

It took some time, but I stopped thinkin' about you
Started livin' without you, now look who's back here
You've had a change of heart, well, mine just couldn't wait, no no
You found out you loved me just a little too late

Once the cards were held by you
Now there's nothin' you can do
All those nights you sit alone, starin' at the telephone
Wonderin' if I'm ever comin' home

Solitaire, see what it's like now
Solitaire, to cry all night now
Solitaire, see how it feels to bear
Solitaire, it gets so lonely
Solitaire, you wanna hold me
Don't wait up 'cause, babe, I won't be there

321,1983,The Kinks,Come Dancing,"They put a parking lot on a piece of land
Where the supermarket used to stand
Before that they put up a bowling alley
On the site that used to be the local Palais
That's where the big bands used to come and play
My sister went there on a Saturday

Come dancing
All her boyfriends used to come and call
Why not come dancing?
It's only natural

Another Saturday, another date
She would be ready but she's always make them wait
In the hallway in anticipation
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek

Come dancing
That's how they did it when I was just a kid
And when they said come dancing
My sister always did

My sister should have come in at midnight
And my mum would always sit up and wait
It always ended up in a big row
When my sister used to get home late
Out of my window I can see them in the moonlight
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate

The day they knocked down the Palais
My sister stood and cried
The day they knocked down the Palais
Part of my childhood died, just died

Now I'm grown up and playing in a band
And there's a car park where the Palais used to stand
My sister's married and she lives on an estate
Her daughters go out now it's her turn to wait
She knows they get away with things she never could
But if I asked her I wonder if she would

Come dancing
Come on sister have yourself a ball
Don't be afraid to come dancing
It's only natural

Come dancing
Just like the Palais on a Saturday
And all her friends will come dancing
Where the big bands used to play"

Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

We are fools, we make all these rules
We make it so hard to find love, to feel free, to be fresh outta school
And now, what of romance
Do we know that life is sweeter when we're taking a chance
So why do we run, and why do we cry
It's a crazy life we life, you and I

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of, oh...

Alone, out on my own
I just wander the streets and stare at the places we've known
And now, what of myself
Can I go on pretending a love for somebody else
Oh why do we play, and why do we lose
It's a dangerous life we live, we two

Carousels and wishing wells were the things we loved
Why did we play, why did we stay alone, we two
To fly away in a big balloon was what she talked of
Why did we love and leave the memory of we two
Now she is gone, I'm left to carry on"

It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy

But baby sharper than a knife
Help me to know you
Show me the night to satisfy
A sinner with the flash of an eye
There'll never be another me

I never knew love could wind me up
I don't do my stuff
""till you go walkin' by
And maybe old enough to try

I never knew anyone in between
The devil and the angel
All in one and maybe old
Enough that I can ride
Your love let me burn
Let me slide down to your soul
You can pull me in
You can push me out

But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy
But baby, stronger than the wind burn
In the fire out of the night
I'll teach you how to tremble
If you give me the night

THere'll never be enough to me
I never knew I could find the best
But searchin' out the rest there
Is no doubt and maybe we can
Sweat it out

I never knew we could find
A way this crazy situation
Over me and we forget about
The world outside

My love in your eyes
There's no world
There is no time
You can hold me in
You can throw me down

But your baby needs love
Somebody to hold
Show me what to do
The woman in you brings out
The man in me
It's the woman in you
And the finer parts of your anatomy"
327,1983,Debarge,All This Love,"[Verse 1: El DeBarge]
I had some problems
And no one could seem to solve them
But you found the answer
You told me to take this chance
And learn the ways of love, my baby
And all that it has to offer
In time you will see
That love won't let you down

You said that you loved me
Said hurt only came to pass me
It sounded so convincing
That I gave it half a chance
And learned the ways of love, my baby
There is so much love inside me
And all that I have
I give my all to you
All, all my love, baby

There's no need to wonder why
I need you, please hear me

I'm outa luck, outa love
Gotta photograph, picture of
Passion killer, you're too much
You're the only one I wanna touch
I see your face every time I dream
On every page, every magazine
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy

Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown
Oh Oh, look what you've done

Photograph - I don't want your
Photograph - I don't need your
Photograph - All I've got is a photograph
But it's not enough

I'd be your lover, if you were there
Put your hurt on me, if you dare
Such a woman, you got style
You make every man feel like a child
You got some kinda hold on me
You're all wrapped up in mystery
So wild and free so far from me
You're all I want, my fantasy
Oh, Look what you've done to this rock'n'roll clown
Oh Oh, Look what you've done

Next day you're down
She's got your head
Spinning around

That's love
It's happening all the time

You walk out the door
Head for the train
Then in a while
You're back again

That's love, you'll never change the world
Not in a million years

And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times

One gentle heart easily burned
After a lifetime
You still haven't learned
That's love, it's happening all the time
And I know that I could
Never live without you, girl
You stood by me all through the good times
And through the bad times

Young couple there
Going insane
Fussing and fighting
Then they make up again

That's love, it's happening all the time
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
No, no, no, no

You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world
You'll never change the world"
330,1983,Toto,I Won't Hold You Back,"[Verse 1]
If I had another chance tonight
I'd try to tell you that the things we had were right
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared
Now you're gone, I'm really not the same
I guess I held myself to blame
Time can erase the things we said
But it gives me time to realize that you're the one who's sad

[Chorus]
You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found
You know I can't hold you back now

[Verse 2]
Now that I'm alone it gives me time
To think about the years that you were mine
Time can erase the love we shared
But it gives me time to realize just how much you cared

You know I won't hold you back now
The love we had just can't be found - Listen to me, baby
You know I can't hold you back now
Oh

Baby Jane, don't leave me hanging on the line
I knew you when you had no one to talk to
Now you're moving in high society
Don't forget I know secrets about you
I used to think you were on my side
But now I'm no longer sure
I wish I knew what I know now before

[Chorus]
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever

[Verse 2]
Baby Jane, don't it make you feel sad
Just when I thought that we were winning
You and I were so close in every way
Don't time fly when you're loving and laughing
I've said goodbye so many times
The situation ain't all that new
Optimism's my best defense
I'll get through without you

[Chorus]
When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
I won't be that dumb again
I know it's gotta last forever
When I fall in love again
I know it's gonna last forever

[Verse 3]
Baby Jane, I've said all I want to say
Go your own way don't think twice about me
'Cause I've got ideas and plans of my own
So long darlin' I'll miss you believe me
The lesson learned was so hard to swallow
But I know that I'll survive
I'm gonna take a good look at myself and cry

When I give my heart again
I know it's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when
I know it's gonna last forever
When I fall in love next time
I know it's gonna last forever

I know it'll last forever"
332,1983,Christopher Cross,No Time For Talk,"Well I read it in town in the melancholy news
The front page story is our love is through
The hand of time is cold
I can't stand to hear the truth
Somehow I won't believe it 'til I've heard it from you

But there's no time for talk
And there's no place for tears
There's no reason to wonder after all of these years
Sure we had some good times
And so who's to blame
It's so hard to tell when you both feel the pain

After the years have come and gone
The struggle to forget you will have just begun
We had our ups and downs
But one thing's for sure
No one will ever love you more"
333,1983,INXS,The One Thing,"Well, you know just what you do to me
The way you move, soft and slippery
Cut the night just like a razor
Rarely talk, and that's the danger

It's the one thing
You are my thing

You know your voice is a love song
It's a cat call from the past
There's no ice in your lover's walk
You don't look twice, 'cause you move so fast

It's the one thing
You are my thing

[Sax solo]

You've got a dozen men behind you
You've got dead flowers on the floor
You're too pretty in the daylight
It keeps them coming back for more

It's the one thing
You are my thing
It's the one thing
You are my thing

It's the one thing
You are my thing"

335,1983,Ronnie Milsap,Stranger In My House,"[Verse 1]
There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

[Verse 2]
She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's alright
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know?
Or somebody she just met?
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed?
[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
(Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 3]
Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination?
Or has her love turned into lies?

[Chorus]
There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
A stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me
A stranger in my house"

Haven't loved you somewhere before
In another time, another place
On some distant shore?

You know me so well
Better than I know myself

And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life
All my life

And with the touch of your hand
You took me farther than I've never been
You love me like
You've loved me all my life

Love like we made
Could have taken a lifetime to find
But you found the way
To my heart in a moment of time

You know how to care
Just like you've always been there

Just like you've always been there
And you loved me tonight (tonight)
Like you loved me all my life

The closer you get, the further I fall
I'll be over the edge now in no time at all
I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall
The closer you get, the further I fall

The things that you say to me
The look on your face
Brings out the man in me
Do I see a trace in your eyes of love

I'm falling faster and faster and faster with no time to stall

Is this really real
Because there's something magic
The way that I feel in your arms tonight

338,1983,Chris de Burgh,Don't Pay The Ferryman,"It was late at night on the open road
Speeding like a man on the run
A lifetime spent preparing for the journey
He is closer now and the search is on
Reading from a map in the mind
Yes there's that ragged hill and there's a boat on the river

And when the rain came down, he heard a wild dog howl
There were voices in the night
Don't do it
Voices out of sight
Don't do it
Too many men have failed before, whatever you do

[Chorus]
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side

In the rolling mist, then he gets on board
Now there'll be no turning back
Beware that hooded old man at the rudder
And then the lightning flashed and the thunder roared
And people calling out his name
And dancing bones that jabbered-and-a-moaned on the water
And then the ferryman said There is trouble ahead
So you must pay me now
Don't do it
You must pay me now
Don't do it!
And still that voice came from beyond, whatever you do

[Chorus]
Don't pay the ferryman
Don't even fix a price
Don't pay the ferryman
Until he gets you to the other side"

It's not the way you look, it's not the way that you smile
Although there's something to them
It's not the way you have your hair, it's not that certain style
It could be that perfume

[Chorus]
If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

[Verse 2]
It's not the makeup and it's not the way that you dance
It's not the evening sky
It's more the way your eyes are laughing as they glance
Across the great divide

[Chorus]
If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing

[Bridge]
It's not the things you say, it's not the things you do
It must be something more
And if I feel this way for so long, tell me is it all for nothing
You'll still walk out the door

If I had a photograph of you
Or something to remind me
I wouldn't spend my life just wishing"

Twenty-eight years have come and gone
And she's seen a lot of tears

For little money, just tips for pay
But it's worth it all
Just to hear them say that they care

So hard for it, honey
She works hard for the money

Tried to find my mountain hideaway
Maybe next year, maybe no go

I know you're watching me
Every minute of the day, yeah
I've seen the signs
And the looks and the pictures
That give your game away, yeah

There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Please, please tell me now
Is there something I should know?
Is there something I should say
That would make you come my way?
Do you feel the same?
'Cause you don't let it show

People stare and cross the road from me
And jungle drums
They all clear the way for me
Can you read my mind?
Can you see in the snow?

And fiery demons all dance
When you walk through that door
Don't say you're easy on me
You're about as easy as a nuclear war

There's a dream that strings the road
With broken glass for us to hold
And I cut so far before I had to say

Is there something I should know?"

I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's lookin' for something
Sweet dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's lookin' for something"
346,1983,Stevie Nicks,Stand Back,"[Verse 1]
No one looked as I walked by
Just an invitation would have been just fine
Said no to him again and again
First, he took my heart, then he ran
No one knows how I feel
What I say, unless you read between my lines
One man walked away from me
First he took my hand
Take me home

[Chorus]
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la

[Verse 2]
Do not turn away my friend
Like a willow, I can bend
No man calls my name
No man came
So, I walked on down, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than you could do
One man did not call
He asked me for my love, and that was all
[Chorus]
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry

La la la la la la la la la
La la
La la la la la la la
Doo-doo, doo-doo
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la, wo-ah

[Breakdown]
So, I walked, walked down the line, away from you
Maybe your attention was more than I could do
One man did not call
Well, he asked me for my love, that was all

[Chorus]
Stand back, stand back
In the middle of my room, I did not hear from you
It's alright, it's alright
To be standing in a line (Standing in a line)
To be standing in a line
I would cry
[Outro]
Need a little, need a little sympathy
Well, I need a little sympathy (Cry)
Well, I need a little sympathy
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Take me home
Take me home (Stand back)
Won't you take me home?
Well, I need a little sympathy (Stand back)
Well, you could be standing in (Stand back)
Why don't you take me home?
Why don't you take me home? (Stand back)
Take me home (Alright)
Take me home (Alright)"

I wanna take you cool places tonight
I wanna go where nobody's a fool

I want to move like this and that
A minimum of chit chat
I never wanna cool down, cool down, cool cool cool
Cool places tonight

I gotta tell you, you're lookin' real good
They let us in so I'm feelin' all right
I like to go where sometimes they refuse
Yeah, I remember last Saturday night
But I'm feeling cooler now
And they could tell we're cooler now
It's obvious we're cooler now, cooler now, cool cool cool
Cool places tonight

I wanna go, I wanna go
I want to go to cool places tonight
I wanna go to cool places with you

And after that we'll slip out for a bite
A coffee shop, and toast, coffee and juice
And then we'll sleep 'til 5 PM
And start it up all over again
I never want to cool down, cool down, cool cool cool
I wanna go, I wanna go
I want to go to cool places tonight
I wanna go to cool places with you"
349,1983,James Ingram And Patti Austin,How Do You Keep The Music Playing,"How do you keep the music playing
How do you make it last
How do keep the song from fading
Too fast

How do you lose yourself to someone
And never lose your way
How do you not run out of new things
To say

And since you know we're always changing
How can it be the same
You're sure your heart will fall apart
Each time you hear her name

If we can be the best of lovers
Yet be the best of friends
If we can try with every day
To make it better as it goes
With any luck than I suppose
The music never ends"

353,1983,The Human League,(Keep Feeling) Fascination,"[Verse 1]
If it seems a little time is needed
Decisions to be made
The good advice of friends unheeded
The best of plans mislaid

Just looking for a new direction
In an old familiar way
The forming of a new connection
To study or to play

[Pre-Chorus]
And so the conversation turned
Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

[Chorus]
Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong
Keep feeling fascination
Looking, learning
Moving on

Well, the truth may need some rearranging
Stories to be told
And plain to see the facts are changing
No meaning left to hold

Until the sun went down
And many fantasies were learned
On that day

Keep feeling fascination
Passion burning
Love so strong

354,1983,Thompson Twins,Love On Your Side,"I hear you laughing in some other room
And it makes me feel locked out
You say my passion often stifles you
And you need to move about
But I was taught that boys need girls and girls need boys
You say that's not true
You'd rather fool around than be alone with me
Well, that's alright for you

Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side

I've bought you sentimental roses
But you gave them all away
I've played you all my favorite records
Then we spent the night in talking, talking all the time...

You sent me home
I was so surprised to find that after all
It doesn't hurt to be alone
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side

Well all the things you say make perfect sense to me
Somehow I'm still unsure
Then I catch myself going through the same old rhapsody
RAP BOY RAP!

And I don't understand just what I'm doing to myself
I guess that's nothing new
Cause when you meet someone who doesn't follow all the rules
It changes everything you do

Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side
Cause you got love, love
Love on your side"

This is how you want it to be

Oh, you're slipping away

You never talk to me the way you did before
You ride through the city with your head held high
And all I can do is watch you go by

Oh, you're slipping away
Oh, you're slipping away

I'm gonna give it all I've got to give
I've got to hold on, see what tomorrow brings

I'm lookin' back at the time that drifted by
But I won't cry for the wasted years
'Cause you ain't worth the salt in my tears

Feeling neglected, used and rejected
You need a shoulder to lean upon
Maybe you've picked him, found your next victim
Don't worry, someone will come along

I broke the spell that you kept me under
I had enough of the rain and thunder
I lost track of the time and I wonder why
But I won't cry for the wasted years

Until the memory just disappears

Of where you go
Each time you leave my door
Watching you walking down the street
Knowing there's another guy you meet
This time before you run to him
Leaving me alone again

Think it over
Haven't I been good to you babe
Think it over

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you tear it apart

I'm trying hard
Hard to be patient
Wish you'd stop
This infatuation
But each time I think of you together
I see myself losing you forever
This time before you leave my heart
And rush back into his arms
Think it over
Haven't I been good to you babe
Think it over
Haven't I been sweet to you baby

Stop in the name of love
Before you break my heart
Stop in the name of love
Before you tear it apart

Love, love never fails
Love, love never fails
Love, love never fails
Love, love never fails

There's a sky that's painted every color in the sun
And a mountain in the distance? eyes? feel as one
But they get right on a-movin'? just as?
And every man's a family man and they all realize

You can climb the mountain
You can swim the deepest sea
You can save up all your money

Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real-time world, no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On the wire between will and what will be

[Chorus 1]
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

[Verse 2]
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it, but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world, but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
[Pre-Chorus 2]
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the peak
Never stopping with her head against the wind

[Chorus 2]
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac at your door
And she's dancing like she's never danced before

I'm just a man who needed someone and somewhere to hide
To keep me alive, just keep me alive
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive

I'm alone
Sitting with my empty glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies

[Chorus]
I remember searching for the perfect words
I was hoping you might change your mind
I remember a soldier sleeping next to me
Riding on the Metro

[Verse 2]
You wore white
Smiling as you took my hand
So removed
We spoke of wintertime in France
Minutes passed with shallow words
Years have passed, and still I hurt
Oh, I can see you now
Smiling as I pulled away
[Chorus]
I remember the letter wrinkled in my hand
""I'll love you always"" filled my eyes
I remember a night we walked along the Seine
Riding on the Metro

[Chorus]
I remember a feeling coming over me
The soldier turned, then looked away
I remember hating you for loving me
Riding on the Metro

Sitting with my broken glass
My four walls
Follow me through my past
I was on a Paris train
I emerged in London rain
And you were waiting there
Swimming through apologies
Sorry

I was hoping you might change your mind

Answers gone till I don't know when

All you speak and all you hear
Hand that's strong and voice it's clear
An unforgotten memory when the moon begins to call
Called you right and called you wrong

So you're in love, I say what of it?
Things can change, there's always changes
I wanna try some rearranging, I say
Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume
Drop the mahout, I'm the easy rider
Don't use your army to fight a losing battle
Animal, mineral, physical, spiritual
I'm the one you need, I'm the one you need

You're kissing cousins, there's no smoke, no flame
If you lose that pilot I can fly your plane
If you want solid ground, come on and try me
Oh I can take you so high that you're never gonna wanna come down, I say

Drop the pilot, try my balloon
Drop the monkey, smell my perfume

All is quiet on New Year's Day
A world in white gets underway
I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day

A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few

Say it's true, it's true...
And we can break through
Though torn in two
We can be one

I, I will begin again
I, I will begin again

Maybe the time is right
Oh, maybe tonight

And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you

I put myself in danger

An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time
Dancing in the shadows
Dancing in the shadows
I saw somebody earning more and more
But he was getting poorer
It seems to me the more things that you know
The less you can be sure of
There must be someway I can try to find
An answer to the questions in my mind
Or will I have to always spend my time

Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face

So many dreams to make
And with so much love to make
I think we're gonna meet some time
Maybe all we need is time...

Must be some other way to look good in your eyes
Why am I up here? What do they see in me?
Must be one thousand other places to be

He won't be back this way till 2010

Alone in the light of the moon
A change comes over me

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire

Day after day, it’s no use
At night there’s something changed
I just gotta play it loose
Be cool, but it’s getting strange

I know it won’t be long
Before the world can see
Alone in the light of moon
My mad lycanthropy

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire
Now my friend, you know
It’s so, so hard to say
Sometimes darkness beats
Defeats the light of day

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool
It’s a fool moon fire

How can I stand this lunacy
Feeding my dark desires?
Look at the nighttime sky, you fool

Cut them like a razor
Filthy lies
Tearing them apart
So they run
Clinging to each other
Can't get too far

So wrong, so wrong
How could they be
So wrong, so wrong
How could love be so wrong

Late at night
Tryin for the border
Through the police rendezvous
Warning shots
Flyin all around

How could they be
So wrong, so wrong

[Verse 1]
New York, New York, is everything they say
And no place that I'd rather be
Where else can you do a half a million things
All at a quarter to three
When they play their music, ooh that modern music
They like it with a lot of style
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really really drives 'em wild

[Chorus]
They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating

[Verse 2]
LA, Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip
Is something everyone should see
Neon lights and the pretty pretty girls
All dressed so scantily
When they play their music, that hard rock music
They like it with a lot of flash
But it's still that same old back beat rhythm
That really kicks 'em in the....

They say the heart of rock and roll is still beating
And from what I've seen I believe 'em
Now the old boy may be barely breathing
But the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating

DC, San Antone and the Liberty Town, Boston and Baton Rouge

And in my dreams, I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

[Chorus 1]
Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

[Verse 2]
I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

[Chorus 2]
Hello, I've just got to let you know
'Cause I wonder where you are
And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

Hello, is it me you're looking for?

Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night

You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it

I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it

Just let you leave without a trace

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
‘Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Oh, there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face

Well, there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you, so many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now
Well, there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Now, take a look at me now

But to wait for you is all I can do

Yeah, you just smile and the picture sells
Look what that does to me

I'll wait till your love comes down
I'm coming straight for your heart
No way you can stop me now
As fine as you are

That meant a lot to me
I never sent it, she wouldn't have heard
Her eyes don't follow me
And while she watches, I can never be free
Such good photography

And they'll be carving you up all right

I need a love reaction
Come on now, baby, gimme just one look

Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I said to myself, ""Hold on to your heart""
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far, and it's more than I hoped for

And when I get next to your body
Just to have you near me
One thing I can tell you, perfectly clear
We're gonna have a very good time

Stay the night
I'd like to spend it with you
Stay the night

Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?
Tell me, who's that girl running around with you?

Tongue tied and twisted at the price I had to pay
Your careless notions have silenced these emotions
Look at all the foolishness your lover's talk has done

Sometimes I find you doubt my love for you
But I don't mind
Why should I mind
Why should I mind

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting

What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway
What is love anyway
Does anybody love anybody anyway

Last night was shaking and pretty loud

So give her inches and feed her well

I've got to leave, it's time for a show

Lust is in cages till storm breaks loose

He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting

I heard her cry

Feathered, look they're covered with a bright elation
Stolen, in the sight of love

Finding our way around indecision
We are, we are, we are rather helpless
Take us forever, a whisper to a scream

Birds fly, in the eye of the faithless daughter
Broken, at the bitter end
Wasted, sacrifice for a new nirvana
Night time, sends us on our way

You might think it's foolish
What you put me through (you might think)
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
All I want is you

[Bridge]
And it was hard, so hard to take
There's no escape without a scrape
But you kept it going till the sun fell down
You kept it going
[Verse 3]
Well, you might think I'm delirious the way I run you down
But somewhere sometimes, when you're curious, I'll be back around
Oh, I think that you're wild
And so uniquely styled

[Chorus]
You might think it's foolish
This chancy rendezvous
You might think I'm crazy (but all I want)
But all I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you"
441,1984,Thompson Twins,Hold Me Now,"[Verse 1]
I have a picture
Pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and
We're laughing, we're loving it all
But look at our life now
All tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight
And delight in the tears
That we cry until dawn
Oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let love be the start
Let love be the start

[Verse 2]
You say I'm a dreamer
We're two of a kind
Both of us searching
For some perfect world
We know we'll never find
So perhaps I should leave here
Yeah, yeah, and go far away
But you know that there's nowhere
That I'd rather be
Than with you here today
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart
Stay with me
Let love be the start
Let love be the start, whoa
Hold me now, whoa
Warm my heart

Let love be the start, whoa

[Verse 3]
You ask if I love you
Well, what can I say?
You know that I do
And that this is just one
Of those games that we play
So I'll sing you a new song
Please don't cry anymore
I'll even ask your forgiveness
Though I don't know
Just what I'm asking it for
Oh, whoa, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Hold me now, (hold me in your loving arms) whoa
Warm my heart (warm my cold and tired heart)
Stay with me (stay with me)

Hello
Who is this?
(Obscene phone caller, oh)

[Verse 1]
I came home knocked out after work
That's when my telephone goes berserk
How can I unwind or get some rest
Receiving sick phone calls from a lonely pest?

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh) Find someone else to bother
(Mister or miss) Obscene phone caller
(Why do you) Get off breathing on the phone?
(Obscene phone caller) Leave me alone

[Verse 2]
Why did you have to pick me
Out of all the people in the directory?
I don't know what's going through your mind
But these naughty phone calls are a waste of time

I must have my number changed
Or trace these calls from whence they came
If Alexander Bell were alive today
Would he want the telephone to be used this way?
[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh) Find someone else to bother
(Mister or miss) Obscene phone caller
(Why do you) Get off breathing on the phone?
(Obscene phone caller) Leave me alone

[Bridge]
Listen here
I don't understand why you're callin' me, you know
I don't know who you are
You know, you call me every day, you breathe on the phone
Just let me know if you're a girl or something, maybe I'll talk to you
But you know, you don't say anything but...

[Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh) Find someone else to bother (Obscene phone caller)
(Mister or miss) Obscene phone caller
(Why do you) Get off breathing on the phone? (Obscene phone caller)
(Obscene phone caller) Leave me alone

443,1984,Go-Go's,Head Over Heels,"Been running so long
I've nearly lost all track of time
In every direction
I couldn't see the warning signs
I must be losin' it
'Cause my mind plays tricks on me
It looked so easy
But you know, looks sometimes deceive

Been running so fast
Right from the starting line
No more connections
I don't need any more advice
One hand's just reaching out
And one's just hangin' on
It seems my weaknesses
Just keep going strong

Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Been running so hard
When what I need is to unwind
The voice of reason
Is one I left so far behind
I've waited so long
So long to play this part
And just remembered
That I'd forgotten about my heart
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync

Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think
Looks like the whole world's out of sync
Head over heels, where should I go?
Can't stop myself, out of control
Head over heels, no time to think

Something in the air
Maybe for the only time in my life
Something in the air
Turning me around and guiding me right

You got the perfect image
Of the perfect man

Guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironin' out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know

[Chorus]
Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)
Why don't you tune in and turn them on?
They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)
When all hope is gone (ooh)
Sad songs say so much

[Verse 2]
If someone else is sufferin' enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

So turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone (ah...)

Just feel their gentle touch (gentle touch)

How your touch was so tender

Until it was gone
A second once in a lifetime
May be too much to ask
But I swear from now on

If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll love you much better
If ever you're in my arms again
This time I'll hold you forever
This time we'll never end

How I still need you near me

That won't ever leave us
There's no letting go

If ever you're in my arms again

There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Chorus]
What's love got to do ooh , got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it
What's love?"
457,1984,Sergio Mendes,Alibis,"It's nothing I can put my finger on
But it's there, I swear
It's not somethin' I'm imaginin'
Each time you call
I know I'll get your ""working late routine"" again

Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?

I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
You're slippin' away from me

Your telephone service says you're out again
Somewhere out there
You've got another rendezvous
I know the way you work
You'll be someplace where no one can check up on you

You think you're in the clear
But don't forget
That's exactly the way we met
I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell
I know the pattern much too well
I don't fool so easily
You're slippin away from me

Is there someone I should know about?
Tell me why do I have this doubt?

I'm sure your alibis are water tight
And you're where you have to be tonight
Oh, but I know you're slipping away from me
I'm know your alibis are water tight
And you're where you say you are tonight
But honey, I can tell

Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk
From a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
Mmm

Tears from your little sister
Crying because
She doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
But you know she'll get by

[Chorus:]
Cause she's living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can
[Verse 2:]
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
(It's a good thing, ouch)
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it

In the snow on the ground
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
You gotta walk into town to find a job
(What's it now?)
Trying to keep your hands warm
(It's so cold)

When the hole in your shoe
Let the snow come through
And chill you to the bone
(Brrr, cha)
Somehow you'd better go home where it's warm

[Chorus:]
Where you can
Live in a love of the common people
Smile from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(So cold)
And she can
[Bridge:]
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit
The tighter the fit
(The closer the knit)

And the chills stay away
(Ow, ah, ah, yeah)
Just to take 'em in stride for family pride

You know that faith is your foundation
(Ooh, now, ooh, now, ooh, now)
With a whole lotta love
And a warm conversation

But don't forget to pray
(Forget to pray)
Just making it strong where you belong

[Chorus:]
And we're living
In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you just
As much as she can
(You're so cold)
And she can
Yes, we're living
In the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(You're so cold)

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's from the heart of a family man
(What's it now?)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
(You're so cold)

Living in the love of the common people
Smile's really hard on a family man
(Ah, ah, yeah)

Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Mama's gonna love you
Just as much as she can
And she can"

One way or the other
Nobody wins without once giving in

Love is just a game you play in high school
Girls know how to be cruel
Most of the time, girls are cruel to be kind
So don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

At the end of the day, making love to a paper moon

They make time
They get love on a Saturday night""

""Hearts beat as they dance in the street to a radio
Oh, oh, oh
B-b-b-boys fall in love""

Baby knows I like to get excited
No one wants to fight it
It's getting late, so I'll just demonstrate
Don't cry now
Ooh, don't cry now

460,1984,Berlin,No More Words,"You're talking, it all sounds fair
You promise your love, how much you care
I'm still listening and still unsure
Your actions are lacking, nothing is clear

[Chorus]
No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love

Remember when the words were new?
They carried a meaning, a feeling so true
Well, I'm looking for a long romance
Not a picture of passion or one time chance

[Chorus]
No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love

But don't fool yourself
Your empty passion won't satisfy me, I know
So don't pretend that you want me
You don't want me, no
[Chorus]
No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love

We make love, it's all the same
Your eyes show nothing, no lover's flame
Well, don't promise we can work it out
You can leave right now if you're feeling doubt

[Chorus]
No more words
You're telling me you love me while you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love

No more words
You're telling me you love me and looking away
No more words and no more promises
No more words and no more promises

No more words
You're telling me you love me, you're looking away
No more words
No more words and no more promises of love
No more words and no more promises

Is the news of the day
Angels fall like rain
And love, love, love, love is all of heaven away (Love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)
She don't fade (Down here no more)
Inside you the time moves (It's coming down)
And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

[Verse 2]
A race is on, I'm on your side
And hearing you, my engines die
I'm in a mood for you
For running away
Stars come down in you
And love, love, love, you can't give it away (love, love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)
The ghost in you (And rain don't fall)

And she don't fade (To losing it in you)

Don't you go
It makes no sense
When all your talking supermen
Just take away the time
And get in the way
Ain't it just like rain?
And love, love, love, love is only heaven away (love, love, love, love)

Inside you the time moves (Drums beat time)
And she don't fade (In you and I)

You don't know how bad I got it
You got it easy
You don't know when you've got it good
It's getting harder
Just keeping life and soul together
I'm sick of fighting
Even though I know I should
The cold is biting
Through each and every nerve and fiber
My broken spirit
Is frozen to the core
I don't want to be here no more

[Chorus]
Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes
Even if it was for just one day?
Wouldn't it be good if we could wish ourselves away?
Wouldn't it be good to be on your side?
The grass is always greener over there
Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

[Verse 2]
You must be joking
You don't know a thing about it
You've got no problem
I'd stay right there if I were you
I got it harder
You couldn't dream how hard I got it
Stay out of my shoes
If you know what's good for you
The heat is stifling
Burning me up from the inside
The sweat is coming
Through each and every pore
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more
I don't want to be here no more

Wouldn't it be good to be in your shoes

Wouldn't it be good if we could live without a care?

My 16th birthday I was so shy
Not yet a man but ready to try
Music playing people swaying
I looked around, oh, she caught my eye
Smoke-filled room I could hardly see
There she was moving closer to me
She told me her name before I could speak
Took my hand and then she said these words to me

Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light
That's what she said me
Tonight, ooh
This is the night you'll see the light

Hey beautiful girl so lovely tonight
Show me the way show me the light

Next thing I knew we started to groove
Dancing and dancing moving so free
A feeling of love had come over me
I held her close and knew it was right
What a birthday surprise I had finally seen the light

475,1984,Orion The Hunter,So You Ran,"Woke up this morning and you were gone
Found your note by the telephone
You said goodbye
I won't be back this way

I guess in time Ill figure it out
The flame burned and flickered out
You sped away and you turned down the highway

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away

Seemed like I never got a hold on you
The harder I tried the more desperate I grew
I should have known I couldn't change your heart
You once said you need to be free
Oh babe you could have been with me
You fade away like the sun turning to darkness

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away
In this life we might find our way
But love is more than just day to day

Why (Echo) why why why

So you ran
So you ran
So you ran

Baby
I wonder who your with tonight
Can he save you from the sacrafice
Will he love you hold you
For another day
Or is it just a stop on your lonly highway

Baby

So you ran(you keep on runnin)
Took the heart of a lonly man
So you ran
I hope youd say
But now youve gone away"
476,1984,Tracey Ullman,They Don't Know,"[Verse 1:]
You've been around
For such a long time now
Oh, maybe I could leave you
But I don't know how

And why should I be lonely every night
When I can be with you
Oh, yes
You make it right

[Chorus:]
And I don't listen to the guys who say
That you're bad for me
And I should turn you away
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

[Verse 2:]
I get a feeling when I look at you
Wherever you go now
I wanna be there too

They say we're crazy
But I just don't care
And if they keep on talking
Still they get nowhere
[Chorus:]
So I don't mind if they don't understand
When I look at you when you hold my hand
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love

[Bridge:]
Why should it matter to us
If they don't approve
We should just take our chances
While we've got nothing to lose
Baby

[Verse 3:]
There's no need for living in the past
Now I've found good loving
Gonna make it last

I tell the others
Don't bother me
Cause when they look at you
They don't see what I see

[Repeat Chorus x3:]
No, I don't listen to their wasted lines
Got my eyes wide open
And I see the signs
Cause they don't know 'bout us
And they've never heard of love"

A new kind of rime and rhythm
A new kind of poetry
A road I never traveled
A brand new melody

[Verse 2: Patrick Jude]
I know I never met you
But somehow more and more
I get this funny feeling
That I've known you before

A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me

[Verse 3: Patrick Jude]
In your eyes, I see places
Places that I've never seen
Things that I couldn't never known
And somehow I know what they mean

[Verse 4: Jenny Burton]
We so very different
We are like night and day
Your words, they sound so strange to me
Yet I understand everything you say
[Chorus: Jenny Burton & Patrick Jude]
A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me

[Verse 5: Patrick Jude & Jenny Burton]
Have we met before?
In some other yesterday
Have we met before?
Or does love just make it seem that way

[Verse 6: Jenny Burton & Patrick Jude]
Coming from different directions
Carrying different dreams
A brand new river flowing
From two very different streams
Worlds that come together
Somehow we have found
A bridge across our differences
To a common ground

[Chorus: Jenny Burton & Patrick Jude]
A stranger, in a strange world
A world full of mystery
A stranger, in a strange world
Yet you ain't no stranger to me"

Tony Carey

Well The Kid and me were the team to beat
We could stand up to the big boys
Generate some heat
And we never thought nothin' about
Livin on the streat back then

Yes sir, we lied a little
And we maybe stole some
Sayin ""Southern CA here we come""
And we took off down the highway sayin'
Never goin' back again

Chorus:
It was on the first day of summer
We were the number one outfront runner
On the first day of summer
Nothin feels the same
And it feels so good
It was on the first day of summer
It was on the first day of summer
On the first day of summer
The whole world knows your name
And it feels so good
Now the kid was drivin and I rode shotgun
We were splittin up the money
From our number ones

Beatin' time to the radio
Yes I'm gonna be someone

Campin' by the road out in Santa Fe
The kid stole the keys and he drove away
I wound up washin' dishes at a a Holiday Inn
Sometime I wonder what became of him

480,1984,Dan Fogelberg,Believe In Me,"If I could ever say it right
And reach your hostage heart
Despite the doubts you harbor
Then you might
Come to believe in me

The life I lead is not the kind
That gives a woman peace of mind
I only hope someday you'll find
That you can believe in me

Those other loves that
Came before
Mean nothing to me anymore
But you can never be quite sure
And will not believe in me

Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Too many hearts have been broken
Failing to trust what they feel
But trust isn't something
That's spoken
And love's never wrong
When it's real

If I could only do one thing
Then I would try to write and sing
A song that ends your questioning
And makes you believe in me
Makes you believe in me

Ow
Fine lady
Ow

I like the way she walks, I like the way she talks
As she turns me on with a special concern
Now, I'm a different guy, and I don't compare to many
But next to her I'm plain ordinary
Not many can see the light blue aura
That surrounds the girl wherever in the world
She's a nine, a ten, a twenty-fifth
She's bittersweet and a taco treat

(She's strange) Just the way she is

She's my Rolling Stones and my Eva Perón

(And I like it) Yes, I like it
(I like it) The way she wears her hair
(And I like it) Mmm, mmm
(I like it)
In room 123, she's elusive, you see
Like the invisible man in drag
And when you come to meet her, you'll never greet her
She'll be waving her skirt as a flag
Like the cold in October, she'll take you right over
It's not mean to be facetious
And that look in her eye says you're the guy
She plans to spend this evening with

And the perfect waves are starting to come
His hair is flying out in ribbons of gold
And his touch has got the power to stun

I've got a dream 'bout an angel in the forest
Enchanted by the edge of a lake
His body's flowing in the jewels alive
And the earth below is starting to shake

But I don't see any angels in the city
I don't hear any holy choirs sing
And if I can't get an angel
I can still get a boy
And a boy'd be the next best thing
The next best thing to an angel
A boy'd be the next best thing
I've got a dream 'bout a boy in a castle
And he's dancing like a cat on the stairs
He's got the fire of a prince in his eyes
And the thunder of a drum in his ears

I've got a dream 'bout a boy on a star
Lookin' down upon the rim of the world
He's there all alone and dreamin' of someone like me
I'm not an angel but at least I'm a girl
I've got a dream when the darkness is over

We're throwin' down with a rack of Bozaks

You gotta boogie to your best ability
You gotta funk it up until it knocks you down

And I'm a surefire, pure blooded bonafide house rockin' Jam-On Production MC
If you want the best, come put me to the test, and I'm sure you'll soon agree
That I've got no flaws 'cause I'm down by law when it comes to rockin' viciously, you see
'Cause when I was a little baby boy, my mama gave me a brand new toy
Two turntables with a mic, and I learned to rock like Dolemite
Time went by, on this God's creation, I knew someday I would rock the nation
So I made up my mind just what to do and I joined with the Jam-On Production Crew
So go crazy, go crazy, don't let your body be lazy
I said don't stop the body rock till your eyesight starts to get hazy
Clean out your ears and you open your eyes
If you wanna hear the music just come alive
An if you don't know how get ready to learn

I've got the beat that's, oh, so sweet
Without me rockin' it's incomplete
So rock this y'all, rock that y'all
Rock on and don't you dare stop
You rock this, rock that, and that's a fact
'Cause the Jam-On Crew will rock your body right back
Rock a steam locomotive right off the track

Then go on ahead and flaunt it

It's what separates us from the rest
And if you don't think our crew's down for real
Let me tell you what happened to the man of steel
(Say Superman had came to town to see who he could rock)
(He blew away every crew he faced until he reached our block)
(His speakers were three stories high, with woofers made of steel)
(And when we brought our set outside, he said) ""Hah, be for real!""
He said, I'm faster than a speedin' bullet when I'm on the set
I don't need no fans to cool my amps, I just use my super breath
I could fly three times around the world without missin' a beat
I socialize with X-ray eyes, and the ladies think it's sweet
(And then he turned his power on and the ground began to move)
(And all the buildings for miles around were swayin' to the groove)
(And just when he had pulled the crowd and swore he'd won the fight)
We rocked his butt with a 12 inch cut called ""Disco Kryptonite""
(Rock'em Cozmo!)
Well, Superman looked up at me, he said, ""You rock so naturally""
I said now that you've learned the deal, let me tell you why I'm so for real
I'm Cozmo D from outer space
I came to rock the human race
I do it right 'cause I can't do it wrong
That's why the whole world is singin' this song
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
As day turns to night and night turns to day
Whatever time it is I wanna hear you say
(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-m-m-m-m, jam on it
Jam all around and upside down
Keep jammin' to the Jam On Production sound

(Jam on it) Jam on it
I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
I said Jam On is the funky beat that takes control
With the sure shot boogie that'll rock your soul

I said jam-j-j-j-jam on it
Get outta your seat and jam to the beat
And don't you dare stop till early mornin'

Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it
Jam on it, jam on it, jam on it, jam on it

(Yeah, that's how you do it Cozmo)
(You rocked it, that's the way you do it)

I believe you when you say that you love me

So won't you hold me, touch me
Make me your woman tonight

There's something in your eyes I see
I won't betray your trust in me

489,1984,The Alan Parsons Project,Don't Answer Me,"If you believe in the power magic
I can change your mind
And if you need to believe in someone
Turn and look behind
When we were living in a dream world
Clouds got in the way
We gave it up in a moment of madness
And threw it all away
Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Don't let me in
Run away and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?
If you believe in the power of magic
It's all a fantasy
So if you need to believe in someone
Just pretend it's me
It ain't enough that we meet as strangers
I can't set you free
So will you turn your back forever on what you mean to me?

Don't answer me, don't break the silence
Don't let me win
Don't answer me, stay on your island
Don't let me in
Run away and hide from everyone
Can you change the things we've said and done?"

I held her close to me
'Cause I know she breaks so easily
And then I told her
But I knew no matter how I tried to console her
She'd just do the best she could
But there are times the best is no damn good
And no matter how you try to be kind
There's always still a part of you you leave behind

[Chorus]
When it falls apart
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart

[Verse 2]
I lied and told her she'd be fine
Though we both knew it was just a line
I had to do it
'Cause I'da said anything to help me get through it
Then she reached out for my hand
And her simple touch was more than I could stand
And I had to turn away
'Cause I knew all the hurt
That she was feeling I was feeling too

[Chorus]
'Cause when it falls apart
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart
[Bridge]
She could've gotten angry
And made me feel like a guilty child
But I realized that never was her style
I wanted her to hurt me
And not treat me like a friend
I wanted her to say there'd be someday
I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her back again
But she acted like a lady 'til the end
Oh, what a lady

[Verse 3]
I thought that she'd break down
But she smiled at me and never made a sound
And I guess she understood in her way
'Cause her silence told me everything she could not say

When it falls apart
Oh, there's just no easy way
There's just no easy way
There's no easy way to break somebody's heart"

492,1984,Tony Carey,A Fine Fine Day,"When my Uncle Sonny blew back into town
Said ""I'll just go for a ride
And have a look 'round.""
And he took off his fedora
And stuck his fingers in the crown
And he pulled out twenty dollars
And he laid that money down

And he called out to a taxi cab
""Take me down to Central Park
And keep that meter runnin'
To the twenty dollar mark.""
And he kept his eyes turned forward
And he sat up straight and tall
And no one even noticed him
No one cared at all

It's a fine, fine day
For a reunion
It's a fine, fine day
For comin' home
You did your sittin'
You did hard time
But you ain't gonna sit no more
They can't keep you there no more
It's a fine, fine day
And nothin's gonna take you
Nothin's gonna take you away
It's a fine, fine day, oh yeah
First time I saw Sonny
I was just about this tall
And he always made my momma
Kinda crazy when he'd call
Him and my old man
Would stand and whisper in the hall
Then they'd disappear
And maybe not come home at all

Then one day Sonny stopped comin' round
Heard he'd gotten himself into
A little trouble out in town
Sometime after that
He finally disappeared for good
Then he pulled that ol' Houdini
Like we always knew he would!

It's a fine, fine day
For a reunion
It's a fine, fine day
For comin' home
You did your sittin'
You did hard time
But you ain't gonna sit no more
They can't keep you there no more
It's a fine, fine day, oh yeah
And nothin's gonna drag you
Nothin's gonna drag you away
Oh yeah, it's a fine, fine day
Fine day

I see you're none the worse for wear
It's been a long time comin'
Nothin's gonna drag you away from here!""

Afternoon in the homeroom
They're about to let you go
And the locker slam on the plan
You had tonight
You've been messin' around with a boyfriend
Maybe better left alone
There's a wise guy that you know could
Put you right
In the lot the boy that's idling by
Doesn't rev your heart
Cause it's only lonely spots
He shares with you
And long halls and the gray walls
Are gonna split apart
Believe it or not
There's life after high school
And that's why

Get home you're not alone

And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He's loved in seven languages

Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights and business nights
When you require streetcar desire for higher heights

No place to be ending but somewhere to start

513,1985,Glenn Frey,Smuggler's Blues,"There's trouble on the street tonight
I can feel it in my bones
I had a premonition that
He should not go alone

I knew the gun was loaded
But I didn't think he'd kill
Everything exploded
And the blood began to spill

So, baby
Here's your ticket
Put the suitcase in your hand
Here's a little money now

Do it just the way we planned
You be cool for twenty hours
And I'll pay you twenty grand

I'm sorry it went down like this
Someone had to lose
It's the nature of the business
It's the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues

The sailors and the pilots
The soldiers and the law
The payoffs and the ripoffs
And the things nobody saw
No matter if it's heroin
Cocaine or hash
You've got to carry weapons
Cause you always carry cash

There's lots of shady characters
Lots of dirty deals
Every name's an alias
In case somebody squeals

It's the lure of easy money
It's gotta very strong appeal
Perhaps you'd understand it better
Standing in my shoes

It's the ultimate enticement
It's the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues

See it in the headlines
You hear it every day
They say they're gonna stop it
But it doesn't go away

They move it through Miami
Sell it in L.A
They hide it up in Telluride
I mean it's here to stay
It's propping up the governments
Of Columbia and Peru
You ask any DEA man
He'll say there's nothing we can do

From the office of the President
Right down
To me and you
Me and you

It's a losing proposition
But one you can't refuse
It's the politics of contraband
It's the smuggler's blues
Smuggler's blues"

Meeting you with a view to a kill

Nightfall covers me, but you know the plans I'm making
Still overseas, could it be the whole Earth opening wide
A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside
A week is why, until we...

Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire

[Verse 2]
The choice for you is the view to a kill
Between the shades assassination standing still

Earth's crystal tears, the fall of snowflakes on your body
First time in years to drench your skin in lover's rosy stain
A chance to find the phoenix for the flame
A chance to die, but can we...
[Chorus]
Dance into the fire
That fatal kiss is all we need
Dance into the fire
To fatal sounds of broken dreams

That fatal kiss is all we need

Who am I to blame you for doubting what you feel
I was always reachin', you were just a girl I knew
I took for granted the friend I have in you

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Can we last forever, do we fall apart
At times it's so confusing, the questions of the heart
You followed me through changes and patiently you'd wait
Till I came to my senses through some miracle of fate

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Now I look into your eyes, I can see forever
The search is over, you were with me all the while

Now the miles stretch out behind me
Loves that I have lost
Broken hearts lie victims of the game
Then good luck it finally struck
Like lightnin' from the blue
Every highway is leadin' me back to you
Now at last I hold you, now all is said and done
The search has come full circle, our destinies are one
So if you ever loved me, show me that you give a damn
You'll know for certain, the man I really am

I was living for a dream, loving for a moment
Taking on the world, that was just my style
Then I touched your hand, I could hear you whisper
The search is over, love was right before my eyes"

That's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her

She had the nerve to ask me
If I planned to do her any harm
So, look here
I put her on the back of my bike
And-a we went riding
Down by old man Johnson's farm
I said now, overcast days never turned me on
But something about the clouds and her mixed
She wasn't too bright
But I could tell when she kissed me
She knew how to get her kicks
She wore a...

And if it was warm she wouldn't wear much more

The rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof
And the horses wonder who you are
Thunder drowns out what the lightning sees
You feel like a movie star
Listen, they say the first time ain't the greatest
But I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again
I wouldn't change a stroke
'Cause baby I'm the most
With a girl as fine as she was then

522,1985,Murray Head,One Night In Bangkok,"[Verse 1]
Bangkok, Oriental setting
The city don't know what the city is getting
The crème de la crème of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner
Times flies, doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tirolean Spa had the chess boards in it
All change, don't you know that when you
Play at this level, there's no ordinary venue?
It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings, or
Or this place

[Chorus]
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples, but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel sliding up to me

[Verse 2]
One town's very like another
When your head's down over your pieces, brother
It's a drag, it's a bore, it's really such a pity
To be looking at the board, not looking at the city
What do ya mean?
You've seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town
Tea girls, warm and sweet (Warm, sweet)
Some are set up in the Somerset Maugham suite
Get Thai'd! You're talking to a tourist
Whose every move's among the purest
I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine
[Chorus]
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me

[Verse 3]
Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddah
And thank God I'm only watching the game, controlling it
I don't see you guys rating the kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you
So you'd better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlours

[Chorus]
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples, but the pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history
I can feel an angel sliding up to me
One night in Bangkok makes the hard man humble
Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble
Can't be too careful with your company
I can feel the devil walkin' next to me"
523,1985,REO Speedwagon,One Lonely Night,"You and your baby
Had some words today
Til not another word
Was left to say

I see that grin, boy
Maybe you think you'll win, boy
Until the sun goes down
And once again, boy

One lonely night

That's all it takes to
Completely break you

They say it's darkest
Right before the dawn
But, oh, those darkest hours
Can be so long

You're feelin' strong, boy
Tellin' yourself she's wrong, boy
But how much longer can
This night go on, boy

One lonely night

That's all it takes to
Completely break you

You should know she's one of a kind

Completely break you"
524,1985,'Til Tuesday,Voices Carry,"I'm in the dark, I'd like to read his mind
But I'm frightened of the things I might find
Oh, there must be something he's thinking of
To tear him away-a-ay
When I tell him that I'm falling in love
Why does he say-a-ay

Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Uh-ah

I try so hard not to get upset
Because I know all the trouble I'll get
Oh, he tells me tears are something to hide
And something to fear-eh-eh
And I try so hard to keep it inside
So no one can hear

Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry

Oh!
He wants me, but only part of the time
He wants me, if he can keep me in line
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry
Hush, hush, shut up now, voices carry
Hush, hush, keep it down now, voices carry

Always on the run

When the world must come together as one
There are people dying

What'cha doin' out there
Who you tryin' to be

'Cause I've been there myself
I've been kicked so many times
I don't know nothin' else

Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the flair
That ya got from chasin'
All those east coast dares
And I've seen it before
It happens time and again
All cut up inside
Yet you're caught in a spin

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find out
Guess I'll leave it up to you

Saw you dancin' out at Madame Wong Two's
You did the same two steps
That I taught you back in June
Heard you dined last night
At Conte Razor's Café
Did you get your fill
Did you think you had to pay
Still I noticed your urgency
And recognized the pain
And I'm sure it's the same
You feel again and again
And I wish I could get us
That second chance
But you're having too much fun
With your sudden romance

Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Take a good hard look
There ain't nothin' ever new
Out on Sentimental Street in the Avenues
Will you ever find us

Not even to call me

If I had the nerve to quit you

And you don't really care
I know this romance
It ain't going nowhere
Invisible just like my love. You treat me like I'm invisible
When you get the need to flirt you do your worst

You just don't care how much it hurts

I can never reach you on the phone
It rings and rings
But I know you're home
It may be naive but I just want to believe I'm the only one
I tell myself lies and give you alibies
Knowing your promises you'll never keep
Like the merry go round

I'm going down
I'm on a dead end street

Invisible just like my love

You let me down, with all your runnin' round
Still you pretend and try to call me friend
Don't say a word, I know just what I heard
Yeah you been loose, you just got no excuse
Just feel my rage, why can't you come of age?

I felt it all, just like a cannonball

Then you got mad, you said that I'm all bad
So what's the use, you lied and that's the truth
You took the key and drove right out on me
I never knew, put all my trust in you

OK that's it, I'm leaving now, I quit
I was unwise, so don't apologize
I paid the price, for taking your advice
I felt it all, just like a cannonball

You can say what you want all day
But I've never been so outraged
I'm washing my hands of you
How could you be so untrue
You know I can't stand no more
You know I can't stand no more"

I've learned to smile and deceive
I know I'm hard to be around
But you never leave

I'm not easy to understand
But you hold out your hand

And you say you love me
Just as I am
You always treat me
The best that you can
You say you want me, need me
Love me, baby
Just as I am, just as I am

I've made a lot of heartaches
I've found a lot of closed doors
When all the others turn away
You love me more
You love me more
I'm not easy to understand
But you hold out your hand

And you say you love me
Just as I am
You always treat me
The best that you can
You say you want me, need me
Love me, baby

I want to love forever
To keep our world together

Look, check it out
There's a whole lot of girls
Messin' around, trying to get me
They do things 'cause they know
My girl is away, they try to upset me
They can't believe I resist
How can I hold out? Where is that girl now?
But the truth really is
I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so...

[Chorus]
No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up 'til I get enough

I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

Listen
I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets to achin'
Is she thinking of me

'Cause our thing is for real
And I don't worry 'cause I know, I know, I know...

Every night when I sleep
I dream of my baby, she's such a lady
Then I wake up and see

'Cause our love is for real
And I don't worry 'cause I know, I know, I know...

Understand what's on my mind

That if you want to stay close

Cause I'm not a light unto myself
Without a thing of value, why settle for second best
We don't know what's up ahead
And we can't let ourselves forget

Bringing me to life with every bite
A single touch is just enough to stir the animal inside of me

Weak from the heat

'Cause she a dark angel riding dark horses
Sitting pretty in her dim lit corners ...

Black cars look better in the shade
Black cars

She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps
For all those phantom lovers in her dreams

She smokes them French cigarettes
In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress
She cuts a perfect silhouette
But she's a dark angel wearing dark glasses
A fading beauty as the night time passes

They forecast heavy seas and gale force winds

When I'm falling down
Deeper than the underground
My thoughts race back to you

And you criticize

I'm pretending and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending
Ain't making it through to your heart
You've been hiding, never letting it show
Always trying to keep it under control
You got it down and you're well
On the way to the top
But there's something that you forgot

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
You might need it someday

I can't tell you what you're feeling inside
I can't sell you what you don't want to buy
Something's missing and you got to
Look back on your life
You know something here just ain't right

What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you
What about love
Don't you want someone to care about you
What about love
Don't let it slip away
What about love
I only want to share it with you"

All my friends say he's much too hot
Don't get involved, it's emotional shock
But, ooh, he charges my electricity
When he puts his finger on me
I said a oh, oh, oh, you know I want you
And I, and I, and I need you, pretty baby
I'm in the fire, there's just no turning back
Though I know, know, know, whoa-whoa-whoa...

You're dangerous

So hot and heavy, I know that I just can't resist
Ooh, dangerous

Oh, you're dangerous
Wild even stranger, need a little danger

Hoo, ooh...

Ooh, you make your move and I'm begging please
Then you're pushing me away, you know you're such a tease
One look can drive me right out of my mind
And get my heart pumping double time
And then I hear myself say you better be strong
Stay away; he's gonna do wrong
You better run, girl, while you've got the chance
'Cause you know, know, know, whoa-whoa-whoa
He's dangerous

Your love, oh, oh, oh
Ooh, oh, oh, oh

I'm in too deep and when you're close to me
I get so weak
Our bodies touch and then our hearts collide
I feel inside, emotional love exploding

Oh, dangerous

So hot and heavy I know that I just can't resist (this)
Ooh, dangerous

558,1985,Kenny Loggins,Forever,"Now, while we're here alone
And all is said and done
Now I can let you know
Because of all you've shown
I've grown enough to tell you
You'll always be inside of me

How many roads have gone by
So many words left unspoken
I needed to be by your side
If only to hold you

Forever in my heart
Forever, we will be
And even when I'm gone
You'll be here in me
Forever

Once, I dreamed that you were gone
I cried out trying to find you
I begged the dream to fade away
And please awaken me

But night took a hold of my heart
And left me with no one to follow
The love that I lost to the dark
I'll always remember
Forever in my heart
Forever here you'll be
Know that when I'm gone
You'll be near to me
Forever in my life

Always thought I'd be
I'd be yours

Forever"
559,1985,Klymaxx,Meeting In The Ladies Room,"[Intro]
I had to leave my condo to come to this
Well, I'm back, but this time I'm with my man
And these women are putting their hands
All over his Yamamoto Kanzai sweater that I bought
And I'm much, much unhappy about that
I'd hate to come down to their level
And become a BW, a basic woman
But if they don't stop, it's gonna get scandalous
Oh, oh!

[Chorus]
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
(I don't need this)
I'll be back real soon
(That's what I get for being in the neighborhood)
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
(Where's my jewelry?)
I'll be back real soon
(Can we talk?)

[Verse 1]
I don't know, but I think you better watch your man
(Girl, you better watch your man)
'Cause girl, he's doing like nobody else can
(All the girls are watching him)
If you wanna be sure, you best go powder your nose
(Go on and powder your nose)
'Cause you wanna look good when you step on the floor
That's why

I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon

Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Mmm, everybody, sing it like
Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
Stepped through the door, they were standing in line
(Took their time)
Smoking funny cigarettes and taking their time
(Something must be on their minds)
Pass me a mirror (Hurry up)
'Cause I ain't got much time (Quick, I got to get right back)
Cause there's a hunk of man I done left behind
That's why

[Chorus]
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I told my man
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon

Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Everybody, sing it like
Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Don't be a Freak-a-Zoid
[Verse 3]
Walked on the floor and everybody was jamming
They're playing my favorite song, got me singing along
Can't turn your back for a minute, somebody's rocking my man
And girl, they're doing like nobody else can
Watch out, watch out, watch out

[Bridge]
Excuse me, ladies, this man's with me
I don't like to share, you can plainly see
He looks good, good enough to eat
But believe me, lady, he belongs to me, yeah

560,1985,Amy Grant,Find A Way,"You tell me your friends are distant
You tell me your man's untrue
You tell me that you've been walked on
And how you feel abused

So you stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
I hear you saying that you want to see changes
But you don't know how to start

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way
(A way to go)
Love can make a way
(Only love can know)
Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way

I know this life is a strange thing
I can't answer all the whys
Tragedy always finds me
Taken again by surprise
I could stand here an angry young woman
Taking all the pain to heart
But I know that love can bring changes
And so we've got to move on

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way
I know that love will find a way
(A way to go)
Love can make a way
(Only love can know)
Leave behind the doubt
Love's the only out
Love will surely find a way

If our God His Son not sparing
Came to rescue you
Is there any circumstance
That He can't see you through?

Love will find a way
(How do you know?)
Love will find a way
(How can you see?)
I know it's hard to see
The past and still believe
Love is gonna find a way

561,1985,Don Henley,Not Enough Love In The World,"Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
But I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl-
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do
And it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like
Children on a playground
Even after that ol' sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darlin', this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile-
For the world, for the camera-
And still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody
Just take good care of yourself
I'm not easy to live with-
I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe
And that's one of the things I loved about you
But a time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get of this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking you're light
Though I kept on trying I could not make it right
For you girl
There's just not enough love in the world"

I just want you to hold me

How love can make our dreams come true
Let me hold you and I'll give you
All that you'll ever need, please just believe me
Whenever I call you
You're never at home

When they start talking
I turn the other way
Girl, I want you to know that I need you so

As long as you hold me

Tried so hard to make you see
But I couldn't find the words
Now the tears, they fall like rain
I'm alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you
Alone again without you

I said stay, but you turned away
Tried to say that it was me
Now I'm here and I've lost my way
Now I know how it feels
I'm alone again

565,1985,Paul Hardcastle,19,"In 1965, Vietnam seemed like
Just another foreign war
But it wasn't, it was
Different in many ways

As so were those
Who did the fighting
In World War II
The average age of the
Combat soldier was twenty-six

[Chorus]
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
In Vietnam, he was nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen

The heaviest fighting
Of the past two weeks
Continued today twenty-five
Miles northwest of Saigon

I really wasn't sure
What was going on
[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen, nineteen
N-nineteen, nineteen

In Vietnam, the combat soldier
Typically served a twelve month tour of duty
But was exposed to hostile fire almost everyday

[Chorus]
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen
N-n-n-n-nineteen

In Saigon, a US miltary spokesman
Said today, more than 720 troops
Were killed last week in
That sensitive border area
In all of South Vietnam
The enemy lost a total of
2,689 soldiers

[Bridge]
All those who remember the war
They won't forget what they've seen
Destruction of men in their prime
Whose average age was nineteen
D-d-d-d-d-destruction
D-d-d-d-d-destruction

According to a Veteran's Administration study
Half of the Vietnam combat veterans suffered
From what psychiatrists call
Post traumatic stress disorder
Many vets complain of alienation, rage, or guilt
Some succumb to suicidal thoughts
Eight to ten years after coming home
Almost eight-hundred-thousand men
Are still fighting the Vietnam War

None of them received
A hero's welcome

Alright

I am the one of a kind

I'm fascinated by you
There's something about you
That makes all the difference
Like the night is to day
Well I can get along without you
But I know that within you
You've got what I'm missing
And I'll find a way
To get reaction to action
Hey, say the word that would thrill me
Yeah, I need reaction to action
Just one look that would kill me
You got a way of drawing attention to you
You know you stand out in a crowd
But the way that you play
With any man's affections
Should never be allowed
See I consider myself
The one who will show you
I'd go as far as to say
Girl, I ain't leaving here without you
But you better understand
There's only one rule in this game we're going to play
And that's reaction to action
Maybe like a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
One look that would kill me
Give me reaction to action
It's getting late I'd better make a definite move
Reaction to action
And after that baby, it's up to you
I need reaction to action
Just a word that would thrill me
I need reaction to action
You know what I'm talking about
Give me some reaction to action
You got a look, you got a way that'll kill me

Reaction to action, reaction to action, action
Baby, don't think about it, just react
Reaction to action[x6]"
571,1985,Animotion,Let Him Go,"You're holding him so tight
That he can't move
If you never give him room
You're gonna lose

He's feeling like he's
Tied up in a knot
Every time he comes home late
He's on the spot

Trust him to be
The kind of man he wants to be
You aren't gonna keep him long
If you give him the third degree

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you

You want your life with him
To work so well
You forget the love you need
To give yourself
I understand your desire
To keep him near
But you poison love when
You mix it up with fear

Trust yourself to be the woman
That you want to be
If you both have room to grow
Then you'll live in harmony

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you

Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you

Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you
Let him go
Let him go, ooh
Let him go, ooh
Let him go"

Since I don't know when
And all she wants to do is dance

Molotov cocktail, the local drink
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They mix 'em up right
In the kitchen sink
And all she wants to do is dance

Crazy people walkin' round
With blood in their eyes
And all she wants to do is dance, dance, dance

Wild-eyed pistol-wavers
Who ain't afraid to die
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance
She can't feel the heat
Comin off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
Well the government bugged the men's room
In the local disco lounge
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

To keep the boys from sellin'
All the weapons they could scrounge
And all she wants to do is dance

But that don't keep the boys
From makin' a buck or two
And all she wants to do is dance, dance

They still can sell the army
All the drugs that they can do
And all she wants to do is

All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

Well, we barely made the airport
For the last plane out
As we taxied down the runway
I could hear the people shout
They said, ""Don't come back here, Yankee""
But if I ever do
I'll bring more money
'Cause all she wants to do is dance
And make romance
Never mind the heat
Comin' off the street
She wants to party
She wants to get down
All she wants to do is
All she wants to do is dance
And make romance

I thought I knew you well
But all this time I could never tell
I let you get away
Haunts me every night and every day
You were the only one
The only friend that I counted on
How could I watch you walk away
I'd give anything to have you here today
But now I stand alone with my pride
And dream that you're still by my side

[Chorus]
But that was yesterday
I had the world in my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a slight change of plans

[Bridge]
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
No more hiding in yesterday
Because yesterday's gone

[Verse 2]
Love, my love I gave it all
Thought I saw the light
When I heard you call
Life that we both could share
Has deserted me
Left me in despair
But now I stand alone with my pride
Fighting back the tears I never let myself cry
[Chorus]
But that was yesterday
Love was torn from my hands
But it's not the end of my world
Just a little hard to understand

[Verse 3]
That was yesterday
But today life goes on
You won't find me in yesterday's world
Now yesterday's gone

Goodbye yesterday
Now it's over and done
Still I hope somewhere deep in your heart
Yesterday will live on"

Say you will sing your songs forevermore

You are on my mind
I've gotta have some time

Ooh, you're the ideal lady
That, you've got my heart and mind
Girl, you're drivin' me crazy
She's got those long legs streamlined

Look at that anatomy
The sweetest thing
That could ever be
Heaven knows
She was made for me
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
I can't explain
What she does to me

It must be some kind of chemistry

To perfect that I've ever seen

Another long and sleepless night
You need someone to hold you tight
Sometimes love don't know wrong from right
Another long and senseless
Fight was all you knew they're all the same
There's no one left to take the blame
What's behind this masquerade
How do we win these losing
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds we know they run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

[Chorus]
Only lonely, I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely, but I can't stop loving you
Only lonely, how much pain does it take?

[Verse 2]
It's getting sometimes I don't know
When to stop when to go
Sometimes we're so afraid to let it show
A stolen kiss so out of place
It wipes the smile right off your face
And when those feelings start
We let them go, let them go
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so deep
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you
[Chorus]
Only lonely, I can't stop hurting you
Only lonely, but I can't stop loving you
Only lonely, so tell me babe, how much pain
Can you take before your heart breaks?

[Verse 3]
I got this time bomb ticking in my head
This time I think she's gonna blow
How can I say get away
When I just can't let go
Games we play, words we say
Cutting wounds that run so
Leave it all behind you
Or someday love will find you

Walking on a Chinese Wall

Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall

Butterfly, spread
Your painted wings
For an answer
From the Ching

By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop

Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak

Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more
Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall

Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me

Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain

Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love

On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh, yeah
Watching for the coins to fall
(On the Chinese Wall)
Butterfly, spread your wings
From an answer from the Ching

Go to sleep but not to rest, oh, no

Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week

She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, ""She's hot""
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name

Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot

She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space

Then she grabbed me around my neck and pulled my head to hers
That's when I felt my blood pressure surges and blown
Take this fancy home where we'll never be all alone
And turn it out 'cause you're freak-a-ristic
She was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be, freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak, brilliant thing
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak-a-ristic thing

She's freak-a-ristic
Hypnotized me, mesmerized me
She's freak-a-ristic
Love the way she moves

She's just the finest thing
I had ever seen, fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me

She's freak-a-ristic
Ooh, she's fresh, she's fine
She's freak-a-ristic
Cannot get her off my mind

Looking at a darker day
Oh, I'm pulling the shades away from my eyes
It's true the moody manners come and go
And it's better that you never know

Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken

My ideas seem to frighten you
Are you really that afraid to move
Oh, I guess that it's your right to reason
I'm still dealing with a force that's so strong
The force is stringing us along

Some things are better left unsaid
Some strings are better left undone
Some hearts are better left unbroken
Some lives are better left untouched
Some lies are better off believed
Some words are better left unspoken
You're livin' a lie
It's only on the outside

Ooh, some things are better left

There was a time when you needed someone to hold on to
Someone to hold you, somebody who's always sincere
All alone, suddenly you see her

There's a change in the way that you're feeling tonight

I have a tale to tell
Sometimes, it gets so hard to hide it well

Too blind to see the writing on the wall

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

I've seen it once, I know the warm she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside, you can't take that from me

Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned

Will I ever have the chance again?

How would they hear the beating of my heart?
Will it grow cold, the secret that I hide? Will I grow old?
How will they hear? When will they learn? How will they know?

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all

How, how can it be that a love
Carved out of caring, fashioned by fate
Could suffer so hard
From the games played once too often?
But making mistakes
Is a part of life's imperfections
Born of the years
Is it so wrong to be human after all?

Drawn into the stream
Of undefined illusion
Those diamond dreams
They can't disguise the truth

That there is something about you
Baby so right
I wouldn't be without you baby tonight

If ever our love was concealed
No one can say that we didn't feel
A million things
And a perfect dream of life
Gone, fragile but free
We remain tender together
If not so in love
It's not so wrong
We're only human after all

These changing years
They add to your confusion
Oh and you need to hear
The time that told the truth

You knew I would surrender

608,1986,Billy Ocean,There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry),"[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder, by the look in your eye
When I'm standing besides, there's a fever burning deep inside
Is there another in your memory
Do you think of someone you hear that special melody?
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

[Chrous]
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)

[Verse 2]
I often wonder, how it could be
You loving me, two hearts in perfect harmony
I'll count the hours until that day
Rhapsody plays, a melody for you and me
Until the moment that you give your love to me
You're the one I care for, the one that I would wait for

[Chrous]
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you
Ooo-ooo-ooo
Ohhhhhhhhh-uuuuu

[Verse 3]
You're my desire
You take me higher
My love is like a river running so deep
I always stop and think of you especially
When the words of a love song
Touch the very heart of me

[Chrous]
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)
There'll be sad songs to make you cry
Love songs often do
They can touch the heart of someone new
Saying I love you (I love you)"
609,1986,George Michael,A Different Corner,"[Verse 1]
I'd say love was a magical thing
I'd say love would keep us from pain
Had I been there, had I been there
I would promise you all of my life
But to lose you would cut like a knife
So I don't dare, no I don't dare
Cause I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
And I'm so scared, I'm so scared

[Verse 2]
Take me back in time maybe I can forget
Turn a different corner and we never would have met
Would you care
I don't understand it, for you it's a breeze
Little by little you've brought me to my knees
Don't you care
No I've never come close in all of these years
You are the only one to stop my tears
I'm so scared of this love
And if all that there is, is this fear of being used
I should go back to being lonely and confused
If I could, I would, I swear"
610,1986,Journey,Be Good To Yourself,"[Verse 1]
Running out of self-control
Getting close to an overload
Up against a no win situation
Shoulder to shoulder, push and shove
I'm hangin' up my boxing gloves
I'm ready for a long vacation

[Chorus]
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire, caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself

[Verse 2]
When you can't give no more
They want it all but you gotta say no
I'm turning off the noise that makes me crazy
Lookin' back with no regrets
To forgive is to forget
I want a little peace of mind to turn to

[Chorus]
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will
Oh be good to yourself
You're walking a high wire, caught in a cross fire
Oh be good to yourself
[Outro]
Be good to yourself when, nobody else will"

Moving moving
Move away

Spirit changed the conversation
Stepping stones across the land
I never wanted to be a hero
I never wanted to be a man

I hurt you darling
I made you cry
I hurt you darling
Don't ask me why

Move move move away from me darling
I never said I'd hold your hand
Move move move away from me darling
I never said I'd understand

If I could say this was judgment day
You know I'd be a millionaire

I'm prepared to wear my sorrow
Everywhere we go in town
Ain't no need to beg or borrow
While you're there to drage me down
(Justice right)

I need you so
I can't let go

I never said I'd hold your hand
Why don't you move?"

You say I scare you, well that's your fear
I know the message my heart is sending
But you don't read it, you keep me guessing

Is it love, is it love you're after
Is it love, is it, is it love

The broken record goes round and round
Within a circle, without a sound
I'm under water, in overdrive
You hide in laughter, what's on your mind

Is it love, is it love you're after - why don't you tell me
Is it love, is it, is it love
Is it love, is it love you're after - why can't you tell me
Is it love, is it really love

Is it love, is it love you're after - why can't you tell me
Is it love, is it, is it love

Hey girl, I got to know, is it really, really love
Is it love, is it really love - hey
Is it love, is it love you're after - why don't you tell me

613,1986,Howard Jones,No One Is To Blame,"You can look at the menu
But you just can't eat
You can feel the cushions
But you can't have a seat

You can dip your foot in the pool
But you can't have a swim
You can feel the punishment
But you can't commit the sin

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame

You can build a mansion
But you just can't live in
You're the fastest runner
But you're not allowed to win

Some break the rules
And let you count the cost
The insecurity is the thing that won't get lost

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
You can see the summit
But you can't reach it
It's the last piece of the puzzle
But you just can't make it fit
Doctor says you're cured
But you still feel the pain
Aspirations in the clouds
But your hopes go down the drain

And you want her and she wants you
We want everyone
And you want her, and she wants you
No one, no one, no one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame
No one ever is to blame"

Through the pyramids of light
I would feed myself from silence
Wash it down with empty nights

Then your innocent distractions
Hit me so hard
My emotional reaction
Caught me off guard

It was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like anything I had felt before
And it was nothin' at all (nothin' at all)
Like I thought, no, it's so much more

No one else
Has ever made me feel this way
When I asked you how you did it
You just say
It was nothin' at all

Now, I walk home every evening
And my feet are quick to move
'Cause I know my destination
Is a warm and waiting you
From our first communication
It was clear
Any thought of moderation
Would soon disappear

Blackbird in the barn
Four hundred empty acres
That used to be my farm
Grew up like my daddy did
My grandpa cleared this land
When I was five
I walked the fence while Grandpa held my hand

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
There`s no legacy for you now

Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

The crops we grew last summer
Weren`t enough to pay the loans
Couldn`t buy the seed to plant this spring
And the Farmers' Bank foreclosed
Called my old friend Schepman
Up to auction off the land
He said:
""John, it`s just my job
And I hope you understand.""
Hey, calling it your job, ole hoss
Sure don`t make it right
But if you want me to
I`ll say a prayer for your soul tonight
And grandma`s on the front porch swing
With a Bible in her hand
Sometimes I hear her singing
Take me to the Promised Land
When you take away a man`s dignity
He can`t work his fields and cows

There`ll be
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
Blood on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow

There`s 97 crosses
Planted in the courthouse yard
Ninety-seven families who
Lost ninety-seven farms

I think about my grandpa
My neighbors and my name
And some nights
I feel like dying
Like that scarecrow in the rain
Rain on the scarecrow
Blood on the plow
This land fed a nation
This land made me proud
And son, I`m just sorry
They`re just memories for you now

626,1986,The Moody Blues,Your Wildest Dreams,"[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Reflected in your eyes

[Chorus 1]
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Verse 2]
Once the world was new
Our bodies felt the morning dew
That greets the brand-new day
We couldn't tear ourselves away

[Chorus 2]
I wonder if you care
I wonder if you still remember
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Bridge]
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time
[Verse 3]
Once beneath the stars
The universe was ours
Love was all we knew
And all I knew was you

[Chorus 3]
I wonder if you know
I wonder if you think about it
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

[Ad-libbed Interlude]

[Bridge]
And when the music plays
And when the words are touched with sorrow
When the music plays

And when the music plays
I hear the sound I had to follow
Once upon a time

[Verse 4]
Once upon a time
Once when you were mine
I remember skies
Mirrored in your eyes
[Chorus 3]
I wonder where you are
I wonder if you think about me
Once upon a time
In your wildest dreams

In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams
In your wildest dreams"
627,1986,Bob Seger,Like A Rock,"[Verse 1]
Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun
Felt like a million
Felt like number one
The height of summer
I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock

[Verse 2]
I was eighteen
Didn't have a care
Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare
But I was lean and
Solid everywhere
Like a rock

[Verse 3]
My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light
And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock
[Verse 4]
Like a rock, I was strong as I could be
Like a rock, nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock, I was something to see
Like a rock

[Verse 5]
And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud, I stood tall
High above it all
I still believed in my dreams

[Verse 6]
Twenty years now
Where'd they go?
Twenty years
I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone

[Verse 7]
And sometimes late at night
When I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
I recall
[Verse 8]
Like a rock, standin' arrow straight
Like a rock, chargin' from the gate
Like a rock, carryin' the weight
Like a rock

[Verse 9]
Like a rock, the sun upon my skin
Like a rock, hard against the wind
Like a rock, I see myself again
Like a rock"
628,1986,Van Halen,Why Can't This Be Love,"[Verse 1]
Oh here it comes
That funny feeling again
Winding me up inside
Every time we touch

Hey I don't know
Ooh tell me where to begin
Cause I never ever
Felt so much

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't recall
Any love at all
Baby this blows 'em all away

[Chorus]
It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love

Straight from my heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love

[Verse 2]
I tell myself
Hey only fools rush in
Only time will tell
If we stand the test of time
All I know
You've got to run to win
And I'll be damned ifI'll get
Hung up on the line

[Pre-Chorus]
No I can't recall
Anything at all
Baby this blows 'em all away

[Chorus]
It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love

You want it straight from the heart
Oh tell me why
Can't this be love

It's got what it takes
So tell me why
Can't this be love
Straight from my heart

Baby why
Can't this be love

Got to know why
Can't this be love

I wanna know why
Can't this be love"

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle & Arctic Monkeys]
I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of your buildin'
Sitting on the steps, feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' ""Bullet Proof Soul""
Every few shows, I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown, Diamond District, jewelers like, ""Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low""
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
Then docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, ""Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em""
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curved detectives
Guess it's evidence of a divine presence, blessings
Held me down, at times, I seem reckless, F it
You got an L, but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, then left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money Makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Snatch a champagne bottle from Rico's 'til T show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See, bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?

[Verse 2: Nipsey Hussle]
Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there
This time around, I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it, though, y'all niggas scared
Eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make 'em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mils
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
It's just another front step with candles
Lil' message from the set, ""We accept your challenge""

634,1986,GTR,When The Heart Rules The Mind,"Mother, protect me, protect me from myself
Lately I can't tell who really are my friends
Burning the candle, the candle at both ends
Through crowds, across floors, each night I just pretend

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past

Watching the actor that takes the stage by storm
Stealing the limelight while we're in the wings
Sometimes the hero must play the underdog
But I don't feel the same, I must have everything

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past

Seasons will change
You must move on
Follow your dream

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past
When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past

When the heart rules the mind
One look and love is blind
When you want the dream to last
Take a chance, forget the past

Seasons will change
You must move on
Follow your dream"
635,1986,The Dream Academy,The Love Parade,"Look out your window any day
From June to September the love parade's
Out on the street where you live and you know
It's just a matter of time before it takes over

They've been married for so many years
Now a young love seranade blows sweet nothing in her ear
They're lonely together, when they're not apart
It feels like she's holding on to someone else in the dark

Oh the love parade is on
Even against all odds
It'll go on forever
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade

But if he could put himself into a different skin
He'd be worrying about what he's let himself in for
Hanging in the air apparent
A point of view almost transparent

So you sold your soul for a pocket full of sweet talk
Forget-me-not kisses at the end of a slow walk
And when it's done you put your world back on
'Cause she's otherwise engaged married to someone
Oh the love parade goes on
Even when you're gone
It'll go on forever
The love parade
Only matinee shows
The love parade"

Once upon a time in a land called Fantasy
Seventeen mountains stood so high
The sea surrounded them and together they would be
The only thing that ever made you cry
You said the devil told you that another mountain would appear
Every time somebody broke your heart
He said the sea would one day overflow with all your tears
And love will always leave you lonely

[Chorus]
But I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe, oh yeah
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, uh huh, than you and me

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time in a haystack of despair
Happiness sometimes hard to find (yeah)
Africa divided, hijack in the air
It's enough to make you want to lose your mind

[Chorus]
And I say it's only mountains and the sea
Love will conquer if you just believe, oh yeah
It's only mountains and the sea
There's nothing greater, uh huh, than you and me
Guitars and drums on the one!
Bobby on the drum-ah
It's only mountains
Oh yeah
And the sea
And the girls say
There's nothing greater, oh no, than you and me

Don't think about tomorrow

647,1986,Psychedelic Furs,Pretty In Pink,"Caroline laughs and it's raining all day
She loves to be one of the girls
She lives in the place in the side of our lives
Where nothing is ever put straight
She turns herself 'round and she smiles and she says
'This is it, that's the end of the joke'
And loses herself in her dreaming and sleep
And her lovers walk through in their coats
She's pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?

All of her lovers all talk of her notes
And the flowers that they never sent
And wasn't she easy?
Isn't she pretty in pink?
The one who insists he was first in the line
Is the last to remember her name
He's walking around in this dress that she wore
She is gone, but the joke's the same

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Caroline talks to you softly sometimes
She says 'I love you' and 'too much'
She doesn't have anything you want to steal
Well, nothing you can touch
She waves
She buttons your shirt
The traffic is waiting outside, she hands you this coat
She gives you her clothes, these cars collide

Pretty in pink
Isn't she?
Pretty in pink
Isn't she?"

No, baby

Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
What fate is going to blow
Your way just hope that it feels right

Sometimes it comes and it goes
You take it ever so slow
And then you lose it
Then it flows right to you

So we rely on the past
Special moments that last
Were they as tender
As we dare to remember

Such a fine time as this
What could equal the bliss
The thrill of the first kiss
It'll blow right to you

It's never as good as the first time
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)
Good times they come and they go
Never going to know
It's like the weather
One day chicken, next day feathers

The rose we remember
The thorns we forget
We'd love and leave
We never spend a minute on regret

It is a possibility, the more we know the less we see
Second time, is not quite what it seems
Natural as the way we came to be
The second time, won't live up to the dream

It's never as good as the first time (Never as good)
It's never as good as the first time
(Never as good as the first time)

Natural as the way we came to be
Second time won't live up to the dream
It's natural as the way we came to be
The second time is not quite what it seems

It's never, ooh, as good as the first time

I would never leave you alone

Sometimes I just forget
Say things I might regret
It breaks my heart to see you crying
I don't wanna lose you
I could never make it alone

I am a man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you're dreaming of
We'll live forever
Knowing together
That we did it all for the glory of love

You keep me standing tall
You help me through it all
I'm always strong when you're beside me
I have always needed you
I could never make it alone

I am the man who will fight for your honor
I'll be the hero you've been dreaming of

Just in time I will save the day
Take you to my castle far away

Silently take my hand
Nobody knows what's inside us
Nobody understands
They handed us down a dream
To live in this lonely town
But nobody hears the music
Only the echo of a hollow sound

Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away

Together we make our way
Passengers on a train
Whisper a secret forever
Promises in the rain
We're leaving it all behind
While castles are falling down
We're going where no one can find us
And if there's a heaven
We'll find it somehow

Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away"

You soon turn back
It happens time and time again
You never seem to reach the end
Someone's out there on the street tonight
When things go wrong
He'll guarantee to make them right
If the price is right

Every time I look you're fallin' fallin'
Beaten by the wind
Every time I turn around he's there again

It's like a full force gale
An American storm
You're buried far beneath a mountain of cold
And you never get warm
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge `em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You never feel the need

Everybody casts a certain light
A special gift
It's theirs to use for wrong or right
When you face the night
More and more we choose the easy way
We take no risks
We figure out which games to play
And how to make 'em pay
Suddenly the pressure's fallin' fallin'
Skies have all turned grey
Suddenly the storm is heading straight your way

It's like a full force gale
Atop a mountain of cold
You tell your story again and again
And it never gets old
It's like a wall of mirrors
You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass
But you never bleed
You face a full force gale
An American storm
You're buried beneath a mountain of cold
And you never get warm - no you never get warm

You charge 'em at full speed
You cover up - you hear the shattering glass

You never feel the need"

I had champagne milkshake for breakfast
But I know where I'll sleep tonight
I've got a blue-eyed earthquake--she's lyin' in my bed
Ain't it a wonderful life

Push me, pull me, never get a minute to yourself
Pure hell, get you if you let it, stand up, sit down

Sunday morning, break of dawn
And I don't think I've slept at all
I toss and turn and body's yearning
Thinking 'bout you all night long

Feel the thunder in my heart beating
It's tearing me apart
I won't rest until you're here beside me
Sharing my love through the night

I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
I can't live without your love

I tried to fight it, tried to hide it
Just another passing flame, well
Here today and gone tomorrow
But with you the fire raged

Over my mind, body and soul baby
You took complete control
I'm on the verge of going crazy maybe
You're all I want
Don't you leave me in the cold
I'm restless, I can't sleep a wink
Can't live without your love

To handsome men in overcoat
Deception right in front of me
A jealous fantasy

Whoa, something that sets you apart
Tightens your grip on my heart
Don't ever let it go

Till I feel it again
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end
To feel it again (to feel it again)
I thought that this heart would never mend
To feel it again, I know it is the living end

Is people will come and people will go
I don't really care (to feel it again)

As long as you're there

Of my heart and soul

Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice
That's when I know I want you

Losing all my defenses
You're slipping back
Inside of my head
It's getting so I can't
Exist without the thought
Of us together again

Rolling me over

When I feel your touch
Then I know I want you
Then I know I want you

It's been so uncertain
Ties were broken
And it left me hurting
Maybe now I can
Trust again with you

And it's taking over
Rolling me over
Seems like it won't stop
And I've lost control
Of my heart and soul

Cause when I see your eyes
Then I know I want you
When I hear your voice

694,1986,Jackson Browne,In The Shape Of A Heart,"It was a ruby that she wore
On a chain around her neck
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
It was a time I won't forget
For the sorrow and regret
And the shape of a heart
And the shape of a heart

I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of belief and belonging
Try to fit some name to their longing
People speak of love

There was a hole left in the wall
From some ancient fight
About the size of a fist
Or something thrown that had missed
And there were other holes as well
In the house where our nights fell
Far too many to repair
In the time that we were there
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Reach out to each other through the push and shove
Speak in terms of a life and the learning
Try to think of a word for the burning

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
What breaches and faults are concealed
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart

It was the ruby that she wore
On a stand beside the bed
In the hour before dawn
When I knew she was gone
And I held it in my hand
For a little while
Dropped it into the wall
I let it go and heard it fall

I guess I never knew
What she was talking about
I guess I never knew
What she was living without
People speak of love don't know what they're thinking of
Wait around for the one who fits just like a glove
Speak in terms of a life and the living
Try to find the word for forgiving

You keep it up
You try so hard
To keep a life from coming apart
And never know
The shallows and the unseen reefs
That are there from the start
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart
In the shape of a heart"

Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, yeah

Get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on

You say you still care for me
But your heart and soul needs to be free
And now that you've got your freedom
You wanna still hold on to me
You don't want me for yourself
So let me find somebody else

Set me free why don't cha, babe?
Get out my life why don't cha, babe? (wooh)
'Cause you don't really love me
You just keep me hangin' on
Why don't cha be a man about it
And set me free? (wooh)
Now you don't care a thing about me
You're just using me, hey, abusing me

Get out, get out of my life
And let me sleep at night (wooh)

Today started with a crazy kiss
On our way home
We were in for a surprise
Who would have known?

Who would have thought
That we would become lovers?
As friends we were so, so tight
Can't help myself
You make me feel so right

Got to tell you, darling

Gone tomorrow
It's possible
But I doubt it
His kiss is credit in the bank of love
I never leave home without it

Bedroom eyes
Head back to the side
Please don't be so mean

I've never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
I've never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance
Given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

[Chorus]
The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

[Verse 2]
I've never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
I've never seen you shine so bright
You were amazing
I've never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled
It took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love
As I do tonight

The lady in red is dancing with me
Cheek to cheek
There's nobody here
It's just you and me
It's where I want to be

It started me thinking, wondering
What I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting
Asking all kinds of questions to myself but never finding the answers

Crying at the top of my voice and no one listening
All this time, I still remember everything you said
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget

[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep

So listen, listen to me
Ooh, you must believe me
I can feel your eyes go through me
But I don't know why

Ooh, I know you're going but I can't believe
It's the way that you're leaving
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to

I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget
[Chorus]
Listen, you know I love you but I just can't take this
You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this
You know I want to but I'm in too deep
So listen, listen to me
I can feel your eyes go through me

It seems I've spent too long
Only thinking about myself, oh
Now I want to spend my life
Just caring bout somebody else

You know I love you but I'm playing for keeps
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive

Where one man's nightmare is another man's dream
Pull the covers up high and pray for the mornin' light
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night
Met a man with a message from the other side
Couldn't take the pressure - had to leave it behind
He said it's up to you
You can run or you can fight - (ya that's right)
Better leave it alone in the heat of the night

In the heat of the night they'll be comin' around
They'll be lookin' for answers they'll be chasin' you down
In the heat of the night
(Where you gonna hide when it all comes down)
(Don't look back don't ever turn around)

Had to pay the piper to call the tune
Said he'd be back someday - said he'd be back real soon
Pull the shades down low - you'll know when the time is right
When you're lyin' alone in the heat of the night"

I was thinking about her
Visiting the past
Reconstructing details with old photographs
Studying the faces
With an objective point of view
Suddenly remembering doesn't haunt me
At the time you couldn't tell me
That one day I'd be glad
That something that I thought was love was misinterpreted
She had another lover, she emphatically denied
But they were doing me a favor
A blessing in disguise

If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true
Then I would've been cheated
I would never know real love
I would've missed out on you

I watch you sleeping, your body touching me
There's no doubt about it
This is where I want to be
You know it's so ironic, I had to lose to win
I want to thank her (Thank her again)

If she would have been faithful
If she could have been true

I've been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me

All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
For lessons in love

For restless eyes, egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard

Heavy hearts, token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love
Lost without love

Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn

Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait 'till you return

All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
(Lessons in love)
For lessons in love

All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah

Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must have been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight

[Verse 1]
I keep looking for something I can't get
Broken hearts lie all around me
And I don't see an easy way to get out of this
Her diary, it sits by the bedside table
The curtains are closed, the cats in the cradle
Who would've thought that a boy like me could come to this

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

[Verse 2]
Is there any just cause for feeling like this?
On the surface, I'm a name on a list
I try to be discreet, but then blow it again
I've lost and found, it's my final mistake
She's loving by proxy, no give and all take
Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy one too many times
[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been some kind of kiss
I should've walked away, I should've walked away

[Bridge]
It was a long hot night
She made it easy, she made it feel right
But now it's over the moment has gone
I followed my hands not my head, I know I was wrong

[Guitar Solo]

[Hook]
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said

I'm in Heaven
Listen

[Verse 1]
Pay attention, are you listening?
You're my favorite girl
Excuse me for the moment
I'm in another world
On a mountain, by a fountain
Flowers blooming everywhere
With Venus and with cupid
The picture's very clear

[Hook]
Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove

[Verse 2]
Erotic whispers for the listener
Let the music fill the air
Excuse me for a moment
I'm at a loss for words
By election, sheer perfection
And as if these eyes would care
Your heart is in the right place
So don't you go and change
Baby over and over
The passion starts again
You're my lollipops and everything
And a little taste of sin
Causing fire and desire
In this mortal soul to live
'Til the angels fall from Heaven
And the day the earth stands still
[Hook]
Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove

[Interlude]
When it feels so real, don't disturb this groove

[Bridge]
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the mood
Can you feel it? (Uh huh)
Baby, just lock the door and turn the phone off
This time, it's time for me and you
Are you ready? (Yes)

[Hook]
Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'
Just a way to say that, I'm so into you
And the feeling's so real, so don't disturb this groove

[Outro]
Close your eyes and let the music put you in the groove
Lock the door and turn the phone off, it's time for me and you
Hang the sign upon the door, say, 'Don't disturb this groove'"

The sun would set so high
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, te amo
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Can make you run for cover

Bring life to frozen ground

Could carry us away

Could carry us today

Turning in my sleep
Love can leave you cold
A taste of jealousy
Is like a lust for gold

Something so strong
Could carry us away
Something so strong
Could carry us today

I've been
Feeling so much older
Frame me
And hang me on the wall
I've seen
You fall into the same trap

Just when it grows

Whoa oh, whoa oh, oh oh, oh oh

Just what it takes
When things ain't good enough
I just pull the brake

Sometimes it's easy
Sometimes so tough
But just have one thing clear
I can't get enough

Running out of thrills

738,1987,Partland Brothers,Soul City,"Boy, you're looking great
Yeah, you got what it takes alright
There's life outside your window, babe
Step into the moonlight

Babe, we're gonna ride far outta this town
Driving into the setting sun
To be there with you
Dancing to the sound of our hearts beating as one

Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone

Man, this place is hopping
Dancing, singing, talking, rocking this town
Nobody down
Shake it with me, fake it with me
Don't ever take this feeling from my heart, just getting ready to start

Babe, I can see you don't ever wanna leave
Gonna do what's never been done
To be here with you
Dancing to the sound of our hearts beating as one
Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone

Soul City
That's where we're heading
Dancing and singing 'til dawn
Soul City
That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone

All of you who are looking for that rush tonight
Who are desperately searching for their heart
You wanna let go, there's one thing you'll know
That distant city is some place to start

That's where we're going
And we won't be back 'til the money's all gone"
739,1987,T'Pau,Heart And Soul,"Something in the moonlight catches my eye
The shadow of a lover goes dancing by
Looking for a little bit of love to grow, so
Give me love, give me heart and soul
You never let me cross to the other side now
I'm tied to the hope that you will somehow
Hard on the heels of something more
But I lost your love, heart and soul

The tear in my heart as you walk on by (more than an ocean)
I feel so low and your head is high
Everything you do convinces me more, please (keeps us apart)
Give me love, give me heart and soul
Looking to the day when I saw your face (I feel a tearing in half of my heart)
I wasn't in the running, I wasn't in the race
You move in a way that I've known before
Now I want your love, heart and soul

Leaving you ain't easy now (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
Loving you's the harder part (On the bed, on the pillow, where the love has died)
You never want me for myself (A turn of the key, through the door you go)
Now I've needed you right from the very start (Don't look back, to hurt me more )
(Everything you said was to the point)
Oh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)

Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul
Walking on the water, walking on the air (a walk on the water)
That was the heart of the love we shared
Do you keep secret left untold (is all that I need)
Can't give love, heart or soul
I used to have a lover with a Midas touch (but miracles are not happening)
I turned to gold but he turned to dust
Left me for another, I turned to stone
Now give me love, heart and soul

Living in a fantasy (Tired eyes, tears that dried)
There's never any room to breathe (On the bed, on the pillow, where you told your lies)
Hoping every waking hour (A turn of the key, my blood runs cold)
You'll turn around and say that we can start (Don't look back to hurt me more)
(Everything you did just said it all)
Oh won't you even try to (Can't you try to)

Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit of heart and soul

Somehow, I lost my way
Looking to see something in your eyes
But love will never compromise
Now this is the politics of life, yeah!
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit, little bit

Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know
A little bit, little bit

Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
Give a little bit of love to grow
Give a little bit of heart and soul (give a little bit of heart and soul)
And don't you make me beg for more (must I beg you)
Give a sign, I need to know, whoooah!
Give a little bit of heart and soul
Give a little bit of heart and soul"

Talking to yourself se la, se la
Talking to everybody, yeah se la, se la

There is freedom within, there is freedom without
Try to catch a deluge in a paper cup
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost
But you'll never see the end of the road
While you're traveling with me

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof
In the paper today, tales of war and of waste
But you turn right over to the TV page

Hey now, hey now, don't dream it's over
Hey now, hey now, when the world comes in
They come, they come to build a wall between us
We know they won't win

And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart
Only shadows ahead, barely clearing the roof
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release

And even if our love has drifted away
I wouldn't even think twice if I wanted love back again

755,1987,Gino Vannelli,Wild Horses,"As the sun goes down on the Arizona plain
And the wind whistles by like a runaway train
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful thing
Well it's me and you and a flatbed truck
My heart kicking over like a whitetail buck
Hey hey hey in the middle of spring

You can cut me deep
You can cut me down
You can cut me loose
Don't you know it's okay
You can kick and scream
You can slap my face
You can set my wheels on a high speed chase
Hey no matter what you do

Wild horses could not drag me away from you
Wild horses could not drag me away from you

As the sky falls down from the midnight blue
Spittin' like bullets on a hot tin roof
Hey hey hey it's a beautiful sound
Well it's me and you in a flatbed truck
In a foot of mud just my luck
Hey hey hey a hundred miles out of town
You can call me a fool
You can call me blind
You can call it quits
Can't hear a word you say
'cause if I had you once
I'm gonna have you twice
I'm gonna follow my heart instead of good advice
Hey no matter what you do

Wild horses could not drag me away from you
Wild horses could not drag me away from you"
756,1987,Debbie Gibson,Only In My Dreams,"[Verse 1:]
Everytime I'm telling secrets
I remember how it used to be
And I realized how much I miss you
And I realize how it feels to be free

Now I see I'm up to no good
(No, no good)
And I wanna start again
Can't remember when I felt good
(Felt good, baby)
No, I can't remember when

[Chorus:]
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

[Verse 2:]
Couldn't see how much I missed you
(Now I do)
Couldn't see how much it meant (ahh)
Now I see my world come tumbling down
(Tumbling down my world)
Now I see the road is bent
If I only once could hold you
(No, no, no)
And remember how it used to be (ahh)
If only I could scold you
And forget how it feels to be free

[Chorus:]
No, only in my dreams
As real as it may seem
It was only in my dreams

No
No, no, no, only in my dreams

I begged to stay
Wasn't it you
Who just laughed in my face
Maybe it's true
I'm not your kind
The kind you leave behind

And wasn't it you
All dressed in red
Clutchin' your suitcase
Never mind what you said
Suddenly you
Comin' round again
And you want to know how
I've been

Wot's it to you
Wot's it to you
You don't care for me
Or do you forget
Wot's it to ya
I see through ya
You only want something
That you can't get
Didn't I try
All day long
Didn't I try
When all hope was gone
Didn't I cry
Didn't I walk the floor
No cry, no more

Didn't I wait
All concerned
Wishin' and prayin'
Your love would return
Now isn't it her
Who I can't resist
And now you're wonderin'
Who she is

Repeat Chorus"
758,1987,Cameo,Back And Forth,"There's a special kind of person
Sometimes she's not all she seems
You only see what she wants you to see
And before you really know it always seems to go

Back & forth 8x (Our love goes)

Take your chances if you will (love's looks can kill)
It'll make you go round & around
You got to know it by now
That the truth is you just can't win
Love's funny like that
It'll make you blow your cap
Sacrifice everything and money
Love has no guarantees
It'll always really be

Back & forth 16 x(Oh, well, what'cha gonna do)

Take stabs dip and dab
Forever tryin to find your way
It's a seller's lament
For all the love you spent
You must have thought it was a bottomless pit
You can't do it like that
Love will show you where it's at
What you put up you'll surely get back
Cause there's no other way
If you play you'll pay
Back & forth 8x
Guitar solo
Love has no guarantees
It'll always really be
Back & forth 16 x out"
759,1987,REO Speedwagon,Variety Tonight,"If ever you think you miss the thrill of the chase
Or just get tired of the same old face
I can be different honey, I can be new
Want someone else, I can be that too

Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey if you want it, variety tonight
Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey you got it, variety tonight

The faces of love have their smiles and frowns
And every romance has its ups and downs
There are cases when love has been less than sweet
Love without hate is a little like light without heat

Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey if you want it, variety tonight
Whoa-oh, gonna make you feel right, honey you got it, variety tonight

And the fire will fade if you forget it
'Cause love can't live unless you let it
Whoa, you gotta try just a little harder with the passin' days
You got to find some new ways, ow!

Pour out of me
There must be a river

Waiting for you in vain

You got a ticket to take me all the way
Weatherman says it's gonna get hot tonight
There's a fever in the air that I can't control
Now I'm gonna be a fool for love
But I think it's all right
And I never wanna let this feeling go
Weatherman says it's gonna get hot tonight
And I'm gonna fill this burnin' desire
And I'm gonna get lost in love
'Cause I feel so right
Baby, I'll raise this flame into a fire
Lost my vision trying to read the writing on the wall
Caught in fatal fascination
Heading for a fall
Sweet shining summer angel came to my rescue
Shook off all that old suspicion
Found a dream come true

Not to let the hurdles sap my energy
Time will tell and time is all it takes
You won't see the bastards knock the running out of me

And the band, they played one more song
One for the mocking bird, they played one more song
All the tears, they fell one by one
All for the mocking-bird, they fell one by one

Don't be fooled by those who feed you words
They just twist and tighten up the tourniquet
But the sweetest song of all the mocking-birds
Couldn't hope to match one note of any song we played

And the band, they played one more song
One for the mocking bird, they played one more song
All the dreams, they broke one by one
All for the mocking-bird, they broke one by one

What are you hiding from?
Why do you lock the door?
Open up the door!

And the band, they played...
I have learnt, time will tell, years will pass, tears will fall
Don't be fooled, fed by words, their sweet songs

Would you remember
To tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
Hey, hey, when I was your man

If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can, oh
Only best friends can

If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend

[Verse 3]
If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out
Not that you're helpless
But sometimes, sometimes
Those are the things that bein' in love's about
[Verse 4]
If I was your one and only friend
Would you run to me if somebody hurt you
Even if that somebody was me?
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
Please

[Refrain]
If I was your girlfriend
Uh-ah, oooh-hoo-hoo
If I was your girlfriend

[Breakdown]
Would you let me wash your hair?
Could I make you breakfast sometime?
Or then, could we just hang out, I mean
Could we go to a movie and cry together?
'Cause to me, baby, that would be so fine

[Verse 5]
(If I was your girlfriend)
Baby can I dress you?
I mean, help you pick out your clothes
Before we go out

Those are the things that bein' in love's about

[Breakdown]
Sugar, do you know what I'm saying to you this evening?
(Sugar)
Maybe you think I'm being
A little self-centered
(If I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want to be
(Sugar)
All of the things you are to me
(If I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see

[Spoken Outro]
Is it really necessary for me to go out of the room just because you wanna undress?
(If I was your girlfriend)
I mean, we don't have to make children to make love
And we don't have to make love to have an orgasm
(If I was your girlfriend)
Your body's what I'm all about
(If I was your girlfriend)
Can I see you?
I'll show you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Why not?
You can think it's because I'm your friend I'll do it for you
(If I was your girlfriend)
Of course I'll undress in front of you!
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
(If I was your girlfriend)
How can I make you see that it's cool?
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could
(If I was your girlfriend)
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, for you naked I would dance a ballet
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
(If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh
And would you, would you let me kiss you there
(If I was your girlfriend)
You know down there where it counts
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long
(If I was your girlfriend)
And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try to imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try to imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try"

Oh yeah

[Verse 1]
In France a skinny man died of a big disease with a little name
By chance his girlfriend came across a needle and soon she did the same
At home there are seventeen-year-old boys and their idea of fun Is being in a gang called The Disciples, high on crack, totin' a machine gun
Time, times

[Verse 2]
Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling of a church and killed everyone inside
You turn on the telly and every other story is tellin' you somebody died
My sister killed her baby 'cause she couldn't afford to feed it
And we're sending people to the moon
In September my cousin tried reefer for the very first time
Now he's doing horse, it's June
Times, times

[Chorus]
It's silly, no?
When a rocket ship explodes
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy
Unless a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Time, time
[Verse 3]
Baby make a speech, star wars fly
Neighbors just shine it on
But if a night falls and a bomb falls
Will anybody see the dawn
Time, times

[Chorus]
Is it silly, no?
When a rocket blows up
And everybody still wants to fly
Some say a man ain't happy, truly
Until a man truly dies
Oh, why?
Oh, why?
Sign o' the Times
Time, time

Sign o' the times mess with your mind
Hurry before it's too late
Let's fall in love, get married, have a baby
We'll call him Nate, if it's a boy

Broken hearts behind her

Where no shadow's cast

And in her laughter
There's no hint of compromise

Into the fire forever
You can squeeze a stone
Until it bleeds
But you will never find
The kind of love she needs

Too much, too late

A fool to think she'd wait

Right beside you

Down at the hive where you're such a busy bee
So sign in honey, sign up for heaven
Just you tonight, it's you and me

Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all

There'll be a high time, high time at the lakeside
Barry and the boys are going in for free
We'll jump the moon, take it for a joyride
I stuck it up there for you and me

Come as you are, now come on
Come as you are, and we'll have a ball
Ain't gonna be no masquerade
Come as you are, or don't come at all

I'm just a bluebird, bluebird at your window
And it's for sure, you're a pretty sight to see
But life's so short and I know what you're into
Come it's you and me

Come as you are, now come on

799,1987,Kool & The Gang,Stone Love,"Girl, the first time we met
You took me by surprise
Ooh, girl you walked into my life
With those street corner blues

You were livin' in the fast lane
Much to my surprise baby
But I fell for you, anyway
I'm addicted to your love girl, hey

Stone love (solid as a rock)
I'm in love with you baby, stone love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, solid as a rock)

Girl, our love is so unique
It's one of a kind
And girl, whenever we kiss
It's like a natural high

But we're livin' in the fast lane
Red lights flashing baby
Will we ever change the way we are
Stone love girl, oh

Stone love
(Solid as a rock)
Stone Love
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, solid as a rock)
The life we live is a challenge, mmm
Always standing on the edge
May not be the best way but that's all we know

Oh, stone love baby, cause I've got you
Yes I've got you got you under my skin
Hey, stone love (solid as a rock)
That's the way we are, baby
Hey, stone love (solid as a rock)

I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm lookin' out for angels
Just tryin' to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me
Say you love me
But if you don't
Just let me go

[Chorus]
'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

[Verse 2]
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me ""No""
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go

'Cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine

Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride

Ain't what she's looking for

So much for your promises
They died the day you let me go
Caught up in a web of lies
But it was just too late to know

Who would stand by my side

And now you've given me, given me
Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away
From this empty heart

You said you'd die for me

And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right

804,1988,Samantha Fox,Naughty Girls (Need Love Too),"[Intro:]
Maybe
Just maybe
Naughty girls need love too

[Verse 1:]
I've been told time and time again
That you can't treat love like a game
But I play rough
With hearts that never mend
'Cause some guys like you do the same

Love
Was just a four letter word
Never heard
How absurd
How it could be

But now
I can't believe this is real
How I feel now you steal
My heart away from me

Used to be so good and so bad
Sex was just something I had
Used to always know what to do
Now you've got me confused
[Chorus:]
Baby, don't let me be misunderstood
Temporary love's so bad
But it feels so good

Then along came you
Now I know it's true
Naughty girls need love too

Then came you
Then came you

[Verse 2:]
Yes, it's true
I'm in love with you
And believe it, baby
This time your love won't get away

Stay here in the place to be
We can get busy my way
For six forevers and a day

Ooh, it's only you I adore
So much more
Than my body was asking for
Yes
Your love is breaking my chill
Even still there's a thrill in my heart

[Full Force:]
Samantha Fox was such a wild dame
Huh
But what's in a name?
(S-S-Samantha, S-S-Samantha Fox)
No more fun and games of the mind
Let's get busy one time

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

So moving like you're forty
This groove is much too naughty
Can't you see
I want you just for me
Boys, make some noise

[Full Force:]
Girl, I want to shower you with diamonds
And please don't tease
If you lie my heart will freeze
Freeze, freeze, freeze
Don't let me, baby
Temporary love's so bad
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you
Then along came you

Don't, don't
Don't, don't
Temporary, temporary
Temporary, temporary
Came along, came along
Came along, came along
Naughty girls need love

Baby, baby
Don't let me
Temporary love's so bad
Then along came you"
805,1988,Debbie Gibson,Foolish Beat,"[Verse 1]
There was a time when
Broken hearts and broken dreams
Were over
There was a place where
All you could do was
Wish on a four leaf clover

But now is a new time
There is a new place
Where dreams just can't come true
It started the day when I left you

[Chorus]
I could never love again the way that I loved you
I could never cry again like I did when I left you
And when we said goodbye
Oh the look in your eyes
Just left me beside myself without your heart
(Without your heart)
I could never love again now that we're apart

[Verse 2]
When I was sorry
It was too late to turn around
And tell you so
There was no reason
There was no reason
Just a foolish beat of my heart
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you see I'm not fooling nobody
Don't you see the tears are falling down my face?
Since you went away
Break my heart, you slipped away
Didn't know I was wrong
Never meant to hurt you now you're gone

I could never love again now that we're apart
(Now that we're apart)
I could never love again now that we're apart"

Tonight it's been a year
We met each other here
Here I am all alone
As thoughts of you go on

Hear me crying out to you
You said
Never, never
Would I leave

Here's a tear
From me to you
And maybe it will make you hear me

[Chorus:]
I loved you
You didn't feel the same
Though we're apart

You're in my heart
Give me one more chance to
Make it real

In a dream you are here
You smile and hold me near
And in my heart
I'll pretend
That you are here again

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need.""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: ""There's no turning back.""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: ""That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star.""

'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said: ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright.""
Diana walked up to me
She said: ""I'm all yours tonight.""
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright.""
I said: ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key.""
She said: ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me.""

809,1988,Bruce Hornsby & The Range,The Valley Road,"Sometimes I lead, sometimes I follow
This time I'll go where she wants me to go
She said maybe today, maybe tomorrow
Deep in the woods down the low valley road

While no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He took her all the way down the long valley road
They sent her away not too much later
And left him walking down the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on alone, alone

Out in the hall, they were talking in a whisper
Everybody noticed she was gone awhile
Somebody said she's gone to her sister's
Everybody knew what they were talking about

Whoa, while no one was lookin' on the old plantation
He showed her what they do down the long valley road
She came back around like nothing really happened
And left him standing on the old valley road
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on, on the valley road
Standing like a stone on the old plantation
The rich old man would have never let him in
Good enough to hire, not good enough to marry
When it all happens, nobody wins
Walk on
Walk on, walk on alone
Walk on, walk on
Walk on, walk on alone, alone"

Nobody, nowhere, holds the key to your heart
When love's a possession, it'll tear you apart
You may have lovers wherever you roam
But sooner or later
Ooh, we all sleep alone

Oh, the young and the young at heart wait
But the wait never ends in the soul
When you feel love is all gone away
Independence has come
And into the night I go

Don't make no promises that I can't keep
I won't be no prisoner of somebody's needs
You may have lovers wherever you roam

I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance
No, no, no, no, no, no
I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together

If we believe that true love
Never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again

Find ourselves in love again

I went to a party last Saturday night
I didn't get laid
I got in a fight
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

Late for my job
And the traffic was bad
Had to borrow ten bucks from my old man
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

I went to a party last Saturday night
I told you that story
It'd be alright
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
Kiss me once
Kiss me twice
C'mon, pretty baby
Kiss me deadly
[Verse 2:]
Had a few beers
Getting high
Sitting, watching the time go by
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

Nothing to eat and no TV
Looking in the mirror
Don't get it for me
Uh, huh
It ain't no big thing

But I know what I like
I know I like dancing with you
And I know what you like
I know you like dancing with me
Oh, yeah

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

[Bridge:]
You know I like dancing with you
Dancing with you
C'mon

Kiss me once
Kiss me twice

Now listen

Not a dime, I can't pay my rent
I can barely make it through the week
Saturday night I wanna do my girl
Right now I can't make ends meet

I'm always workin', slavin' everyday
Gotta get a break from same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
You can hear me think, this is what I'd say

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better
Oh I feel get better and

Spend my money on women and wine
I couldn't tell you where I spent last night
Really sorry about the shape I'm in
Just like my fun, every now and then

I'm always workin', slavin' every day
Gotta get a break from same ol', same ol'
I need a chance just to get away
You can hear me think, this is what I'd say
Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better
All you do to me, oh look it down

You see I raise a toast to all of us
You're busting your ass every day
If wantin' the good life is such a crime
Lord, then put me away, here's to ya

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better, sing it

Don't need nothin' but a good time
How can I resist?
Ain't lookin' for nothin' but a good time
And it don't get better"

818,1988,Gloria Estefan & Miami Sound Machine,Anything For You,"Anything for you
Though you're not here
Since you said we're through
It seems like years
Time keeps dragging on and on
And forever's been and gone
Still I can't figure what went wrong

I'd still do anything for you
I'll play your game
You hurt me through and through
But you can have your way

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though you'll never see me crying
You know inside I feel like dying

And I'd do anything for you
In spite of it all
I've learned so much from you
You made me strong

But don't you ever think that
I don't love you
That for one minute
I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye
I hope you find someone to please you
Someone who'll care and never leave you
But if that someone ever hurts you
You just might need a friend to turn to

And I'd do anything for you
I'll give you up
If that's what I should do
To make you happy

I can pretend each time I see you
That I don't care
And I don't need you
And though inside I feel like dying
You know you'll never see me crying

Don't you ever think that
I don't love you
That for one minute I forgot you
But sometimes things don't work out right
And you just have to say goodbye"

I fall nearer to the ground
It seems that I've been looking for
Something that won't be found

I was only Dreaming
I was only trying to catch your eye
I was only wishing you would notice me
Instead you said goodbye

Could this be the new answer then
To all the dreams we've made
Could there be some solution please
To rid me of this grace
But every single second that you held me in your arms
You build me up
You raise me up
You kill me with your charms

I was only Dreaming
I was only trying to catch your eye
I was only wishing you would notice me
Instead you said goodbye
Would you stay with me tonight
Won't you make these feelings last
Can we start this all again
Would that be just to much to ask

I was only Dreaming
I was only trying to catch your eye
I was only wishing you would notice me
Instead you said goodbye..."

Promises in vain

But in disguise
What happens now
Do we break another rule?
Let our lovers play the fool?

To stop feeling this way

Hold on to the nights
Hold on to the memories
If only I could give you more

Is right there

Just being with you

You take me to the Rush Hour
You got me in the Rush Hour

Feel me getting close to you dear

Now your lips are touching mine
And in your eyes that certain shine
Honey, I know just where you're taking me

So raise your hands to heaven
And pray
That we'll be back together someday

Tonight
I need your sweet caress
Hold me in the darkness
Tonight
You calm my restlessness
You relieve my sadness

As we move to embrace
Tears run down your face
I whisper words of love so softly
I can't believe this pain
It's driving me insane
Without your touch
Life will be lonely

Morning has come
Another day
I must pack my bags
And say goodbye
Goodbye

It's a room without a view
But all that could change if I just get through, up to you

And now I begin to see that I should
Dare to fall and with your help tear down the walls

Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah

And so, here I am with no disguise
You're not the only one who's surprised

Strange but true, I've really got a thing for you, yeah

I ain't gonna look much further now
And I ain't gonna try to reason how
'Cause I know if this turns into love

Maybe I should dare to fall

And we had a fight
And it seemed like nothing
Was going right
Then you turned around
And you walked
Right out the door
Now it`s not the first time
It`s not the last
I know all about
Your checkered past
And we played this game
One thousand times before
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate
And I`m not the type
To just sit and wait
I`ve made up my mind
I can`t wait for you anymore
But when we kiss
It feels like this
And when we touch
It means so much
So many days go by
And I still want you so
If it was up to me
I`d never let you go
You`re the only true love in my life
And I want you to know
All this passion and pain
I think I`m going insane
We`ve got nothing to lose
And so much to gain
If you love me today
Who`s to say you`d not leave me again
Do you remember the night
I can see it so clear
All the sweet little things
That you sang in my ear
There were promises made
But I think you forgot
What you said
There`s a real fine line
Between love and hate

Can't help but wonder

845,1988,D.J. Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince,Parents Just Don't Understand,"[Intro]
You know parents are the same no matter time nor place
They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
So to you other kids all across the land
There's no need to argue, parents just don't understand

[Verse 1]
I remember one year
My mom took me school shopping
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
My mom started bugging with the clothes she chose
I didn't say nothing at first
I just turned up my nose
She said, “What's wrong? This shirt cost $20”
I said, “Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!”
The next half hour was the same old thing
My mother buying me clothes from 1963
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, “Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep”
She said, “You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet”
I said, “Mom, let's put these clothes back, please”
She said “No, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show”
I said, “This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
But if you don't want to I can live with that but
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks”
She wasn't moved - everything stayed the same
Inevitably the first day of school came
I thought I could get over, I tried to play sick
But my mom said, “No, no way, uh-uh, forget it”
There was nothing I could do, I tried to relax
I got dressed up in those ancient artifacts
And when I walked into school, it was just as I thought
The kids were cracking up laughing at the clothes Mom bought
And those who weren't laughing still had a ball
Because they were pointing and whispering
As I walked down the hall
I got home and told my Mom how my day went
She said, “If they were laughing you don't need them
'Cause they're not good friends”
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
So to you all the kids all across the land
There's no need to argue
Parents just don't understand
[Verse 2]
Oh-kay, here's the situation
My parents went away on a week's vacation and
They left the keys to the brand new Porsche
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I'll just take it for a little spin
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood
Well, maybe I shouldn't...
Yeah, of course, I should
Pay attention, here's the thick of the plot
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
I honked my horn just to get her attention
She said, “Was that for me?”
I said, “Yeah”
She said, “Why?”
I said, “Come on and take a ride with a helluva guy”
She said, “How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic”
I said, “C'mon, toots, my name is the Prince
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?”
She agreed and we were on our way
She was looking very good and so was I, I must say - word
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
We ordered two Big Macs and two large fries with Cokes
She kicked her shoes off onto the floor
She said, “Drive fast, speed turns me on”
She put her hand on my knee, I put my foot on the gas
We almost got whiplash, I took off so fast
The sunroof was open, the music was high
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
She had opened up three buttons on her shirt so far
I guess that's why I didn't notice that police car
We're doing ninety in my Mom's new Porsche
And to make this long story short - short
When the cop pulled me over I was scared as hell
I said, “I don't have a license but I drive very well, officer”
I almost had a heart attack that day
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
My parents had to come off from vacation to get me
I'd rather be in jail than to have my father hit me
My parents walked in
I got my grip, I said, “Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?”
They didn't speak - I said, “I want to plead my case”
But my father just shoved me in the car by my face
That was a hard ride home, I don't know how I survived
They took turns - one would beat me while the other was driving
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
Well parents are the same no matter time nor place
So to you other kids all across the land
Take it from me, parents just don't understand"

847,1988,Billy Ocean,The Colour Of Love,"Ooh, ooh, ooh
If I had to paint a picture
To show the world how love can really be
I would use the brightest colours
To create a vision of harmony

It would be a reality
Cause it's only what's inside of my heart
You would see I've always loved you
Right from the very start

Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm, is it tender
When you think of me
I'll see the colour of love
When I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting
Of love forever true

The colours of the rainbow turn grey
Whenever you're so far away
It changes like the seasons
You're the reason it happens that way

What you see are colours of emotion
Reflecting what I feel deep inside
Now I'd like to take a look
At emotions that you hide
Tell me what is the colour of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm, is it tender
When you think of me
I'll see the colour of love
When I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting
Of love forever true

And, oh, though many may try
To keep us apart
Oh, the colours that I see in you
Will shine a light to see us through
No matter what the world will do
I'll always love you

Oh, what is the colour of love?
What do you see?
Is it warm, is it tender
When you think of me
I'll see the colour of love
When I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting
Of love forever true

What is the colour of love
Oh, tell me, tell me
Oh, I wanna know, I wanna know
(I see the colour of love)
When I'm thinking of you
As a picture perfect painting
Of love forever true"
848,1988,Terence Trent D'Arby,Sign Your Name,"[Verse 1]
Fortunately you have got
Someone who relies on you
We started out as friends
But the thought of you just caves me in

The symptoms are so deep
It is so much too late
To turn away
We started out as friends

[Chorus]
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

[Verse 2]
Time, I'm sure will bring
Disappointments in so many things
It seems to be the way
When your gambling cards on love you play

I'd rather be in hell
With you baby
Than in cool Heaven
It seems to be the way
[Chorus]
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

[Bridge]
Birds never look into the sun
Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue, leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

[Verse 3]
All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love and the Earth rotates
To our dictates, slowly we make love

[Chorus]
Sign your name across my heart (Sign your name)
I want you to be my baby (Be my baby)
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady
(Sign your name, sign your name)
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby..."

In my imagination
There is no complication
I dream about you all the time
In my mind, a celebration
The sweetest of sensation
Thinking you could be mine

[Pre-Chorus]
In my imagination
There is no hesitation
We walk together hand in hand
I'm dreaming
You fell in love with me
Like I'm in love with you

I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love
I should be so lucky
Lucky, lucky, lucky
I should be so lucky in love

You always keep me waiting
Because it's only make believe
And I would come a-running
To give you all my loving
If one day, you would notice me

My heart is close to breaking
And I can't go on faking
The fantasy that you'll be mine
I'm dreaming

853,1988,Natalie Cole,Pink Cadillac,"You may think I'm fooling
For the foolish things I do
You may wonder how come I love you
When you get on my nerves like you do

Well baby you know you bug me
There ain't no secret about that
Well, come on over here and hug me
Baby I'll spill the facts

Well, honey it ain't your money
'Cause I got plenty of that

I love you for your pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do
There in the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Well, now way back in the Bible
Temptations always come along
There's always somebody tempting you
Into doing something they know is wrong
Well, they tempt you, ma'am, with silver
And they tempt you, sir, with gold
And they tempt you with the pleasures
That flesh does surely hold

They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple
Man, I ain't going for that

I know it was her pink Cadillac
Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you're doing
In the back of your pink Cadillac
Pink Cadillac

Now, now, now, some folks say it's too big
And uses too much gas
Some folks say that it's too old
And that it just goes too fast

Oh, but love is bigger than a Honda (Honda)
And it's bigger than a Subaru (that too)
Hey man there's only one thing
And one car that will do
Anyway we don't have to drive it
Honey, we can park it out in back
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Crushed velvet seats
Riding in the back, oozing down the street
Waving to the girls, peeling out of sight
Spending all my money on a Saturday night
Honey, I just wonder what you do there
In the back of your pink Cadillac
You know the one I mean, Le Car
Woah! Cadillac"

855,1988,Climie Fisher,Love Changes (Everything),"I was only seventeen when she looked at me that way
Seems like yesterday
I was only fooling round but she stole my heart away
I've never been the same

I felt the strangest feeling
Like a raging fire it burned
She left, I cried for weeks
And I can't forget her or the lesson that I learned

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings, oho

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

Then the years went rolling by, I grew up and moved away
Had to earn my pay
Found another lover then but my heart is sad to say
It only ended up the same way

And I wondered: was I destined to spend my life alone?
Oh, girl, you answered my question
This time it's working, you've given me new hope
Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Love changes everything

I've seen the way love shakes you, makes you, breaks you
It's got a power of its own

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes the rules from fools to kings
Love changes
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything

(Love makes you fly) Flying away, oho
(Love changes) Let's make love
(Love changes everything) Oh

Love changes, changes everything
Love makes you fly, it can break your wings
Don't forget it, girl (Love changes)
Don't you forget it, baby
Love changes everything"

Don't know how to feel
Your eyes tell me
You want me back
But I can't believe it's real

Forgive me for dreaming
But I thought I saw you look at me
With your loving eyes
Like when you did way back when

Forgive me for dreaming

So long to wait

To watch it grow and make it last

Burn a little stronger?

Who are at the end of their rope

Sometimes life can be so grand

We were gettin' ready
To shake out of that place

Got in my face
He said, You're on private property
But once he cooled down he was ok
Sometimes you're golden, man

But there's something on my mind

But all we found was an empty place

I learned
Is that I need you desperately

And can you please tell me

Won't they always love you?

And I know that you still care, for me
Ooh baby

That dreams don't turn to gold
And that there is no easy way
No, you just can't run away
And what we have is so much more
Than we ever had before
And no matter how I try
You're always on my mind

That you'd never desert me
So where are you now
You built me up
Then you left me standing all alone
Lost in the crowd

I should but why do I hurt so

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all

Maybe I should learn to live life without you
Find someone new
But something happens deep inside when our eyes meet
I know you feel it too

Don't try and say you're happy without me
Don't say you don't miss my love, boy

No one wins when the love is lost
You turned your back on me
When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all
Maybe we can find a way
To bring back all the yesterdays
Maybe we can find the path
It's not too late to save the love
Save the love we had

Most of all

When I needed you most of all
No one wins when love takes a fall
How could you let me down
I needed you most of all"

The rules say anything goes but I don't want to play

You said I could walk away
Take me back to where my life burns

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run

Took a long walk down through the backstreets
I heard the city scream
Reminds me of the time I run wicked and free

And now here I stand all alone
But I'm back to where my life burns

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run
One heart, one home
But I'm still holding on
I've loved, but I've roamed
And now I'm going home, going home, yeah

I'm still searching for something
Still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run

I'm still searching for something
I'm still looking for someone
But I'm caught in the middle
Of a broken heart and a life on the run
A broken heart and a life on the run
A broken heart, life on the run"

The color of the sky as far as I can see is coal gray
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lips as if i might cry
Well by the force of will my lungs are filled and so i breathe
Lately it seems this big bed is where i never leave
Shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
Quiver in my voice as i cry

[Chorus:]
What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?

[Verse 2:]
I hear the sound of a noon bell chime, i'm far behind
You've put in 'bout half a day while here i lie
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my lip as if i might cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Do i need someone
Here to scold me or do i need someone
Who'll grab and pull me
Out of this four poster dull torpor
Pulling downward
It is such a long time since my better days
I say my prayers nightly this will pass away
The color of the sky is gray as i can see through the blinds
Lift my head from the pillow and then fall again
With a shiver in my bones just thinking about the weather
A quiver in my voice as i cry
[Chorus:]
What a cold and rainy day
Where on earth is the sun hid away?
I shiver, quiver, and try to wake"

To the bone for you
What do I get in return

And when I think
About the things you do
You know I go into a slow burn

I ain't trying to run your life
All I want is you to realize

All I'm asking
Darling, Danielle, don't
Oh, no, Danielle, don't, oh, no

I know temptation
Gets the best of you
You may invite it
I don't know

Everyone needs a little excitement
I know that's true
Just how far will you go

Think twice
You know it's a mistake
Take my advice
Before it's too late
All I'm asking
Darling, Danielle, don't
Oh, no, Danielle, don't
No, no, no, no, Danielle, don't

Girl, don't do it
Girl, don't do it
No, no, no, no

Remember the good times
The fun we had
When you were my lover
Was that so bad

Honey, you don't need a lover
You need an audience
Well, this show is over
This is how it all ends

Wow, don't, don't
Don't do it, baby
No, no, no, no

Yes, I'm begging on my knees...."

Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Got myself a roommate, and Walter was his name
He liked to play strange games
He had a certain hobby, he always liked to do
He thought it was so cool
He started making money, but couldn't pay the rent
It didn't make too much sense
So I tried to ask him nicely, when he planned to pay
He said, ""I doubt it'll be today""

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Started coming up with clothes I could not buy
And some I could not find
Taking girls to dinner, two at a time
I didn't pay no mind
When I saw him driving a brand new fancy car
I knew he'd gone too far
So when I tried again to ask him to pay today
Walter said, ""Today? No way""
Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen
Hey little Walter
Something's gonna getcha little Walter

Things were getting serious, I had to set him straight
My landlord could not wait
I sat him down and told him, he played me for a fool
'Cause I knew the things you do
Things start getting nasty, we broke into fight
I thought it would be short, but it lasted half the night
By the time we were finished, there was a knock at the door
When Walter went to open it, he was blown to the floor

Hey little Walter
Hey little Walter
Walter listen

Something's gonna getcha little Walter

A whole heap of nothing for you and me
Take me to the desert, take me to the sand
Show me the color of your right hand

[Chorus]
You have placed a chill in my heart
You have placed a chill in my heart

[Verse 2]
Love is a temple, love is a shrine
Buy some love at the five and dime
A little bit of love from the counter store
Get it on credit if you need some more
I'll be the figure of your disgrace
A criss-cross pattern upon your face
A woman's just too tired to think
About the dirty old dishes in the kitchen sink

[Verse 3]
I wish I was invisible, so I could climb through the telephone
When it hurts my ear, and it hurts my brain
And it makes me feel too much
Too much, too much, too much
Don't cut me down when I'm talking to you
'Cause I'm much too tall to feel that small
[Verse 4]
Love is a temple, love is a shrine
Love is pure, and love is blind
Love is a religious sign
I'm gonna leave this love behind
Love is hot, and love is cold
I've been bought, and I've been sold
Love is rock, and love is roll
I just want someone to hold

[Bridge]
Hold me now!
Hold me now, baby!
Come on!
Yeah!

Just like a fantasy
You're here along with me
So now it seems we've slipped into reality
And it's plain to see this is our destiny

Feelings I try to hold just seem to take control
I lie awake
My body shakes with just one thought of you
The door is open wide
So won't you come inside
And do those special things that lovers do

Take it while it's hot

Sometimes I'm shy
But now I think that you should know
The deeper that we go
The more my feelings show
Time passes by just like birthdays come and go
So light the candles, babe
And I'll make a wish and blow

I love the way you groove
I'm gonna make this move
It's time to live
I wanna give you what your waiting for
The lights are pink and low
I think we're good to go
We're wasting time and I can't wait no more

About another sordid hall of dreams
About a man who's king of industry
He would swear by his mouth almighty
He would buy the best
But never something new
And he never told me

Wishing I was lucky
Wishing I was lucky, wishing I was lucky
Oh I like kicking in the gutter

Somewhere, somewhere
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

The mist is lifting slowly
I can see the way ahead
And I've left behind the empty streets
That once inspired my life
And the strength of the emotion
Is like thunder in the air
'Cause the promise that we made each other
Haunts me to the end

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

The secret of your beauty
And the mystery of your soul
I've been searching for in everyone I meet
And the times I've been mistaken
It's impossible to say
And the grass is growing
Underneath our feet
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you

You see, I know you're out there somewhere
Oh yes, I know you're out there somewhere

You see, I know I'll find you somehow
Oh yes, I know I'll find you somehow

The words that I remember
From my childhood still are true
That there's none so blind
As those who will not see
And to those who lack the courage
And say it's dangerous to try
Well they just don't know
That love eternal will not be denied

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you
Yes I know it's going to happen

I can feel you getting near

And soon we'll be returning
To the fountain of our youth
And if you wake up wondering
(If you wake up wondering)
In the darkness I'll be there
(You know I'll be there)
My arms will close around you
And protect you with the truth

I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere, somewhere
I know you're out there somewhere
Somewhere you can hear my voice
I know I'll find you somehow
Somehow, somehow
I know I'll find you somehow
And somehow I'll return again to you"
878,1988,Corey Hart,In Your Soul,"Ever since I was a little kid
I have always thought
I could run faster than the wind
Stare up to the sky with open spaces
I could live and die
Man you can't find that in no book
Never find that in no book
Someone will drag you down
And try to knock you under
Hey mama said with her words of wonder
Don't matter cause
Cause it's in your soul

I have always felt
That I had to prove it to myself
No salvation from the firin' line
A million dreams won't set you free
God I know there's something trapped in me
There's no refuge from the ride
No shelter ever saved a man his pride
Give you pain and never feed your hunger
I won't close my eyes
When it rains and thunders
Don't matter cause
Cause it's in your soul
And when the night is overcome
And I've been racin' down a road
That's got no trace, no face
If I could live by the words I've sung
And carry all the choices I've made
I swear, I swear I'll be there

Hey mister don't shadow box with me
Cause I don't wanna someday be
An old man cursin' what I might have been
Now I realize what I see
That the wind was never chasin' me
And I don't feel so alone
I can close my eyes I'm goin' home

Behind the clouds the sun is shinin'
Some rain will fall no use cryin'
O no, o no not me
Got a picture in my head
That won't let go of
Young man running in search of
Count your blessings
Cause it's in your soul
O it's in your soul
In your soul, o no
Ever since I was a little kid
I have always thought
Young man running..."

Baby, baby
When I called you on the phone today
You sounded frantic when you said
Come over right away
Oh, baby, baby
Won't you say what's on your mind?

Your TV set is acting up
And you don't understand
You're so upset
Because you can't watch All My Children
And you wonder
If there's something I can do for you

Well
All that I can say

Baby
I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby
I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do

Don't call me when your car
Just can't get into second gear
Or when your kitchen sink
Is shooting water in your ear

Oh, baby, baby
I have told you this before
Is there a special reason
That you just can't understand

I'm not the one to call
When you need a heavy man
Unless whatever needs fixing, girl
Is you

And I just have to say

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
Don't call me
When your toaster won't pop up
Don't call me
Just to cut your lawn
Don't call me
When your radio cuts off
In the middle of your favorite song
Don't call me when your shower just went
Uh-uh, no, baby
Don't call me
I think I told you this
About a million times
You know, it's not my cup of tea

[Chorus:]
I can rocket 2 u
The only thing I can do
I can rocket all night

I can rocket 2 u, baby
Let me rocket 2 ya, oh yeah
Just a little bit more

Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
Baby, I can rocket 2 u

Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do
Baby, I can rocket 2 u
Honey, the only thing I can do
Baby, I can rocket all night
One thing I know I can do"
880,1988,Julio Iglesias Featuring Stevie Wonder,My Love,"My love is warmer than a smile
My love gives to every needing child
If anyone should ask you who's my true love
Tell them my love true is ever letting all their love come through

My love sees love with not a face
And lives to love through time and space
If all of everything about my love fits to the tune of you
Then you can say that you are my love too

Let my love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over

Our love sees love's the key to peace
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased
Should you or anyone you know enough to say they feel as we
Then let our universal song be free

Let our love shine throughout the world
To every mountain top and steeple
Let it be felt by every soul
'Til love's all over
Let it reach out to every heart
To every disenfranchised people
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over
Say words of love to all we see
To rich or poor for love is equal
Let us lift up humanity
Spead love all over
Let all its forces join as one
So to rebuke all signs of evil
Through every valley, land and sea
Our love's all people"

You say how much you want me
But I've heard it all before

If you want to be with me tonite
Show your stuff , Cause words are not enough
I want to hear your body talk to mine)

A message revealed in your eyes
You know I can't wait
To know your passion
It's not to late
So take some action
Can you say that when you're through
I'll know what love is all about
Well, baby I've been patient, now
I'm ready to find out

And it nearly drove me out of my mind
Always thinking what she meant to me
All we left behind
Can't be afraid, startin' over
Gotta get up, start livin' again
When you're drownin' in your loneliness
The hurtin' never ends....
And the night rolls on
I search for some piece of mind
No, I can't be wrong
Won't get burned by desire this time

Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

Wanna get close with somebody
When a voice says I'm movin' too fast
It's hard to know when to walk away
Or try to make it last......
Still the night rolls on
Secrets are safe in the dark
And I stayed too long
I'm not gonna lie to my heart
Gonna wait on love, holdin' on till I find the one
Wait on love, won't hold back
I promised myself, till it comes...
Gonna wait on love

Someone I can run to
Just know that it's right
Trust my heart and soul to
For the rest of my life...."

885,1988,Ice-T,Colors,"[Intro]
Yo Iz, let's do this

[Verse 1: Ice-T]
I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath talkin'
King of my jungle, just a gangster stalkin'
Livin' life like a firecracker, quick is my fuse
Vendettas of death back; the colors I choose
Red or Blue, Cuz or Blood, it just don't matter
Sucka dive for your life when my shotgun scatters
The gangs of L.A. will never die - just multiply

[Interlude: Ice-T]
You see they hit us then we hit them
Then we hit them and they hit us, man
It's like a war, ya know what I'm sayin'
People don't even understand
They don't even know what they dealing with
You wanna get rid of the gangs it's gonna take a lotta work
But people don't understand the size of this
This is no joke man, this is real

[Verse 2: Ice-T]
You don't know me, fool
You disown me, cool
I don't need your assistance, social persistence
Any problem I got I just put my fist in
My life is violent but violent is life
Peace is a dream, reality is a knife
My colors, my honor, my colors, my all
With my colors upon me one soldier stands tall
Tell me what have you left me, what have I got?
Last night in cold blood my young brother got shot
My homeboy got jacked
My mother's on crack
My sister can't work cause her arms show tracks
Madness insanity, live in profanity
Then some punk claimin' they're understandin' me
Give me a break, what world do you live in
Death is my set, guess my religion
[Interlude: Ice-T]
Yo my brother was a gang banger
And all my homeboys bang
I don't know why I do it man, I just do it
I never had much of nothing man
Look at you man, you've got everything going for yourself
And I ain't got nothing man, I've got nothing
I'm living in the ghetto man
Just look at me man, look at me

[Verse 3: Ice-T]
My pants are saggin', braided hair
Suckas stare but I don't care
My game ain't knowledge, my game's fear
I've no remorse so squares beware
But my true mission is just revenge
You ain't in my set, you ain't my friend
Wear the wrong color your life could end
Homicide's my favorite binge

[Interlude: Ice-T]
Listen to me man
No matter whatcha do don't ever join a gang
You don't wanna be in it man
You're just gonna end up in a mix of dead friends and time in jail
I know, if I had a chance like you
I would never be in a gang man
But I didn't have a chance
You know I wish I did
[Verse 4: Ice-T]
I'll just walk like a giant, police defiant
You'll say to stop but I'll say that I can't
My gang's my family, it's all that I have
I'm a star, on the walls is my autograph
You don't like it, so you know where you can go
Cause the streets are my stage and terror's my show
Psycho-analyze tried diagnosin' me, why?
It wasn't your brother that brutally died
But it was mine, so let me define
My territory; don't cross the line
Don't try to act crazy cause that shit don't faze me
If you ran like a punk, it wouldn't amaze me
Cause my colors death
Though we all want peace
But our war won't end
'Till all wars cease

[Interlude: Ice-T]
See the wars of the street gangs will always get to me, man
But I don't wanna be down with this situation man
But I'm in here, if I had something better to do I think I'd do it But right now, I'm just down here boy
I'm trying to get money cause I'm smart
I'm gonna get paid while I'm out here
I'm gonna get that paper, ya know what I'm saying
If I had a chance like you
Maybe I would be in school
But I'm not, I'm out here living day to day surviving
And I'm willing to die for my colors

Yo, please stop cause I want y'all to live
This is Ice-T, peace"

And there is something in your eyes that's longing for some more

You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
I got a plan to get us outta here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be living

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He lives with a bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
When momma went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school, and that's what I did
[Refrain]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight, or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arms felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged
I-I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinkin' late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me'd find it
I got no plans, I ain't going nowhere
So take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast it felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I-I had a feeling that I belonged

But you'll never get away from you

Sayin' sorry don't make it right every time you hurt me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye, every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right, no, no

I know that mistakes are so hard to deal with
But when you reject me, I always feel it
And when you choose to ignore what you don't understand
You will find often time how things get out of hand

You can run away from me
But you'll never get away from you
You can run away from me
But you'll never, never get away

Sayin' sorry don't make it right every time you hurt me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye, every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
Every time that you break my heart
You come back to me and try to make a new start
But this hurt only gives me doubt
And it seems you don't wanna work things out

Take your sorry (uh) out the door
I don't wanna hear that (uh-uh) anymore
Take your sorry, and, baby, this is the plan
You can take that sorry, baby, and stick it
Ooh

Sayin' sorry don't...
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
When we don't meet eye to eye, every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right

Sayin' sorry don't make it right
Sayin' sorry, oh

When we don't meet eye to eye, every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
It won't make things right
Won't make things right

When we don't meet eye to eye
Every time it hurts me
Sayin' sorry don't make it right
I don't wanna hear you say
I don't wanna hear you say you're sorry
For what you did to me
Ooh, baby
Baby, get, baby, get, baby, get hold of this

I can take only just so much
And I have taken what I intend to take"
896,1988,The Smithereens,Only A Memory,"My mind is filled with thoughts of you
I think about the days of two
I search the room but you're not there
Your perfume lingers everywhere
But it's

Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

In a world of pain I have no peer
You fade away and disappear
And now I have to learn the game
Where no one wins or takes the blame
But it's

Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Now that we are history
Only a memory
Only a memory
But it's
Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory

Why should it matter if I cry
I sit around and wonder why
Now I feel much too weak to live
And I've got nothing left to give
Now it's

Only a memory
Of what our love was going to be
Only a memory
Broken bits of you and me
Only a memory
Only a memory
Only a memory

Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah

Of her life is about to be found, hoo!

True love forever after

All at once I looked and you were gone
And now you're looking back at me
Searching for a way that we can be like we were before

Now I'm back to what I knew before you
Somehow the city doesn't look the same
I'd give my life for one more night
Of having you here to hold me tight; oh, please
Take me there again
Oh, oh

And I remember how you loved me
Time was all we had until the day we said goodbye
I remember every moment of those endless summer nights

I still recall the walks along the beaches
And the way your hair would glisten in the sun
Rising in the afternoon
Making love to you under the moon, oh

Do you remember all the nights we spent in silence
Every single breath you took was mine
We can have it all again
Say that you'll be with me when the sun brings your heart to mine
Oh, oh

So please don't run away from what we have together

Everybody out there don't talk less about me
Cause I'm rocking it steady
And when I'm on the mic, don't you dare call me Freddy
Cause I'm ready to really get paid
And if anybody steps in my way they getting slayed
My name is Brown, that's what they call me
Yes, I drive a 560 SEC
And when I'm on the mic, you gotta see me
Driving down the block cause I'm blocking and locking
When the sucker M.C.'s trying to drop my spot
When I'm rocking on the microphone

Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?

Has gone away, I don't know why
She's gone away, I don't know where
Somewhere I cannot follow her

The one good thing didn't stay too long
My back was turned and she was gone

[Chorus]
Good thing
Where have you gone?
My good thing
You've been gone too long

[Verse 2]
People say I should forget
There's plenty more, don't get upset
People say she's doing fine
Mutual friends I see sometime

That's not what I want to hear
I want to hear she wants me near

[Chorus]
Good thing
Where have you gone?
My good thing
You've been gone too long
Good thing

[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Then one day, she came back
I was so happy that I didn't ask
Morning came into my room
Caught me dreaming like a fool

[Outro]
Good thing, my good thing
My good thing, where have you gone
My good thing, my good thing
Where have you gone
It's been so long

Good God, girl
Good God, girl
Good God, girl
Good God"

I've got mine, woman, you've got yours too

923,1989,Elvis Costello,Veronica,"[Verse 1]
Is it all in that pretty little head of yours?
What goes on in that place in the dark?
Well, I used to know a girl and I could have sworn
That her name was Veronica

Well, she used to have a carefree mind of her own
And a delicate look in her eye
These days I'm afraid she's not even sure
If her name is Veronica

[Chorus]
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

[Verse 2]
Did the days drag by? Did the favors wane?
Did he roam down the town all the while?
Will you wake from your dream, with a wolf at the door
Reaching out for Veronica?

Well, it was all of sixty-five years ago
When the world was the street where she lived
And a young man sailed on a ship in the sea
With a picture of Veronica
[Bridge]
On the 'Empress of India'
And as she closed her eyes upon the world
And picked upon the bones of last weeks news
She spoke his name out loud again

[Chorus]
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

[Verse 3]
Veronica sits in her favorite chair
She sits very quiet and still
And they call her a name that they never get right
And if they don't then nobody else will

But she used to have a carefree mind of her own
With devilish look in her eye
Saying, ""You can call me anything you like
But my name is Veronica""

[Chorus]
Do you suppose that waiting hands on eyes
Veronica has gone to hide?
And all the time she laughs at those
Who shout her name and steal her clothes
Veronica, Veronica

It never should have been this way

Takes the fall

It replaces all
All the pain

Like toy soldiers

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

It replaces all
All the pain

Torn apart

Bit by bit
Torn apart
We never win
But the battle wages on

The rain starts to fall
And the wind blows
Through an empty hall
In the mirror
Ooh, reflections of you

In the distance I hear a sound
Is that you coming around

(I think I should) I think I should be with you

Thought I saw you
In a stranger's face
Should I call you
Or should I walk away
Around the corner
Is around the world

Is that you looking at me
Or am I living a dream, woe-oh

(A love that's overdue) Oh, a love that's overdue
Oh, I think I should be with you
And when I'm lost in a dream
You are all I can see
All alone in the night I'm waiting for you
In a moment I'd die
Just to look in your eyes
The dream is alive, I'm waiting

Oh, my (Oh, my)
How I try
To make you see that
I should be with you

I walk the streets at night
Until the morning light comes shining through
Can't get a good night's sleep
Ain't been to work in weeks
What am I gonna do?
Help me
Can't get her off my mind
I'm drinking too much wine
I'm burning up inside
If I could touch her face
Or take her out some place I'd be satisfied

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a loaded gun
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her
Hey, I'm a lovesick son
I'm crazy about her
I see her jogging in Central Park
With one of them Walkman's on her head
She was hot, young, beautiful
And I said to myself
She's destined to be mine

[Verse 2]
I see her every day
In rush hour or subway, in a grocery store
She don't notice me
I might as well just be a cockroach on the floor
If she belonged to me I'd give her everything
I'd never cheat or lie
I'd treat her with respect, not just a sex object
I ain't that kind of guy
[Chorus]
Hey, I'm a loaded gun
I'm crazy about her, crazy about her
Hey, I'm a lovesick son
I'm crazy about her

[Verse 3]
I was standing outside the Met one day
When she drove by in a black Corvette
I said, ""Hey baby""
I could've died, she looked straight through me
But I know she's destined to be mine

[Interlude]
Every night I stand around her door and wait for her to come by
She lives in one of those brown-stones with the guard outside
And the limousines and the Rolls Royces coming and going
My friends all say she's way outta my class
But I know if she'd just get know me
I could give her something all those rich guy ain't got
Yeah!

[Outro]
Ain't gonna bide my time ain't gonna stand in line
Somebody gonna get burned
But, oh the problem is I think my loves at risk
She's the boss's girl

937,1989,Thirty Eight Special,Second Chance,"[Verse 1: Carl Sherron]
I heard you robbed a couple niggas down on forty-deuce
You and your crew
You only fifteen, what the fuck you know about twenty-two's?
Slow down before you get your melon split or knocked by jake's
Cause nowadays, niggas act tough but be on some telling shit
I learned the hard way, ninth grade I use to play the raw way
Till I was tested, pulled out a weapon and caught that court case
Mom stressing, taking off work, rushing to court dates
While pops angry, telling me Lico, go get your shit straight
Believe me fam', I know G's
I was deep as a Spartan with my co-deez
If you about that, do it fadoli
Use your minds eye, think for a second before you flex your desert
Respect is something that's earned, I hope you take head to this message
It's ill in the boogie down
Some niggas came through looking for you hoodie down
Mobbing six deep, gripping a four pound
You think you thugged out, but the way I see it you bugged out
Could barely stand up straight, angel dust got you strung out
Wow, you got the juice now

[Verse 2: Wati Heru]
Underneath the shadows of the two train, we hop turnstiles
The barrel spin like turn tables when the parties turned out
In return we turn the wrist a turning point eternally
The burner twist determine if he returns from eternity
Don't be concerned with this, we firm with this like Escobar and Fox
Never spent a term on D block but yet a nigga picking locks
We shoulda known better like case after we saw the cops
Still no strangers stand by my spot
They exit or they're getting ox'd
By any God given chance I turn myself in
My attorney's in a fraternity, he'll turn that twenty-five into ten
I'll do that bid, get big, turn twenty-five into ten
Same cycle, stretch turn twenty-five outta' ten
So while they turning in they grave, I'm still collecting this yen
Same corner, thirty-eight special in the side of the Timb's
And if the jake turn the curb, I'm putting five into them
So now the table turn, El Ragga still survives in the end
Cause if I turn over the juice, another saga begins
[Outro: Wati Heru]
Said I was whylin' out, I got the juice now
Look who's whylin' now, you got the juice now

[Outro 2: Bishop]
What's the matter Raheem? Nothing to say?
That's cause you know I'm right
In your heart you know I'm right

[Q]
Yo big man, if you want respect you gotta earn it

[Bishop]
You damn right
You gotta be ready to go down, stand up, and die for that shit like Blizzard did
If you want some juice

[Q]
Blizzard? Blizzard ain't sticking up to nothing now

That's cause we wasn't there to back him up
If we was there-

Open fire!
On my burning heart
I've never been lucky in love
My defenses are down
A kiss or a frown
I can't survive on my own

If a girl walks in and draws her name in my heart
I'll turn and run away
Everyday we've all been led astray
It's hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It's making you cry
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
You're looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel

In a room behind your smile

Compose a ""baby, will you please come home?"" note

We conceived a modern generation
It was free but now we pay the price

We're the victims of our own creation
Chasing rainbows that are painted black or white
Watch the struggle of our own temptation
Instincts barely keeping us alive

Back to the rhythm that we all came from
Voices of Babylon, streets of London
Back to the people that we know so well
A space in time removed too soon to tell

Just a product of imagination
Patiently we wait for our turn to come
A small collection of the population
By the time our number's up, we could be gone

This waiting 'round's killing me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

Because I feel it all fading and paling, and I'm begging
To drag you down with me to kick the last nail in

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I like you in that like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth, then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair, just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat like we know that it's over
If you slip going under, slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face, just pull on your feet

I love 'em and I leave 'em alone
I didn't care how much they cried, on sir
They'er tiers left me cold as a stone
*I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
I've fooled around and fell in love
Used to feel that that I'd see the girl that I like
I fill in my book and I write down her name
The grass got a little greener on the other side
I just tear off a page, hey...

Free on my own
That's the way I used to be

955,1989,Tone-Loc,Funky Cold Medina,"[Intro]
Alright, dig it

[Verse 1]
Cold coolin at a bar, and I'm lookin for some action
But like Mick Jagger said, I can't get no satisfaction
The girls are all around, but none of them wanna get with me
My threads are fresh and I'm lookin def, yo, what's up with L-o-c?
The girls is all jockin at the other end of the bar
Havin drinks with some no-name chump, when they know that I'm the star
So I got up and strolled over to the other side of the cantina
I asked the guy, ""Why you so fly?"" he said, ""Funky Cold Medina""

Funky Cold Medina

[Verse 2]
This brother told me a secret on how to get more chicks
Put a little Medina in your glass, and the girls'll come real quick
It's better than any alcohol or aphrodisiac
A couple of sips of this love potion, and she'll be on your lap
So I gave some to my dog when he began to beg
Then he licked his bowl and he looked at me and did the wild thing on my leg
He used to scratch and bite me, before he was much much meaner
But now all the poodles run to my house for the Funky Cold Medina

You know what I'm sayin?
I got every dog in my neighborhood breakin down my door
I got Spuds McKenzie
Alex from Stroh's
They won't leave my dog alone with that Medina, pal
[Verse 3]
I went up to this girl, she said, ""Hi, my name is Sheena""
I thought she'd be good to go with a little Funky Cold Medina
She said, ""I'd like a drink,"" I said, ""Ehm - ok, I'll go get it""
Then a couple sips she cold licked her lips, and I knew that she was with it
So I took her to my crib, and everything went well as planned
But when she got undressed, it was a big old mess, Sheena was a man
So I threw him out, I don't fool around with no Oscar Meyer wiener
You must be sure that the girl is pure for the Funky Cold Medina

You know, ain't no plans with a man
This is the 80's, and I'm down with the ladies, ya know?

Break it down

[Verse 4]
Back in the saddle, lookin for a little affection
I took a shot as a contestant on ""The Love Connection""
The audience voted, and you know they picked a winner
I took my date to the Hilton for Medina and some dinner
She had a few drinks, I'm thinkin soon what I'll be gettin
Instead she started talkin 'bout plans for our wedding
I said, ""Wait, slow down, love, not so fast says, I'll be seein' ya""
That's why I found you don't play around with the Funky Cold Medina

Ya know what I'm sayin
That Medina's a monster, y'all

We were young, maybe twenty
You wore a white dressing gown
Drinking wine and dancing slowly
On the night I laid you down

And the moonlight revealed your body
As the radio played some old Phil Collins songs
And we believed in something holy
On the night I laid you down

[Courtney]
We had love in our eyes
We passion in our souls
There was fire in our kisses
But it was not a Phil Collins song

It might have been like Mike + The Mechanics (I don't know who that is)
Yes, you do, he was the other guy in Genesis

Stephen: No, he was the bassist. Until he was replaced...
Courtney: But his music is so much different than Phil Collins
Stephen: You didn't let me finish. By... ummmm
Courtney: [laughing]
Stephen: Okay I don't know that much about Genesis. But I know Invisible Touch had a cool hand on the cover
Courtney: Unbelievable. You are so not hip
Stephen: And I know that Phil Collins had an album called ""No Jacket Necessary.""
Courtney: No Jacket Re- Required. Thank you
Stephen: It was called No Jacket Re-re-re-re-required? I've never even heard of that

I'm in love with you girl cause you're on my mind
You're the one I think about most every time
And when you crack a smile in everything you do
Don't you understand, girl, this love is true
You’re soft, silky hand long, sweet and thin
That candlelight complexion upon your skin
It lightens up my day, and that's oh so true
Together we're one separated we're two
To make you all mine, all mine is my desire
Cause you contain a quality that I admire
You're pretty plain and simple, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true

This is some sort of thing, girl, I can't explain
My emotions starts up when I hear your name
Maybe your sweet sweet voice would ring in my ear
Then delay my system when you are near
Come with your positive emotion, love, making enjoyin
That's for me to bust it's like a girl and a boy
These feelings I get I often wonder why
So I thought I might discuss this, girl, just you and I
Now what you're wearing I don't care, as I've said before
No reason that I like you, girl, just for what you are
If I said I'd think about it, you rule my world so try to understand
I'm in love girl
I'm in so love girl
I'm just in love girl, and this is true"

Mirror mirror on the wall
Tell me mirror, what is wrong?
Can it be my De La Clothes
Or is it just my De La Soul?
What I do ain't make-believe
People say I sit and try
But when it comes to being De La
It's just me myself and I

[Hook]
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

[Verse 2 - Posdnuos]
Now you tease my Plug One style
And my Plug One spectacles
You say Plug One and Two are hippies
No we're not, thats pure plug bull
Always pushing that we formed an image
There's no need to lie
When it comes to being Plug One
It's just me myself and I

[Hook]
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
[Verse 3 - Dove]
Proud, I'm proud of what I am
Poems I speak are Plug Two type
Please oh please let Plug Two be
Himself, not what you read or write
Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie
And from me myself and I

[Hook]
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I

[Verse 4 - Posdnuos]
Glory Glory Hallelu
Glory for Plug One and Two
But that glory's been denied
By concensing dookie eyes
People think they diss my person
By stating I'm darkly packed
I know this so I point at Q-Tip
And he states, ""Black is Black""
Mirror mirror on the wall
Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin up
So I don't get an aftermath
But if I do I'll calmly punch them
In the 4th day of July
Cause they tried to mess with third degree
That's me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I
It's just me myself and I"

Oh yeah

You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
They're saying the devil's got a new job
Start praying to a new--

A lot of Babel came down the cable
Everybody can be famous for a day
From shore to shore
A big department store
Is all that's left of the American way
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah

Start praying what are you afraid of
Start praying to a new--

There's a big world
In the street outside
In their uniform of pride
And they've all come
To see a star from the east
Is he man or beast?
Decide

Feel like I'm crucified, still I'm not satisfied
The second coming is coming anyway

I hear them pray for more on every dance floor
I hear the word go out across the milky way
It's another second coming, like it or not, yeah
Oh yeah
It's another second coming, like it or not
You better start praying to a new God

Start praying, praying to a new God
Start praying to a new, new God
Success and money's what he's made of
Start praying to a new--
Start praying, praying on the freeway
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the airwaves

Start praying, praying at the back door
Start praying to a new, new God
Start praying, praying on the dance floor

973,1989,Tommy Page,A Shoulder To Cry On,"Life is full of lots of up and downs
And the distance feels further
When you're headed for the ground
And there is nothing more painful
Than to let your feelings take you down

It's so hard to know the way you feel inside
When there's many thoughts and feelings that you hide
But you might feel better
If you let me walk with you
By your side

And when you need a shoulder to cry on
When you need a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
You won't be alone, cause I'll be there
I'll be your shoulder to cry on
I'll be there
I'll be a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
You won't be alone, cause I'll be there

All of the times when everything is wrong
And you're feeling like
There's no use going on
You can't give it up
I hope you work it out and carry on
Side by side
With you till the end
I'll always be the one to firmly hold your hand
No matter what is said or done
Our love will always continue on

Everyone needs a shoulder to cry on
Everyone needs a friend to rely on
When the whole world is gone
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be there

I'll be your shoulder to cry on
I'll be there
I'll be your friend you rely on
When the whole world's gone
You won't be alone

Cause I'll be there
You'll always have my shoulder to cry on
I'll be there
I'll be the one you rely on
When the whole world's gone
You won't be alone
Cause I'll be there
And when the whole world is gone
You'll always have my shoulder to cry on"

Well, I'm the new kid, I'm just comin' up
A lot of rappers think that I can't tear it up
Well, I'ma show 'em and ignore 'em
And when they think I ain't lookin', I floor 'em
I mean take 'em out, I keep groovin'
A slick bassline keep the beat movin'
They can't take it, they just fake it
They wonder how the Rob Base make it

I keep smokin', hot like fire
You had your turn, now retire
Don't talk back, I'm not a new jack
'Cause I'm fresher than you, and you're wack
I keep tryin', I'm not lyin'
Up to number one is where I'm flyin'
I won't slow down 'cause I'm the new kid
With the devastatin' sound that hits
In the house where I used to practice
No one knew the Rob exists, but now
I'm gettin' greedy, don't lead me
The wrong way 'cause is just might, might, might
Bring me down, I'll have to fight to get back up
Move away 'cause I just won't slack up

Now, I go to shows to watch other MC's rock
And if they're good, I don't knock
The way they perform 'cause I like to see a good show
After that, go play ceelo, y'know
'Cause I'm a leader, no ,I'm not a follower
And MCs like you I swallow 'em
So don't look and try to judge me
Because you think that I'm another MC, well
I'm the new kid, I just moved around
But that don't mean I can't rip up the town
Me and my boys, we make noise
I hate MC's that think that we're toys
I'm hittin' harder than any other MC
Who try to come up and go against me

Let 'em have it, Rob Base, one time
[Verse 4: Rob Base]
Not from the old school or from the new
Applaud or boo, do what you want to
Talk to me then try to put me down
We used to be cool now we don't hang around
Used to be friends but now we're foes
Ask me why, man, no one knows
Maybe jealousy between you and me
Could be the fame, could be the money
I'm goin' for mine and I don't really care
'Cause the spotlight Rob Base don't share
I'm the headliner of this show
And you're just a kid and you need to grow because

Like sunshine (What else?) and rain
Give it to 'em, Rob Base
Everybody clap your hands now

(Yeah, keep it goin' now)
Like sunshine (What else?) and rain
Listen to us sing now

To show me her computer
She asked me if I liked it
I told her she was cuter
She wasn't that great
But it was getting kind of late

She talked about her father
Said he never really liked her
She said that she'd been married
To a schizophrenic biker
I thought I'd say goodbye
But then I saw her start to cry

We danced by the light of her video screen
She looked me in the eyes and said ""Why me?""

On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall
With all of the people yelling and clapping
Anything can happen, anything at all

She drove a baby blue Ferrari
She was all silk and diamonds
Living at the top, no need for social climbing
I asked her for a ride
She said ""Right here by my side""
We went to her place overlooking the bay
She said ""There's just one bed
Would that be okay?""
On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall
With all of the people yelling and clapping
Anything can happen, anything at all

Successful romance comes when you leave it up to chance
There's nothing you can do
When the fire burns low and your heart turns cold
It comes to you out of the blue

On any given night anything can happen
When the underdog is hungry the favorite might fall

You can take you place...

Waiting for you in vain
I can't hear your voice
Although I call your name
I can't go on but I still hang on just the same

I've spent endless nights
Crying you name out loud
But still remain
Alone in an empty crowd
As time goes on I realize you'll never change

I say a prayer
I count the hours
I hear a voice but it's not yours
I count the score
I can't go on playing the waiting game

If you should ever change your mind
I'll be there just call my name
Until then I'll be playing the waiting game

I've waited too long
Wishing my life away
Convincing myself
Tomorrow you'd change your ways
I can't go on but I still hang on just the same
I say a prayer
I count the hours
I hear a voice but it's not yours
I count the score
I can't go on playing the waiting game

All you left me with emptiness
Now everyday seems the same
You've gone but I'm still playing the waiting game

If you should ever change your mind
I'll be there just call my name
Until then I'll be playing the waiting game

I've waited too long for you to change your ways
Playing the waiting game

All you left me with emptiness
Now everyday seems the same
You've gone but I'm still playing the waiting game
