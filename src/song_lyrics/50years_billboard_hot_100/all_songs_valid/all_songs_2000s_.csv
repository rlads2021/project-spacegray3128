Ladies and gents, turn up your sound systems to the sound of Carlos Santana and the G&B, it's The Product of get-away blues from the refugee camp

[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh, Maria, Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star
Oh, Maria, Maria
She fell in love in East L.A
To the sounds of the guitar, yeah, yeah
Played by Carlos Santana

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 1: David McRae]
Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poor is getting poorer
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox, there's an eviction letter
Signed by the judge, said see you later
[Pre-Chorus: Santana & Wyclef Jean]
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (East Coast)
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (West Coast)
[Chorus: David McRae]
Oh, Maria, Maria

[Guitar Solo: Carlos Santana]

[Verse 2: David McRae]
I said a la favella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Ni gota de esperanza
Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise

[Bridge: Santana & Wyclef Jean]
Ahora vengo mama chula, mama chula

Maria, you know you're my lover
When the wind blows, I can feel you
Through the weather and even when we're apart
It feels like we're together

I just wanted you to comfort me
When I called you late last night you see
I was falling' into love
Oh yes, I was crashing' into love
Oh of all the words you sang to me
About life, the truth and being' free yea

All the while you were in front of me I never realized

And I promise you this time I'll see it in your eyes
I didn't see it, I can't believe it
Oh but I feel it
When you sing to me
[Verse 2]
Just to think you live inside of me
I had no idea how this could be
Now I'm crazy for your love
Can't believe I'm crazy for your love
The words you said you sang to me
And you showed me where I wanna be
Yea you sang to me, oh you sang to me

All the while you were in front of me I never realized

3,2000,Faith Hill,Breathe,"[Intro]
I can feel the magic floating in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I've
Never been this swept away

[Verse 1]
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away
The only thing I hear
Is the beating of your heart

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Verse 2]
In a way, I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumbling down
I'm closer than I've ever felt before
And I know, and you know
There's no need for words right now
[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel you breathe, it's washing over me
And suddenly, I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove
Baby, all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch, slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Caught up in the touch
The slow and steady rush
Baby, isn't that the way that love's supposed to be?
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe

Being with you gets me that way"
4,2000,Enrique Iglesias,Be With You,"[Verse 1]
Monday night and I feel so low
I count the hours, but they go so slow
I know the sound of your voice can save my soul
City lights, streets of gold
Look out my window to the world below
Moves so fast, but it feels so cold
And I'm all alone (All alone)
Don't let me die
I'm losing my mind
Baby, just give me a sign

[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep, I'm up all night
Through these tears, I try to smile
I know the touch of your hand can save my life
But don't let me down
Come to me now
I got to be with you somehow
[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you (Be with you)
Wanna be with you

[Post-Chorus]
Don't let me down
Come to me now

[Bridge]
I got to be with you somehow
And now that you're gone
Who am I without you now?
I can't go on
I just wanna be with you (Be with you)

[Chorus]
And now that you're gone
Just wanna be with you (Be with you)

Wanna be with you

Just wanna be with you
And I can't go on
I wanna be with you

[Verse 1: Aaliyah]
What would you do to get to me?
What would you say to have your way?
Would you give up, or try again
If I hesitate to let you in?
Now would you be yourself, or play a role?
Tell all the boys, or keep it low?
If I say no, would you turn away
Or play me off, or would you stay, oh?

6,2000,Eminem,The Real Slim Shady,"[Intro]
May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here...

[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said… nothing, you idiots!
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who,"" ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals—well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes—
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!
You think I give a damn about a GRAMMY?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?""
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups
All you do is annoy me, so I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate, I'm going, when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
[Chorus]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Outro]
Ha ha, I guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us
Fuck it, let's all stand up!

7,2000,Vertical Horizon,Everything You Want,"[Verse 1]
Somewhere there's speaking
It's already coming in
Oh and it's rising at the back of your mind
You never could get it
Unless you were fed it
Now you're here and you don't know why
But under skinned knees and the skid marks
Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Verse 2]
You're waiting for someone
To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away
There's always another wound to discover
There's always something more you wish he'd say
[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Bridge]
But you'll just sit tight
And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

[Verse 3]
Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return
[Chorus]
He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you
And you don't know why

[Chorus 2]
I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
I say all the right things
At exactly the right time
But I mean nothing to you and I don't know why
And I don't know why
Why
I don't know"

Oh, baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love
That I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent"
9,2000,Macy Gray,I Try,"[Verse 1]
Games, changes and fears
When will they go from here?
When will they stop?
I believe that fate has brought us here
And we should be together, babe
But we're not

[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Verse 2]
I may appear to be free
But I'm just a prisoner of your love
And I may seem alright and smile when you leave
But my smiles are just a front
Just a front, hey!
[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
And I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning

[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

[Bridge]
Here is my confession
May I be your possession?
Boy, I need your touch
Your love, kisses, and such
With all my might, I try
But this I can't deny
Deny

[Pre-Chorus]
I play it off, but I'm dreaming of you
(But I'm dreaming of you, babe)
I'll keep my cool, but I'm feigning
[Chorus]
I try to say goodbye and I choke (Yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble (Oh!)
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near
Goodbye and I choke (Yeah, yeah, yeah!)
I try to walk away and I stumble (Hey, yeah, yeah!)
Though I try to hide it, it's clear (Sick of love)
My world crumbles when you are not near (Love, your love, kisses ends)
Goodbye and I choke (Goodbye and I choke, yeah)
I try to walk away and I stumble
Though I try to hide it, it's clear
My world crumbles when you are not near

Listen, girl
Didn't he tell you the truth?
If not, then why don't you ask him?
Then maybe, you can be more into him
Instead of worryin' about me
And hopefully you won't find
All of the reasons why his love didn't count
And why we couldn't work it out

When dreaming I'm guided to another world
Time and time again
At sunrise I fight to stay asleep
Because I don't want to leave the comfort of this place
Because there's a hunger, a longing to escape
From the life I live when I'm awake

[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

[Verse 2]
Although I would like our world to change
It helps me to appreciate
Those nights and those dreams
But, my friend, I'd sacrifice all those nights
If I could make the Earth and my dreams the same
The only difference is
To let love replace all our hate
[Pre-Chorus]
So let's go there
Let's make our escape
Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

[Chorus]
Can you take me higher?
To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets

Come on, let's go there
Let's ask, ""Can we stay?""

Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine
Set up high I'm strong enough to take these dreams and make them mine

To a place where blind men see
Can you take me higher?
To a place with golden streets
Can you take me higher?

Can you take me higher?

There you go because your lies got old
Look at you, there you go

Please don't come around talking about how you changed

Say you wanna change, I won't

You always make me smile
When I'm feeling down
You give me such a vibe

Uh, uh uh uh
It's big pimpin' baby (That's right)
It's big pimpin', spendin' Gs
Feel me uh-huh uhh, uh-huh
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah
Ge-ge-geyeah, geyeah

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Nigga, it's the big Southern rap impresario
Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!
[Chorus 2: Bun B]
We be big pimpin', spendin' cheese
We be big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s

Smokin' out, pourin' up
Keepin' lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee
MTV jam of the week
Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

[Verse 1]
The cowboy kills the rock star
And Friday night's gone too far
The dim light hides the years
On all the faded girls
Forgotten but not gone
You drink it off your mind
You talk about the world like it's someplace that you've been

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

[Chorus]
Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die
[Verse 2]
You choke down all your anger
Forget your only son
You pray to statues when you sober up for fun
Your anger don't impress me
The world slapped in your face
It always rains like hell on the loser's day parade

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

Broadway's dark tonight
A little bit weaker than you used to be
Broadway's dark tonight
See the young man sitting in the old man's bar
Waiting for his turn to die

You see, you'd love to run home, but you know you ain't got one
Cause you're living in a world that you're best forgotten, around here

When you're thinking you're a joke and nobody's going to listen
To the one small point I know they've been missing around here

25,2000,Carl Thomas,I Wish,"[Verse 1]
It was love at first sight
I know from the way she looked at me
Her eyes said it all
Long days and nights, we spent
Until she dropped the bomb on me
When she said that she
Was unhappily married with children

[Chorus]
And I wish I never met her at all
Even though I love her so
She got love for me
But she still belongs to someone else

[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad, for sure
Because she wants to be with me
But she cannot be with me
She chose to stay, at home
So they could be a family
For the children
But what about me?

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Maybe in another life
Things could be the way we both desired
It's a catch-22
Either way it went
Someone had to lose

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
I wish I wish I never met her at all
I wouldn't hurt so much inside
Oh I wouldn't feel this pain
If I never met her at all, at all, at all
Wish I never, wish I never"

Man, it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My muñequita, my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason, the step in my groove

[Bridge]
And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

[Chorus]
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth
Gimme your heart, make it real, or else forget about it

[Verse 2]
I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it would be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio, you hear my rhythm on the radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

And if you say this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth

It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth

Oh, and we sat there talkin' just like we were old friends
Oh, then I ask her can I see you again

She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate
And she said yes

The days flew by like a fast train
Nothin' else has been on my brain
Except the thought of how she makes me the man I want to be
She's the one I want for a million reasons
And loving her is just like breathin'
It's easy and it's obvious she was made for me
Oh, then it happened one night lookin' in her eyes
Oh, when I popped the question much to my surprise
She said yes
And I said wow
She said when
And I said how about right now
Love can't wait
Then I asked if she believed in fate

So I called the preacher, family, and friends

But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in here, up in here

33,2000,Nine Days,Absolutely (Story Of A Girl),"[Chorus 1]
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 1]
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

[Chorus 1]
This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles
[Verse 2]
Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
Now how do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

[Pre-Chorus]
Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Listen, babe

Every time I see you, I get a bad vibe

And you thought you were slick, had tricks up your sleeve
But I'm sick of your stupid ass and I know you're tired of me

36,2000,Andy Griggs,She's More,"I like blue eyes, hers are green
Not like the woman of my dreams
And her hair's not quite as long as I had planned
Five foot three isn't tall
She's not the girl I'd pictured at all
In those paint by number
Fantasies I've had

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more

No, it wasn't at first sight
But the moment I looked twice
I saw the women I was born to love
Her laughter filled my soul
When I hold her I don't wanna let go
When it comes to her, I can't get enough

So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more!

More than I dreamed of
More than any man deserves...and I couldn't
Ask for a more than a love like hers
So it took me by complete suprise
When my heart got lost in those deep green eyes
She's not at all what I was lookin for, she's more"
37,2000,Vitamin C,Graduation (Friends Forever),"[Verse 1]
And so we talked all night about the rest of our lives
Where we're gonna be when we turn 25
Keep thinking times will never change
Keep on thinking things will always be the same (Be the same)
But when we leave this year we won't be coming back
No more hanging out cause we're on a different track
And if you got something that you need to say
You better say it right now cause you don't have another day (Another day)
'Cause we're moving on and we can't slow down
These memories are playing like a film without sound
And I keep thinking of that night in June
I didn't know much of love, but it came too soon (Came too soon)
And there was me and you, and then we got real blue
Stay at home talking on the telephone with me
We'd get so excited, we'd get so scared
Laughing at ourselves thinking life's not fair
And this is how it feels

[Chorus]
As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever
[Verse 2]
So if we get the big jobs, and we make the big money
When we look back now, will our jokes still be funny?
Will we still remember everything we learned in school?
Still be trying to break every single rule (Every rule)
Will little brainy Bobby be the stockbroker man?
Can Heather find a job that won't interfere with a tan?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (Goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly
And this is how it feels

As we go on
We remember
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever
We will still be
Friends forever

La, la, la, la...
Yeah, yeah, yeah
La, la, la, la...
We will still be friends forever
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?
Can we survive it out there?
Can we make it somehow? (Somehow)
I guess I thought that this would never end
And suddenly, it's like we're women and men
Will the past be a shadow that will follow us 'round?
Will these memories fade when I leave this town?
I keep, I keep thinking that it's not goodbye (It's not goodbye)
Keep on thinking it's a time to fly

[Chorus]
As we go on (Ooh)
We remember (We remember)
All the times we
Had together
And as our lives change
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (We will always be friends)

As we go on (As we go on)
We remember (Yeah)
All the times we (Yeah)
Had together (Ooh)
And as our lives change
Come whatever (Come whatever)
We will still be (Hey, yeah)
Friends forever
As we go on (We will always)
We remember (We will always remember)
All the times we

39,2000,Clay Walker,The Chain Of Love,"He was driving home one evening
In his beat up Pontiac
When an old lady flagged him down;
Her Mercedes had a flat
He could see that she was frightened
Standing out there in the snow
'Till he said ""I'm here to help you ma'am
By the way, my name's Joe.""

She said, ""I'm from St. Louis""
And I'm only passing through
I must've seen a hundred cars go by
This is awful nice of you.""

When he changed the tire, and closed her trunk
And was about to drive away
She said, ""How much do I owe you?""

Here's what he had to say:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you
Well a few miles down the road
The lady saw a small cafe
She went in to grab a bite to eat
And then be on her way
But she couldn't help but notice
How the waitress smiled so sweet
And how she must've been eight months along
And dead on her feet

No, she didn't know her story
And she probably never will
When the waitress went to get her change
From a hundred dollar bill
The lady slipped right out the door
And on a napkin left a note
There were tears in the waitress's eyes
When she read what she wrote:

You don't owe me a thing
I've been there too
And someone once helped me out
Just the way I'm helping you
If you really wanna pay me back
Here's what you do:
Don't let the chain of love end with you
That night when she got home from work
The waitress climbed into bed
She was thinking 'bout the money
And what the lady's note had said
As her husband lay there sleeping
She whispered soft and low:
""Everything's gonna be alright; I love you, Joe."""
40,2000,Donell Jones,Where I Wanna Be,"[Verse 1]
I just left my baby girl a message
Sayin' I won't be coming home
I'd rather be alone
She doesn't fully understand me
Cause I'd rather leave than to cheat
If she gives me some time
I can be the man she needs
But there's a lot of lust inside of me
And we've been together since our teenage years
I really don't mean to hurt her, but I need some time
To be alone

But when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
Oh, how I feel so sad
Now that I wanna leave

Where I wanna be
Where I wanna be...

Sweet little dee-do-dee-dee...
I don't mean to hurt you, baby, oh, no, no...

That you would play a major part
In a decision that's so hard
Do I leave, do I stay, do I go?
Or think about my life and what matters to me the most

But in time your heart will heal
I'm not saying I'm gone, but I
Have to find what life is like
Without you

Show me the meaning of being lonely

[Verse 1: Brian & AJ]
So many words for the broken heart
It is hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me

[Chorus: All]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart

[Verse 2: Kevin & Nick]
Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze, if only
Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)
There is no control, are you with me now?
Your every wish will be done
They tell me
[Chorus: All, AJ & Brian]
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are?
There is something missing in my heart (heart!)
[Bridge: Howie, All, AJ]
There is nowhere to run
I have no place to go
Surrender my heart, body, and soul
How can it be you are asking me
To feel the things you never show?
(Show-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh!)

[Interlude: Brian]
You are missing in my heart
Tell me why can't I be there where you are?

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with (tell me why)
Tell me why I can't be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart

Show me the meaning of being lonely (being lonely)
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I cannot be there where you are? (where you are)
There is something missing in my heart"

I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

[Verse 2]
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 3]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

[Verse 4]
Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[Chorus]
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean

49,2000,Clay Davidson,Unconditional,"Daddy waited up
In the kitchen by himself
I came stumbling in that night
With liquor on my breath
He said son I know u live here
But this is still my home
Its my way or the highway
So I said alright Im gone

Pre chorus:
And before i slammed that door
I said i hate u
He just shook his head
And said ok

Chorus:
But u can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given
As long as i am livin on this earth
One thing is true
U can turn away, forget me
Curse my name
But love will never let u go
Son my love is unconditional

Life is like a circle
Slowly turning on itself
But girl it took losing you
To finally know how bad it felt
We stood in this bedroom
A year ago today
Hangin onto pride and anger
As we threw our love away
Pre Chorus:
And before u slammed that door
U said i hate u
But tonightif u could only hear me say

Chorus:
U can't stop my love for u
Itll be here thats a given

I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there's nothing I can do, yeah

I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew, it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end

If I go crazy, then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there and holding my hand?

You called me strong, you called me weak
But still your secrets, I will keep
You took for granted all the times, I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground

51,2000,Kid Rock,Only God Knows Why,"[Verse 1]
I've been sittin' here tryin' to find myself
I get behind myself, I need to rewind myself
Lookin' for the payback, listen for the playback
They say that every man bleeds just like me
And I feel like number one, yet I'm last in line
I watch my youngest son and it helps to pass the time
I take too many pills that helps to ease the pain
I made a couple dollar bills, still I feel the same
Everybody knows my name they say it way out loud
A lot of folks fuck with me, it's hard to hang out in crowds
I guess that's the price you pay to be some big shot like I am
Outstretched hands and one night stands, still I can't find love

[Chorus]
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around
And when your walls come tumblin' down
I will always be around

[Verse 2]
People don't know 'bout the things I say and do
They don't understand about the shit I've been through
It's been so long since I've been home
I've been gone, I've been gone for way too long
Maybe I've forgot all the things I miss
Oh, somehow I know there's more to life than this
I've said it too many times and I still stand firm
You get what you put in and people get what they deserve
[Bridge]
Still I ain't seen mine
No, I ain't seen mine
I've been givin', just ain't been gettin'
I've been walkin' that there line

I keep movin' on and only God knows why

I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote ""Call for a good time""
And I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow
Besides you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud
How do you like me now?!

[Chorus]
How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way?
Do you still think I'm crazy
Standing here today?
I couldn’t make you love me
But I always dreamed about
Livin' in your radio
How do you like me now?!

[Verse 2]
When I took off to Tennessee
I heard that you made fun of me
Never imagined I'd make it this far
Then you married into money girl
Ain't it a cruel and funny world?
He took your dreams and he tore them apart
He never comes home
And you’re always alone
And your kids hear you crying down the hall
Alarm clock starts ringing
Who could that be singing?
It's me baby, with your wake-up call!
How do you like me now?!

How do you like me now?
Now that I'm on my way?

[Verse 1: Sting]
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand
I dream of fire
Those dreams are tied to a horse that will never tire
And in the flames
Her shadows play in the shape of a man's desire

This desert rose
Each of her veils, a secret promise
This desert flower
No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this

And as she turns
This way she moves in the logic of all my dreams
This fire burns
I realize that nothing's as it seems
I dream of rain
I dream of gardens in the desert sand
I wake in vain
I dream of love as time runs through my hand

I dream of rain
I lift my gaze to empty skies above
I close my eyes
This rare perfume is the sweet intoxication of her love

[Cheb Mami]
Aman aman aman

I dream of gardens in the desert sand

I dream of love as time runs through my hand

Sweet desert rose

No sweet perfume ever tortured me more than this
Sweet desert rose
This memory of Eden haunts us all
This desert flower
This rare perfume, is the sweet intoxication of the fall

I keep telling myself this is the right thing to do
I was wasting her time, waiting on dreams that just weren't coming true
And this old highway seems to understand
Leading me on to somewhere that no one knows my name
I got the window rolled down, I got the radio up
I'm doing all that I can to get my mind off us

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on, and on, and on

[Verse 2]
Eighty-seven more miles gets me into Baton Rogue
There's a buddy of mine who says he might find some work that I can do
Or maybe head up north to Knoxville, Tennessee
I know my baby sister, has got a couch where I can sleep
Now the sun's going down on my broken heart
Lord, I got to get back before I get too far

[Chorus]
What I need to do is turn this car around
Drive as fast as I can 'til I see the lights of our hometown
And run to her, take her in my arms
Make her see how sorry I am, well that shouldn't be so hard
But I drive on
Yes I drive on, and on, and on

59,2000,Son By Four,Purest Of Pain (A Puro Dolor),"Sorry didn't mean to call you but i couldn't fight it
I guess i was weak, couldn't even hide it
And so i surrendered, just to hear your voice

Don't know how many times i said i'm gonna live without you
And maybe someone else is standing there beside you
But there's something, baby you need to know
That deep inside me, i feel like i'm dying. i have to see you, it's all that i'm asking

(chorus)
Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live
The air that i breathe
Cari?o mio, my world's become so empty. the days are so cold and lonely
And each night i taste the purest of pain

Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla
Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida
Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol

Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte. agonizando, muy lento y muy fuerte

Vida, devuelveme mis fantasias, mis ganas de vivir la vida, devuelveme el aire
Cari?o mio, sin tin yo me siento vacio, las tardes son un laberinto, las noches
Me saben, a puro dolor

(chorus) (repeat chorus again softly)
Vida, give me back my fantasy. the courage that i need to live

60,2000,Mya Featuring Jadakiss,Best Of Me,"[Intro: Jadakiss, Mýa (Jadakiss)]
Uh, huh
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha
Yo, yo
Woah, put it on me
I can't let (Nah, yeah)
Let him go no (I just wanna do what's best for you)
Can't let you get, oh no (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Mýa]
He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out (Oh no)
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
[Chorus]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me)

[Verse 2: Mýa]
So is he trying to play with my head?
Tellin' me how he could blow my mind
Somethin' 'bout the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hand's up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
[Chorus (Jadakiss)]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me, Yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss (Mýa)]
I got so many bags of money that they won't fit in the bank
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'mma make sure both y'all win
Let him keep the place, you move and I'mma pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge
You know, literally, we could go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she ain't wanna get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look (Put it on me)
Channel look, mixed with the Pete Arnell look
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city (Put it on me)
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty, we livin' it up
I put it on your ass if you're givin' it up
And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you call him up later
And tell him you all Jada's
[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you (Oh no)
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside (I can't let you)
Something's dying to see (No)
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me (Baby even though)
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

[Chorus]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me
Oh yeah, oh...

But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me"
61,2000,George Strait,The Best Day,"We loaded up my old station wagon
With a tent, a Coleman, and sleeping bags
Some fishing poles, a cooler of cokes
Three days before we had to be back

When you're seven you're in seventh heaven
When you're going camping in the wild outdoors
As we turned up on that old dirt road
He looked at me and swore

Dad, this could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night about the fun we've had
Just me and you doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

His fifteenth birthday rolled around
Classic cars were his thing
When I pulled in the drive with that old 'vette
I thought that boy would go in sane

When you're in your teens
Your dreams revolve around four spinning wheels
You worked nights on end
'Till it was new again
And as he sat behind the wheel
He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
About the fun we've had
Just me and you
Doing what I've always wanted to
I'm the luckiest boy alive
This is the best day of my life

Standing in a little room
Back of the church with our tuxes on
Looking at him I say I can't believe son that you're grown

He said Dad
This could be the best day of my life
I've been dreaming day and night
Of being like you
Now its me and her
Watching you and mom I've learned
I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life

I'm the luckiest man alive
This is the best day of my life"
62,2000,Tim McGraw,Some Things Never Change,"[Verse 1]
After all this time I still miss you every day
The same world spins 'round
I guess some things never change
Sometimes I go out but it never feels the same
I still look for you
Baby some things never change

[Verse 2]
When I said I'd love you for eternity
I just never knew how true those words would be
Just an old love song
Just a mention of your name
My heart breaks in two again
I guess some things never change

[Verse 3]
Maybe someday someone else will set me free
Until then I'll live with your loves legacy
And I'll keep holding on
Hoping you'll come back someday
You can rest assured
Baby some things never change
Girl I'm still in love with you
I guess some things never change
[Outro]
I still love you"

Why lie? See for yourself when I slide through
Drive by, your bitch say don't look, you do

You wish boo boo could ride with you tonight

And you still be sweating me

But nigga just let me breathe
Damn, you cute as hell so let's switch the digits
Then I got to leave
And you can buy me a couple of drinks
But I'mma go socialize and smoke my weed
And I like it when you keep your eyes on me
And I like it when you touch my privacy
And I like it sex and ecstasy
When the belt buckle loosen up, undress me
Already juiced up, that come naturally
Wax on and off so romantically
No woman can slow dance or throw down like I can
Ask if you curious to know what I like, man

Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon

Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now?
Not where we want to be

Still follow me

Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you

Someday we would live again someday soon

You can catch me in the cherry red one-fifty
Got the Glizzy locked in the stizzy
Pop the clizzy, going sixty down a one-wizzy
Drunk pissy, tryin' to cruise through the avenue
While my peoples is poppin' bottles up in Sue's Rendevous
Fuck that! Spun the U-ey, lost a hubcap
It's back to the shack, came back in a ""What's that?""
Straight from Paris, checkin' Gaby's new baby carriage
Perry Ellis, auburn cherry reddish
Fresh out the dealer, got the TEC for the squealers
Wear a vest for the killers, nothin' less, ‘cause it's realer
In the Big Apple, where it's quick to get your shit tackled
Enemies spit at you, best friends kidnap you
Trust no one; got beef, bust yo' gun
You don't need no one talking 'bout that you owe him
I'ma go for dolo; Scarface without Manolo
One deep, I be solo, bustin' heat, throwin' bolos, it's hard

[Hook: Donnell Jones]
And it's so hard, yeah
Niggas wanna be like Pun
But they don't bust they guns

Rollin' with the Squad, we like Gods
Catch us at the bar-de-bar-de-bars, strip bars in Miami
Almost came home with the Grammy

Watch me, you can catch it live on the Hitachi
Poppin' shit like a Nazi, iced out like DeBiase
Fuck that! Liberace, fo'-X Versace, somebody stop me!
Never that! SKEE-YU! Where my niggas at?
Uptown, uptown, you know you feelin' that
Cash rule, hardcore you can dance to
That old Biggie give me, One More Chance
Take a glance and I'm off with yours
With both hands take off my drawers
And jerk me like the Source Awards
I love hip-hop, I ain't even probably the best lyricist alive
Terror Squad, nigga, stop sleepin'!

Yeah, you ain't fucking my wife, takin' my life
And if you just hatin', just walk on by
All you haters just walk on by

We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holla
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs in renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies looking proper
Look good enough to be taken shopping
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night (End of the night, babe)
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearing my medallion

Since I stepped foot on my old stomping ground
I ended up by the old school yard
When this red head pulled up in a blue sports car

It took a second to put it all together and I said

Finally got a couple out on country radio

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 1]
When we hooked up we sat down
Made an agreement, we vowed that
That we'd always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never ever leave us
That was a while ago
But now lately it feels like
I mean I feel like all we do is fight
Every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back, take it way back
All the way back, can we start again
Do it over, can we straighten it out
Can we work it out, cuz...
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Do you realize
I can't sleep without you, think without you
Eat without you, speak without you, be without you
I can't even breathe without you...
I can't feel with out you, deal without you, spend without you
My whole world is upside down...
Don't wanna go out cuz I can't ride without you
Feelin like I'm gon' die without you
What is a girl supposed to do?
When I spend my last dime to be in your life
I don't wanna be without you
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

[Bridge]
How can this be (that it's not workin out)
That it's not workin out
We vowed to be always together
It's hurting me that we don't talk no more
It's not supposed to be this way
Where did we go wrong
We both made mistakes, but gotta carry on

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be...
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live...
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go...
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

Don't wanna live, no.... No.....
You're long gone
Baby come home..."

I'm in the middle of the sweetest dream
When I hear that alarm clock calling me
I wrestle with the feeling
That the day is starting way too soon
I hit the button just to buy a little time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes

I love the way the sunlight
Dances on your perfect skin
Girl, I wish this night would never end
But we gotta get moving
You can't eat if you don't get paid
But I got us a better idea
Just pull up the covers and stay right here

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
For another nine minutes
I hit the button just one more time
To keep you in these arms of mine

For another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
'Cause this is my dream and I wanna stay in it
Oh yeah, for another nine minutes, let the world wait
Who's gonna care if we're a little bit late
This is my dream and I'm gonna stay in it
Oh, for another nine

Another nine minutes, let the world stop
Steal a few moments from this old clock
Another nine minutes, let the world wait

I was standing in the grocery store line
The one they marked express
When this woman came through with about 25 things
And I said don't you know that more is less
She said this world is moving so fast
I just get more behind with every day
And every morning when I make my coffee
I can't believe my life's turned out this way

Big enough for all the pain in the world
Love's the only house

And baby you can't have me now

And I found out the hard way that

You drive three miles from all this prosperity
Down across the river and you see a ghetto there
And we got children walking around with guns
And they got knives and drugs and pain to spare
And here I am in my clean white shirt
With a little money in my pocket and a nice warm home
And we got teenagers walking around in a culture of darkness
Living together alone, all I can say is

And I can't explain it and I can't understand
But I'll come down and get my hands dirty
And together we'll make a stand

City streets are going burn if we don't do something soon
And señorita can't quit crying
Baby's due now any day

No one there to show him the way
She came down to the grocery store
And she said I want to buy a little carton of milk
But I don't have any money

Because the pain's got to go somewhere
Yeah the pain's got to go someplace

It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

A blanket like the ozone

It's nothing as it seems
All that he needs
It's home
The little that he frees is nothing he believes

Something maybe two tone
Anything of his own
A chip off the corner stone
Who's kidding?
Rainy day
A one way ticket headstone
Occupations overthrown
Whisper through a megaphone

It's nothing as it seems
The little that he needs
It's home
The little that he sees
Is nothing he concedes
It's home

And all that he frees

Mary Anne and Wanda were the best of friends
All through their high school days
Both members of the 4H Club
Both active in the FFA
After graduation Mary Anne went out
Lookin' for a bright new world
Wanda looked all around this town
And all she found was Earl

[Verse 2]
Well it wasn't two weeks after she got married
That Wanda started gettin' abused
She put on dark glasses and long sleeved blouses
And makeup to cover a bruise
Well she finally got the nerve to file for divorce
She let the law take it from there
But Earl walked right through that restraining order
And put her in intensive care

[Pre-Chorus]
Right away, Mary Anne flew in from Atlanta
On a red-eye midnight flight
She held Wanda's hand and they worked out a plan
And it didn't take 'em long to decide
[Chorus]
That Earl had to die
Goodbye, Earl
Those black-eyed peas
They tasted all right to me, Earl
You're feeling weak
Why don't you lay down and sleep, Earl?
Ain't it dark
Wrapped up in that tarp, Earl?

[Verse 3]
The cops came by to bring Earl in
They searched the house high and low
Then they tipped their hats
And said ""Thank You ladies, if you hear from him let us know""

Well the weeks went by and
Spring turned to summer
And summer faded into fall
And it turns out he was a missing person
Who nobody missed at all

So the girls bought some land at a roadside stand
Out on Highway 109
They sell Tennessee ham
And strawberry jam
And they don't lose any sleep at night, 'cause...

Earl had to die
Goodbye Earl
We need a break
Let's go out to the lake, Earl
We'll pack a lunch
And stuff you in the trunk, Earl
Well, is that all right?
Good, let's go for a ride Earl

I love you

So SAY those 3 little words I wanna hear
I love you"
97,2000,Darryl Worley,When You Need My Love,"Two in the mornin', telephone rings
Somehow I knew it who was
Cause baby it's always the same old thing
When you need my love

You say it's over again and again
This time you've had enough
Girl, I know you've been fightin' with him
When you need my love

Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart

He'll call tomorrow with the same old lines
And you'll forget about us
And I'll be lonely until the next time
When you need my love

Chorus:
Oh I wish I could just say no
And get you out of my heart
It must be nice to have someplace to go
When your world falls apart
Now someday, someone's gonna love me true
And baby when she does
Then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

Yeah then I wonder what you're gonna do
When you need my love

When you need my love

When you need my love
What are you gonna do
Ohhhhh"

99,2000,Tracy Lawrence,Lessons Learned,"[Verse 1]
I was ten years old the day I got caught
With some dime store candy that I never bought
I hung my head and I faced the wall
As Daddy showed me wrong from right
He said this hurts me more than it does you
There's just some things son, that you just don't do
Is anything I'm sayin' getting through
Said Daddy I can see the light

Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns
Oh, lessons learned

[Verse 2]
Granddaddy was a man I loved
He bought me my first ball and glove
Even taught me how to drive his truck
Circling that ol' town square
He spoke of life with a slow southern drawl
I never heard him cause I knew it all
But I sure listened when I got the call
That he was no longer there
[Refrain]
Oh, lessons learned, man, they sure run deep
They don't go away and they don't come cheap
Oh, there's no way around it, 'cause this world turns

Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Where they at? Where they at?
Come on, now

[Chorus: Nelly]
If you wanna go and take a ride with me
We 3-wheeling in the fo' with the gold D's
Oh, why do I live this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)
If you wanna go and get high with me
Smoke a L in the back of the Benz-E
Oh, why must I feel this way?
(Hey, must be the money!)

[Verse 1: Nelly]
In the club on the late night, feeling right
Looking, trying to spot something real nice
Looking for a little shorty I noticed so that I can take home
(I can take home) She can be
18 (18) with an attitude
Or 19, kinda snotty, acting real rude
But as long as you a thicy-thicy-thic girl you know that it's on
(You know that it's on) I peep something
Coming towards me on the dance floor, sexy and real slow
Saying she was peeping and I dig the last video
""So when Nelly, can we go?"" How could I tell her no?
Her measurements was 36-25-34, yelling
""I like the way you brush your hair
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you, boo, from way over there""

Oh, why must I feel this way?

Face and body Frontenac, don't know how to act
Without no vouchers on her boots she's bringing nothing back
You should feel the impact, shop on plastic
When the sky's the limit and them haters can't get past that
Watch me as I gas that 4 dot 6 Range
Watch the candy paint change, every time I switch lanes
It feel strange now, making a living off my brain
Instead of 'caine now, I got the title from my
Momma put the whip in my own name now, damn shit done
Changed now, running credit checks with no shame now
I feel the fame now (come on), I can't complain now (no more)
Shit I'm the mayne now, in and out my own town
I'm getting pages out of New Jersey from Courtney B
Telling me about a party up in NYC
And can I make it? Damn right, I be on the next flight
Paying cash; first class - sitting next to Vanna White, c'mon

Popping like we drug dealers, sipping Chrissy, bubb' macking

Yes ma, Bed-Stuy, Fiesta
Remix with the homie from the Midwest side
Game recognize game, hoes do too
It's the new 2 Live Crew, I suppose you knew
So thugs, pop yo' toasters but don't approach us or
Bullets'll chase you like Moet mimosas
Catch us both coasts, racin' twin Porsches
Boxes with Glocks that'll pop ya to make ya ghost-es
Whoever come closest you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture till the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin' till six in the mornin'
In the back of the club with ma, ma
Poppin' bottles of Cris with ma, ma
Put the bar on the tab for ma, ma
Throwin' hundreds up for grabs for ma, ma
'Cause it's about to go down tonight
I'ma be drinkin' till the early liz-ight

And if you rollin' on them things then you feel this shit
If you drunk off in the club then you feel this shit
If you see a motherfuckin' thug then you feel this shit

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Verse 2]
I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me
And it's not so bad, it's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
Then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in her hair
She acts like summer and walks like rain
Reminds me that there's a time to change, hey
Since the return of her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey
Hey, hey-yeah

[Chorus]
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights all faded
And that heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall from a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

[Verse 2]
Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation, hey, mmm
She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, hey, yeah
Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land
[Chorus]
But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself out there?

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet? (Feet)
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along the light of day (Light of day)
And head back toward the Milky Way?

Looking for yourself?

Boys and girls, wanna hear a true story?
Saturday night I was at this real wild party
They had the liquor overflowing the cup
About five or six strippers tryna work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancin' for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry?
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smokin' rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Girl, you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be livin' all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hopin' to die

Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I done been through more [shit] that you can't even relate to""

Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Which one? Pick one, this one, classic
Red from blonde, yeah, bitch, I'm drastic
Why this, why that, lips stop askin'
Listen to me, baby, relax and start passin'
Expressway, hair back, weaving through the traffic
This one strong, should be labeled as a hazard
Some of y'all niggas hot, psych, I'm gassin'
Clowns, I spot 'em and I can't stop laughin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year

Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster, too much to eat
Snakes in my path wanna smile up at me (Huh)

Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration, baby, you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Ain't no stress when it comes to stage, get what you see
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, 16's mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
All I do is contemplate ways to make your fans mine
Eyes bloodshot, stressing, chills up your spine
Huh, sick to your stomach wishing I wrote your rhymes

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
I knew I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Let your bones crack
Your back pop, I can't stop
Excitement, Glock shots from your stash spot
Fuck it, thugged out, I respect the cash route
Glocked down, blasters, sets while I mash out
Yeah, nigga, mash out, D-R-E, huh
Backtrack, make that, E-V-E
Do you like that? (Ew) You got to I know you
Had you in a trance first glance from the floor too
Don't believe, I'll show you, take you with me
Turn you on, tension gone, give you relief
Put your trust in a bomb when you listen to me
Damn, she much thinner know now I'm complete (Uh-huh)
Still stallion, brick house, pile it on
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
Beware, 'cause I crush anything I land on
Me here, ain't no mistake, nigga, it was planned on

And I, I can't help but ask myself
How much I let the fear take the wheel and steer

Will I choose water over wine
And hold my own and drive?

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion
And I can't get enough

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you
That don't do something for me
The way you kiss, the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There ain't nothing 'bout you (Nothing 'bout you)
That don't do something for me

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby, it's no mystery
Why I surrender

The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There ain't nothing 'bout you

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice

[Verse 2]
To this day I still taste that first kiss
How I prayed it wouldn't end
In a way, seeing you like this
I guess it never really did

[Chorus]
We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
In that clear September sky
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something that just don't happen twice
[Verse 3]
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
3 am I fell in love
For the first time in my life
Oh that's something, baby that's something
Oh that's something
That just don't happen twice

Oh yeah

We sang Bobby McGhee on the hood of my car
Made a wish on every star
One bottle of wine and two Dixie cups
Yeah we fell in love"
126,2001,Tim McGraw,Grown Men Don't Cry,"[Verse 1]
I pulled into the shopping centre
And saw a little boy wrapped around the legs of his mother
Like ice cream melting they embraced
Years of bad decisions running down her face
All morning I would been thinking my life is so hard
And they wore everything they own, living in a car
I wanted to tell him it would be ok
But I got just got in my suburban and I drove away

[Chorus]
But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

[Verse 2]
Keep having this dream about my old man
I am 10 years old, and he is holding my hand
We are talking on the front porch watching the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he could not be around
So many things I want to say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

[Chorus]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry
[Verse 3]
I am sitting here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the Lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it is up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
""I haven't had my story yet""

And everything weighing on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says
""I love you dad""

[Chorus x2]
And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

And I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry"
127,2001,Lee Ann Womack,I Hope You Dance,"[Verse 1]
I hope you never lose your sense of wonder
You get your fill to eat, but always keep that hunger
May you never take one single breath for granted
God forbid love ever leave you empty-handed

[Verse 2]
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

[Chorus]
I hope you dance
I hope you dance

[Verse 3]
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance
Never settle for the path of least resistance
Livin' might mean takin' chances but they're worth takin'
Lovin' might be a mistake but it's worth makin'

[Verse 4]
Don't let some hell-bent heart leave you bitter
When you come close to sellin' out, reconsider
Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance
[Chorus]
I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)
I hope you dance (And wonder where those years have gone?)

[Bridge:]
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean
Whenever one door closes, I hope one more opens
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance

Dance

I hope you dance (Time is a wheel in constant motion)
I hope you dance (Always rolling us along)
I hope you dance (Tell me, who wants to look back on their years)

Girl: Peace!

[Verse 1]
Come home late it seems you barely beat the sun
Tapping my shoulder thinking you gonna get you some
Smelling like some fragrance that I don't even wear
So If you want some loving I suggest you go back there
Where you came from
Day to day with you it's always something else
Working my nerve God knows that I don't deserve
What you put me through cause I been so true to you
For you to come at me with another lame excuse

See I

What were you thinking bringing her into our home
In our bed, you must have fell and bumped your head
Messing up my sheets and violating me
Have me 'bout to call my peeps and take it to the streets
Nothing you can do and there's nothing you can say
That could persuade me to stay with you another day
You have crossed the line to the point of no return
What you do from here on out, I am no longer concerned

[Chorus]
See I
Heard it all before

""Let me explain, baby, it's not what you think""

130,2001,Madonna,What It Feels Like For A Girl,"[Spoken Sample: Charlotte Gainsbourg]
Girls can wear jeans
And cut their hair short
Wear shirts and boots
Because it's OK to be a boy
But for a boy to look like a girl is degrading
'Cause you think that being a girl is degrading
But secretly you'd love to know what it's like
Wouldn't you?
What it feels like for a girl

[Verse 1: Madonna]
Silky smooth
Lips as sweet as candy, baby
Tight blue jeans
Skin that shows in patches

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
[Verse 2: Madonna]
Hair that twirls on finger tips so gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips, repenting

[Pre-Chorus]
Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
What it feels like for a girl?

[Pre-Chorus: Madonna]
Strong inside, but you don't know it
Good little girls, they never show it
When you open up your mouth to speak
Could you be a little weak?

[Chorus: Madonna]
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world
For a girl?
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
Do you know what it feels like in this world?

[Outro: Madonna]
For a girl
In this world
Do you know
Do you know
Do you know what it feels like for a girl?
What it feels like in this world?"

You know
I don't know what it is (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Don't you try and tell me that he's not my type
To hide what I feel inside
When he makes me weak with desire (With desire)

Let him think I like the chase
But I can't stop fanning the fire

That I should really say goodnight

What would I be without my baby?
The thought alone might break me
And I don't wanna go crazy
But every thug needs a lady

Girl, it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind, body and soul ain't no I in we (Baby)
When you cry, who wipes your tears?
When you scared, who's telling you there's nothin' to fear?
Girl, I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on
Never hesitate knowing you can call on your soul-mate
And vice versa, that's why I be the first to
See, Jacob's and frost your wrist up

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks and gifts that you cop me, baby
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm?
When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy, we been down since junior high
So when life get hot in July, it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and never
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely
So baby boy, put it on me

Since we met, it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby, eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gon' cry
If you leave me lonely
'Cause you not just my love, you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love?
I'm outta control, hold me, my love
'Cause I'm yours

If this was our world, it'd be all yours, baby
The thought alone might break me

He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

[Chorus 1]
I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

[Verse 2]
She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes
[Chorus 2]
I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind
And I'll be there until the end
Can you feel the love that we share
Oh I'm already there

We may be a thousand miles apart
But I'll be with you wherever you are

Take a look around

Ever since the first moment I spoke your name
From then on I knew that by you being in my life
Things were destined to change 'cause

[Chorus]
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Verse 2]
Many days I've longed for you
Wanting you
Hoping for the chance to get to know you
Longing for your kiss
For your touch, your feel, your Presence
Many nights I've cried from the things you do
Felt like I could die from the thought of losing you
I know that you're real
With no doubts and no fears
And no questions
[Chorus]
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

[Bridge]
At first you didn't mean that much to me, no
But now I know you're all I need
The world looks so brand new to me
Now that I found love
Everyday I live for you, yeah
And everything that I do, I do it for you
What I say is how I feel so believe it's true
You got to know I'm true

[Chorus]
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first
Love
So many people use your name in vain
Love
Those who have faith in you sometimes go astray
Love
Through all the ups and downs the joys and hurts
Love
For better or worse I still will choose you first

138,2001,Dream,This Is Me,"This is me (this is me, this is me...)

She stole your heart
Only did it because she could
Chewed you up and spat you out
That girl never was no good (no good)
Baby I will never do that
I'll love you faithfully

139,2001,Travis Tritt,It's A Great Day To Be Alive,"[Verse 1]
I got rice cookin' in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta say, hey
I'm doin' alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
I'm feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced, no
I'm just doin' alright

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Verse 3]
It's been fifteen years since I left home
And said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Gave it my best and then I left it alone
I hope they're doin' alright

[Verse 4]
Now I look in the mirror and what do I see
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doing alright
[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

[Bridge]
Sometimes it's lonely, sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room
Sometimes I'm falling, desperately calling
Howlin' at the moon ah-ooh

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 5]
Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a Fu-Manchu

[Chorus]
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shining
When I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood

And it's been awhile since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhile since I first saw you
And it's been awhile since I could stand on my own two feet again
And it's been awhile since I could call you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

[Verse 2]
And it's been awhile since I could say that I wasn't addicted and
It's been awhile since I could say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile since I've gone and fucked things up, just like I always do
And it's been awhile, but all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

[Bridge]
Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day
[Verse 3]
And it's been awhile since I could look at myself straight
And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile since I've seen the way the candles light your face
And it's been awhile, but I can still remember just the way you taste

[Chorus]
And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, and I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

And it's been awhile since I said I'm sorry"

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
Destination New Orleans
Boss man says my big promotion's on the line
He says that's right where I need to be
Lately I've been on the road more than I've been home
All this leaving her alone is killing me
And holding her right now has got me thinkin' more and more
This is right where I need to be

[Chorus]
Where when I hear her I can see her
I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her
Anytime that I want to
Yeah that's right where I need to be
Yeah that's right where I need to be

There's a plane flying out of here tonight
With an empty first class seat
Because I've finally got all my priorities in line
And I'm right where I need to be

I can smell her sweet perfume
I can feel her skin against me when I sleep
Where I won't miss her I can kiss her

Said we cry, cry, cry, we cry together, oh, oh

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
I love my life, I love my wife, a bad time to prevail
It overwhelmed me, I'm livin' in hell but livin' wealthy
And know these hoes love me because I'm a star
I can't even cop a drink at the bar
Get me some bottles of that Remi Martin, let's get the party
Cracking right here, fuck V.I.P. 
Knowing my baby loves me, home with tears in her eyes
And when I get in, I hurt her more by tellin' her lies
She ain't surprised at me, she just surprised that we
Been together for this long and I can be
The one to mistreat her, thought it'd last forever
'Cause if I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
From what I recall, we was little niggas
Cuttin' school, gettin' high with the hottest bitches
Livin' life so free, that we ain't fearin' the
Ills of the world and the heat of drug dealin'
You and I then made a killin', and stuck together
In this land of forbidden treasure
Love is the only evil seed that could sever a tie this close
Not the love between us, but your love for the dough
You went O.T., started makin' M-O-N-E, why
All my good niggas gotta die?
But shit could last forever, I wish death was pleasure
'Cause when you died, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

Wash away your tears, my love
You ain't gotta cry no more, my love
I put it on everything that I love
That my pain is my love
[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
And I want this world to smile for me
Don't shed a tear, 'cause a nigga died happily
My mama warned me life was a motherfucker
But I ignored the warning and kept on hustlin'
And every night she just looked at me, tears in her eyes
And they be saying shit like, ""I don't want me baby to die""
Brought so much pain to her life, gotta make it better
'Cause when ma cried, I cried, we cried together

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
When I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together
I said I cry, you cry, we cry together

[Outro: Lil' Mo]
Ooh, you cry, then I cry, then we cry
When he cries, I cry, together, together
When I cry, then you cry, then we'll cry together
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, baby
'Cause when Ja cries, Mo cries, we'll cry together
If he cry, then I'll cry, then we'll cry together, yeah

Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

[Verse 1]
Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce, you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passin', I'm askin', ""Could this be real?""
'Cause I can't sleep, I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel, too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up when these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found ever since you've been around
You're the woman that I want, so yo, I'm puttin' it down

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy
[Verse 2]
I don't deserve you unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious, then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused, twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed, but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild, I was livin' like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happenin' now?
I see the sun breakin' down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standin' out in a crowd, so

[Chorus]
Come my lady, come-come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady, you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake, you make me go crazy

Hey sugar mama, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl, me and you's like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil
Talkin' 'bout butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you, miss

150,2001,matchbox twenty,Mad Season,"[Verse 1]
I feel stupid
But I know it won't last for long
And I've been guessing
And I could have been guessing wrong
You don't know me now
I kinda thought that you should some how
Does that whole mad season got you down?

[Verse 2]
Well I feel stupid
But it's something that comes and goes
And I've been changing
I think it's funny how no one knows
We don't talk about
The little things that we do without
When that whole mad season comes around

[Pre-Chorus]
So, why ya gotta stand there looking like the answer now?
It seems to me you'll come around

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season
[Verse 3]
I feel stupid
But I think I've been catching on
I feel ugly
But I know I still turn you on
You've grown colder now
Torn apart, angry, turned around
What that whole mad season knock you down?

[Pre-Chorus]
So are you gonna stand there, are you gonna help me out?
We need to be together now

[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come undone, in this mad season

[Bridge]
And now I'm crying, isn't that what you want?
And I'm trying to live my life on my own, but I won't, no
At times I do believe I am strong
So someone tell me why, why, why
Do I, I, I
Feel stupid
And I come undone
Well I come undone
[Chorus]
I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, that I'm lost and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken

[Chorus]
Well I need you now, do you think you can cope?
You figured me out, I'm a child and I'm hopeless
I'm bleeding and broken, though I've never spoken
I come, oh, I come undone, in this mad season

[Outro]
In this mad season
It's been a mad season
Been a mad season"
151,2001,George Strait,If You Can Do Anything Else,"[Verse 1]
Would you like to live in Houston, where the cowboys come to town
Or maybe Pensacola, where the sun shines all year 'round
Or even New York City, where the city never sleeps
I'm offering you the option before you get in too deep

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Verse 2]
There's work up in Seattle, if you don't mind the rain
San Diego to Savannah, they'd all be glad you came
But life with me would always be a roller coaster ride
You won't hurt my feelings, whatever you decide

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here
[Bridge]
This place might look real good right now, but looking good don't last
But if you choose it, anyhow, I'll give you all I have

[Chorus]
If you can do anything else, baby, be good to yourself
You can find a nice place, have a good life
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm gonna be alright
You can make a new start, you can see yourself clear
If you can do anything else, do it
But if you can't, baby, you can you stay right here

[Outro]
Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Oh, baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else, baby be good to yourself)
Baby, you can stay right here (if you can do anything else)"

Hey, j-j-jaded, you got your mama's style
But you're yesterday's child to me
So jaded
You think that's where it's at
But is that where it's supposed to be
You're getting it all over me, ex-rated

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I been thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
And I'm the one that jaded you

[Verse 2]
Hey j-j-jaded, in all it's misery
It will always be what I love and hated
And maybe take a ride to the other side
We're thinking of
We'll slip into the velvet glove
And be jaded

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm thinking about you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I'm so jaded
And baby, I'm afraid of you
[Verse 3]
Your thinking's so complicated
I've had it all up to here
But it's so overrated
Love and hated
Wouldn't trade it
Love me jaded

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Hey, j-j-jaded
There ain't no baby, please
When I'm shooting the breeze with her
When everything you see is a blur
And ecstasy's what you prefer

[Chorus]
My, my baby blue
I'ma talking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, I've been thinking 'bout you
My, my baby blue
Yeah, you're so jaded
(Baby)
Jaded
(Baby)
You're so jaded
'Cause I'm the one that jaded you"
153,2001,Montgomery Gentry,She Couldn't Change Me,"Sometime I think what turned her on
Was my old broke down boots
She wanted her a real cowboy
It was a phase she was goin' through

But not one week after she moved in
I caught her paintin' the bedroom blue
She brought home a bottle of pink Chablis
And poured out my best brew

I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
While she packed her things to leave
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She changed direction headed out west
Changed her tune to some hip-hop mess
Her dark brown hair went blonde
And her pretty blue eyes went green
She changed everything when she couldn't change me

She was sittin' beside the ocean
Looking out at the waves
Watching how they keep on rollin'
But always seem the same

She called and said she'd been thinkin' about
All those quiet country nights
And whatever she thought was so wrong with me
Suddenly seemed all right
I was sittin' on the porch in my overalls
When her truck pulled into view
She said I changed my mind when I couldn't change you

She changed direction headed back home
She changed her tune it's all Haggard and Jones
She had her dark brown hair pulled back
And blue eyes like you've never seen
She changed her mind when she couldn't change me

She said I guess when you love someone you just gotta let it be
Yeah, she changed her mind when she couldn't change me"

That led you to my door
You say the night's got you acting crazy

Until you shook my tree
Nobody runs from the law now baby
Of love and gravity it pulls you so strong
Baby you gotta hold on

Do you mind if I tell the truth for a second, yall?

[Verse 1]
Maybe I deserve..
To wonder who's calling so damn late
For you to say I'm tripping, just a homie from upstate
(said it's just a homie)
Don't he know its one o' clock in the mornin'
You say baby its cool (baby its cool)
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say he's comin' into town (later on this evenin')
You was just wondering if you and him can hang out
I don't like it, but I know I gotta trust you
It ain't cool cause I know it's true

For you to go out and find some other guy
Maybe I deserve..
For you to stay out with him all night
Maybe I deserve..
For you to do all the things I did to you

For you to put on a sexy dress
For me to ask you ""who the hell you tryna impress?""
(""Who the hell you tryna impress?"")
For you to laugh it off like it ain't nothin'
I know its somethin'
(maybe, just maybe)
Maybe I deserve..
To sit at home and wonder where you are
Is he kissin' you, touchin' you, holdin' you, what?
To take a drink to help ease my mind
I wanna be mad (wanna be)
After all those times (after all those times)

For you to say ""I better stop trippin'""
Maybe I deserve..
To grab your neck until you let me know
Maybe I deserve..
For you to run cryin', cryin' out the door
Maybe I deserve..
To grab my coat, and chase you down the street
Maybe I deserve..
To say its not you, it's my own insecurities
Maybe I deserve..
For you to say ""yes I cheated on you""
(""Yes I cheated on you"")
Maybe I deserve..
And I won't care cause after all I put you through

Maybe I deserve-serve...yeah
To be mistreated sometimes
Maybe I deserve..
To even be, lied to sometimes..
Maybe, maybe you should go cheat on me too"

I know when he's been on your mind
That distant look is in your eyes
I thought with time you'd realize
It's over, over
It's not the way I choose to live
And something somewhere's got to give
As sharing this relationship
Gets older, older

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'd fight for you
But how can I fight someone who isn't even there?
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
I don't care if that's not fair

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's no where left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all

[Verse 2]
There are times it seems to me
I'm sharing you in memories
I feel it in my heart, but I don't show it, show it
And then there's times you look at me
As though I'm all that you can see
There's times I don't believe it's right
I know it, know it
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me promises
Baby, you never did know how to keep them well
I've had the rest of you, now I want the best of you
It's time to show and tell

[Chorus]
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing

[Bridge]
'Cause you and I
Could lose it all if you've got no more room
Nowhere, inside, for me in your life
'Cause I want it all or nothing at all
There's nowhere left to fall
It's now or never

[Chorus]
Is it all or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?
You leave me here, with nothing at all
Or nothing at all?
There's nowhere left to fall
When you reach the bottom, it's now or never
Is it all, or are we just friends?
Is this how it ends, with a simple telephone call?

160,2001,Toya,I Do!!,"[Verse 1:]
He was a six foot stallion
Said a storybook thug
He was the kind
That made you wonder how he put down the love
He had a hickey in his pocket
A phat rock in his ear
He made my heart stop pulpitating
Every time he came near
He has a spanking new Range for that tight wardrobe
His pants was saggin
He was plaided
And his head was cornrows
He has his wrists bling-blinging
And his long legs was bow
He tried to push up on me
But I knew he had me at go

[Chorus x2:]
I do
I wonder if you feel the same way I do
I can see it in your eyes
I entice you
So come on, shorty
If you think you can roll
With an iced out playa
Balling out of control

[Verse 2:]
Me and my crew started grooving
Made our way to the floor
It's time to activate my plan
And give this hottie a show
I shook my hips
Took a dip
Roll my tongue 'cross my lips
And when he took his place to dance wit me
I felt fingertips on the small of my back
So I had to react like I was playing hard to get
And told that boy to step back
But when I looked deep in his eyes
All I could see was his soul
I'm 'bout to make this guy my man
That I can tell you
Fa 'sho
[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge x2:]
Watch me
Drop, drop
Shake it
For the fellas who know
Watch me pop
Pop my hips
As I dip and roll
Watch me stop
Stop traffic as I walk through the room
Knowing all the papi's want me
But all I want is you

Seems so long
When it's just you, you can't see through
Those old clouds that rain so blue

But when somebody loves you
There's nothing you can't do
When somebody loves you
It's easy to get through
When somebody loves you

By yourself, nowhere to go
Sing a song, you dance alone
Play solitaire and stare at the phone

And let our hearts say hello
We both agree we're just no good
At being on our own

Until then wake up
Better yet, better get
Better get over yourself

(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes ""You'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you're owed

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
[Verse 2]
While he was braggin'
I was coming down the hill just draggin'
All his pictures and his clothes in a bag and
Sold everything else 'til there was just nothing left
And I paid, all the bills about a month too late
It's a shame we have to play these games
The love we had just fade away, away

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oops!) There goes the dreams we used to say
(Oops!) There goes the time we spent away
(Oops!) There goes the love I had
But you cheated on me and that's for that now
(Oops!) There goes the house we've made a home
(Oops!) There goes ""you'll never leave me alone""
(Oops!) For all the lies you told
This is what you owe

[Chorus]
Hey ladies (Hey ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh (Oh), when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
Hey ladies (Ladies), when ya man wanna get buck wild (Oh)
Just go back and hit 'em up style
Get your hands on his cash and
Spend it to the last dime for all the hard times
Oh, when you go, then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If you mess up, you gotta hit 'em up
[Bridge]
All of the dreams you sold
Left me out in the cold
What happened to the days when we used to trust each other?
And all of the things I sold
Will take you until you get old
To get 'em back without me
'Cause revenge is just better than money, you'll see

[Chorus]
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Hit 'em up style)
Get your hands on his cash and (Oh yeah)
Oh, when you go then everything goes
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Oh-oh-oh)
Hey ladies (Hey ladies, hey ladies, hey ladies, yeah)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh no, oh no, yeah, oh oh oh
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up (Hit 'em up, yeah)
Hey ladies, when ya man wanna get buck wild (Buck wild)
Just go back and hit 'em up style (Oh)
Get your hands on his cash and (Da da dum, da da dum)
Oh, when you go then everything goes (Everything goes)
From the crib to the ride and the clothes
So you better let 'em know that
If he mess up, you gotta hit 'em up"

Better move, 'cause we've arrived

You gotta do much better

Buckle your seatbelt, it's time for takeoff

166,2001,Brad Paisley,Two People Fell In Love,"[Verse 1]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon
Before you know it he's off to school and then he graduates in May
Goes out and gets a Ph.D. and then cures all sorts of things
Wins a Nobel Prize and saves a million different lives
The world's a better place for all he's done
It's funny when you think about the reason he's alive
It's all because two people fell in love

Right now at a picnic shelter down by Caney Creek
You'll find potato salad hot dogs and baked beans
The whole Wilson family's lined up filling their paper plates
They've driven or flown in here from fifteen different states
Well Stanley Wilson says that sixty years ago he knew
That Miss Emma Tucker was the one
Now five generations get together every June
All because two people fell in love

[Chorus]
There is nothing not affected
When two hearts get connected
All that is, will be, or ever was
Every single choice we make
Every breath we get to take
Is all because two people fell in love
[Verse 2]
Well, I recall a young man who was drifting aimlessly
And a young waitress who seemed lonesome as could be
But in a little cafe right off of fourteenth avenue
With a whole lot to help from up above
We met and things sure turned around for me and you
And all because two people fell in love

[Chorus]

[Tag]
You know, to me it's all so clear
Every one of us is here
All because two people fell in love

[Outro]
A baby's born in the middle of the night in a local delivery room
They grab his feet, smack him till he cries he goes home the next afternoon"

Look at us baby, look at us now
For every day that I should have you by my side
We'll make it baby, look at us now

For every night I pray I know that you will stay
Look at us baby, look at us now
Remembering the time our love was not so fine
We made it baby, look at us now, baby look at us

Everybody believed we would never be
Look at us up above, we are so in love
Everyday in your arms, baby, can't go wrong
We are strong, look at us now

A bird up in the sky, our love will not deny
We'll make it baby, look at us now

In all you ever do, I know you will be true
Look at us baby, look at us now
The story of our kind is one to never die
We'll make it baby, look at us now
Baby look at us"
168,2001,Craig David,Fill Me In,"[Intro]
I got something to say, something to say
Alright (Can you feel me?)
Come on
Can you fill me in?
What you want? What you want me to do, baby?
Can you fill me in?
Let's talk about it

[Verse 1]
I was checkin' this girl next door when her parents went out
She phoned, said, ""Hey boy, come on right around""
So I knock at the door
You was standin' with a bottle of red wine, ready to pour
Dressed in long black satin and lace to the floor
So I went in, then we sat down, start kissing, caressing
Told me about Jacuzzi, sounded interesting
So we jumped right in
All calls diverted to answer phone
Please leave a message after the tone
I mean, me and her parents were kind of cool
But they were the fine line between me and you
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in?""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (It's another one, it's another one)
[Verse 2]
Whenever the coast was clear and she'd ask me to come out
I'd say, ""Hey girl, come on right around""
So she knocked at the door
I was standing with the keys in my hand to the four by four
Jumped in my ride, checkin' that nobody saw
The club we went in
We got down bounced- bounced to the rhythm
Saw it was early morning
Thought we'd better be leavin'
So I gave you my jacket for you to hold
Told you to wear it 'cause you felt cold
I mean, me and her didn't mean to break the rules
I weren't trying to play your mum and dad for fools
We were just doing things young people in love do
Parents tryna find out what we were up to

[Chorus]
Saying, ""Why can't you keep your promises no more?
Say you'll be home by twelve, come strolling in at four?
Out with the girls, but leaving with the boy next door""
Can you fill me in? (Fill me in)
Wearing a jacket, who's property
Said you'd been queuing for a taxi
But you left all your money on the TV (Can you tell me?)
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)
[Bridge]
All they seem to do is be checking up on you, baby
Watchin' our every move
Think some day they might approve, baby

[Chorus]
""Why were you creeping 'round late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you're dressed in black
When I left, you were dressed in white
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)""
Calls diverted to answer phone
Red wine bottle, half the contents gone
Midnight return, Jacuzzi turned on
Can you fill me in? (Can you fill me in?)"
169,2001,2Pac,Until The End Of Time,"[Produced By: Johnny J & Trackmasters]

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

[Hook: R.L. Huggar]
So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time"
170,2001,Mark McGuinn,Mrs. Steven Rudy,"I get up on Sunday, about eight-fifteen
Just to get the paper that I never read
'Cause I know she'll be there barely in her robe
Sittin' on her front porch paintin' on her toes
Her husband's always on the road

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Sometimes Mrs. Rudy calls cryin' late at night
'Cause her and Mr. Ugly have had another fight
We talk a while, and I hear her smile
When she says thank you, I tell her that she's welcome
Like any friend would do
I only wish she knew

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you
Imagination, infatuation
I'm what she deserves
I wonder if she thinks about me
The way I think about her

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you
Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You're the neighborhood beauty
And that wedding ring is as ugly as your husband is to you

Hey, Mrs. Steven Rudy
You don't know what you do to me
Every night I dream one day of being with you

That wedding ring is as ugly to me
As your husband is to you

Did you sleep on the wrong side, I'm catching a bad vibe
And it's contagious, what's the latest?
Speak your heart, don't bite your tongue
Don't get it twisted (Yeah), don't misuse it
What's your problem, let's resolve it
We can solve it, what's the causes?
It's official, you got issues
I got issues (Um, well you got issues), but I know I miss you

Who should be hurt, will we remain? Oh, I
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion
[Verse 2: Aaliyah]
I wanna know, where were you last night?
I fell asleep on the couch, I thought we were going out
I wanna know, were your fingers broke?
If you had let me know I wouldn't have put on my clothes
(I wanna know) Where'd you go instead?
It was four in the morning when you crept back in the bed
I wanna know, what was in your head?
Or what was in my head, am I supposed to change?

[Chorus: Aaliyah]
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Oh, who should be hurt, who should be blamed?
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Who should be hurt, who should be ashamed?
(Am I supposed to change, are you supposed to change?)
Oh, who should be hurt and will we remain?
We need a resolution, we need a resolution
We need a resolution, we have so much confusion

Who should be hurt and who should be blamed?

You'll let me know, you'll let me know

Girl, holla
You give me bits and pieces
You tryna blame me when I don't even know the reason
I think it's just the season
Maybe the month, maybe you're bleeding
Now tell me what's the reason?
Snoop video? Looks are deceiving
So, cut the crying, cut the coughing, cut the wheezing, girl
Quit the blaming, cut the naming, cut the sneaking, girl
I think you need some prayer, better call a deacon, girl
So get your act right or else we won't be speaking, girl
So what's it gonna be?
Freaky-freaky, me and you?
Or is it gonna be, who blames who?
I'm tired of these things, I'm tired of these scars
I think I'm gonna get me a drink, I'll call you tomorrow, ooh"
172,2001,Jessica Andrews,Who I Am,"If I live to be a hundred
And never see the seven wonders
That'll be alright
If I don't make it to the big leagues
If I never win a Grammy
I'm gonna be just fine
Cause I know exactly who I am

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

So when I make a big mistake
And when I fall flat on my face
I know I'll be alright
Should my tender heart be broken
I will cry those teardrops knowing
I will be just fine
Cause nothing changes who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am

I'm a saint
And I'm a sinner
I'm a loser
I'm a winner
I am steady and unstable
I'm young
But I am able

I am Rosemary's granddaughter
The spitting image of my father
And when the day is done
My momma's still my biggest fan

Sometimes I'm clueless and I'm clumsy
But I've got friends that love me
And they know just where I stand
It's all a part of me
And that's who I am
I am Rosemary's granddaughter

175,2001,Faith Evans Featuring Carl Thomas,Can't Believe,"[Verse 1]
[Carl Thomas]
I always dreamed that everything would be okay
With me and you, but I was wrong
When I looked into your eyes, I didn't see all the things
I used to see, what's going on?

[Faith Evans]
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases, no more, no more
(Never imagined...)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (so emotional)

[Verse 2: Faith Evans]
I can't forget that night I saw you in the corner
Wrapped up tight, you were warm
Slow dancing on the floor while I was watching
From the door so hurt, there you were
You gave me reasons to believe
That we were always meant to be
But now I see, you were wrong
You can't keep running back to me
With all those baby, baby pleases no more, no more
[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be
A faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional

[Bridge: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
You had your chance (had your chance)
But you threw it all away (yes, you did)
Thought you had my love always
Oh baby, I don't understand
How you think that we could stay
In total unhappiness (unhappiness)

[Chorus: Faith Evans & Carl Thomas]
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (I'm emotional)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
(no more baby, baby, please)
I'm emotional (you threw it all away)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official)
Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
(just a faded picture, faded picture) (gotta leave you, baby)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (baby, could you hear me, oh)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official
I'm emotional (it's official, I'm emotional)

Never imagined you would be a faded picture
I'm emotional (never imagined, oh)
It's so believing, your deceiving, it's official

Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows, I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)

Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?
My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now don't be offended, this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself (Go on and love yourself, go on and love yourself)
‘Cause everything's gonna be alright

Uh, keep your fancy drinks, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All I need is my guitar
Keep your Cristal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own
What God gave me is just fine (Oh)

You cannot quit me so quickly
There's no hope in you, for me
No corner you could squeeze me?
But I got all the time for you, love

[Hook]
The space between
The tears we cry
Is the laughter - keeps us coming back for more
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain

[Verse 2]
But will I hold you again?
These fickle, fuddled words confuse me
Like 'Will it rain today?'
Waste the hours with talking, talking
These twisted games we're playing

[Hook 2]
We're strange allies
With warring hearts
What a wild-eyed beast you be
The space between
The wicked lies we tell
In hope to keep safe from the pain
[Breakdown]
Will I hold you again?
Will I hold...
Look at us spinning out in
The madness of a roller coaster
You know you went off like
A devil in a church
In the middle of a crowded room
All we can do, my love
Is hope we don't take this ship down

[Hook 3]
The space between
Where you smile and hide
Is where you'll find me if I get to go
The space between
The bullets in our firefight
Is where I'll be hiding, waiting for you
The rain that falls
Splashed in your heart
Ran like sadness down the window into your room
The space between
Our wicked lies
Is where we hope to keep safe from pain
Take my hand
Cause we're walking out of here
Oh, right out of here
Is all we need dear
The space between
What's wrong and right
Is where you'll find me hiding, waiting for you
The space between
Your heart and mind
Is a space we'll fill with time
The space between
The tears we cry is the laughter keeps us coming back for more
The space between
Our wicked lies where we hope to keep safe from pain
The space between

Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes?
Why do I see you when a stranger passes by?
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind
I feel you when the sun is dancin' on my skin
And when it's raining
You won't find me complaining 'cause

[Chorus:]
When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels
I think about you

[Verse 2:]
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss
I like the way that they both linger on my lips
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside
Beautiful distraction
You make every thought a chain reaction

When I think about rain
I think about singing
When I think about singing
It's a heavenly tune
When I think about heaven
Then I think about angels
When I think about angels

Anywhere I go, anything I do
Everything around me, baby
Makes me think of you

Ay ay Snoop whattup, this your nigga Dre
Ay man I was thinking I ain't said shit on your whole motherfucking album
So check it out, put this on there:
All you motherfucking haters out there, can suck my motherfucking dick!
And we still smoking, what?!

For the nigga who be talking loud and holding his dick, talking shit
He better lay low
For the bitch that said I shot some shit up out of my dick, now she sick
She better lay low
For the niggas who be claiming my hood
And really ain't from my gang, better lay low
I hope he don't be thinking I'm just talking
And I won't do a thing, really hope so

[Snoop Dogg]
Lay low, nobody move until I say so
Limo tint rolling deep like the President
See I don't go to clubs, I never chase a bitch
I'm here to bang that gangsta shit to the apocalypse
We call it stress, some of y'all call it chocolate
Return of the Top Dogg, and ain't no stopping this
Whatever the case, I ain't trying to catch it
Lay low, blow big dope, and slang records
Unseen but well heard, do not disturb
The only reason you alive cause I ain't sent the word
I flip, faster than birds, Snoop Dogg will emerge
From the smoke and go loc, you shouldn't provoke

Smash motherfuckers thinking they gonna smash on me
Snoop and Dre give a fuck about what y'all say
From the World's Most Dangerous Group, N.W.A

Our rise, it was no surprise
I always knew these fools would trip
Hating, faking, scheming on mine
And on the down low talkin shit
Best move cause I refuse to lose
No matter which damn road I choose
So lay low cause you might be bruised
Top story on the evening news
I ain't for games, so if you wanna play 'em lay low
Lay down on the floor
I'm in a rage, so if we gotta do this let me know
That's what I came fo'

[Goldie Loc]
Where that nigga who be talking shit
He don't come around no more because I fucked his bitch
I made her suck my dick, while I was squeezing the tits
Then I hit it from the back, gripped tight on them hips
She tried to make me cum, but I was trying to take her home
Dropped her off and seen you fishing on your raggedy Brougham
Coulda thumped you in your dome (you little fag)
And don't sag too hard, you show everybody your thong

[Tray Deee]
Booyaka booyaka, we bring it straight to ya
From 22's to Luger's the shit that shoot through ya
Who you motherfuckers think the Top Dogg bang with
The same clique he came with and made the game flip
Now niggas grow they hair, hold they stare and act hard
That's even tho' your CEO talk shit get slapped hard
The backyard is where we get our scrap on
The black car drive by then you get capped on

Whassup pimping, it's P and Snoop
With Dre on the beat, this ain't nothing but loot
They call me Jed Clampett for all the bread I got

It's something about her you know that
The way she cares of herself, she's just so bad

To nothing on this earth
She's not the kind to share
Only God know what she's worth

Can you feel a little love?

[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
As your boney fingers close around me
Long and spindly, death becomes me
Heaven, can you see what I see?
Hey, you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're given, mmh

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without, it lives within you

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching
[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Can you feel a little love?
Can you feel a little love?
Dream on, dream on

[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it's well-rehearsed
It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you

What a king's supposed to be; baby, I feel free
Come on and go with me

Elevation, maybe we can talk about Surah 31:18

Your background, it ain't squeaky clean, shit
Sometimes we all got to swim upstream
You ain't no saint, we all a sinner
But you put your good foot down and make your soul the winner

Then you're humble; man, I'm numb with your feeling
I can feel everything that you bring

Or maybe eat some passion fruit
Or maybe cry to the blues
Or maybe we could just be silent

193,2001,Blake Shelton,Austin,"[Verse 1]
She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then
[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you"

That's when everybody stopped dancing
And I couldn't stop myself staring
Yeah I couldn't breathe, no I couldn't believe my eyes

Five inch heals, watch how I move
Watch how I shake it to the beat, how I do

It took me by surprise
When I saw you standin' there
Close enough to touch
Breathin' the same air
You asked me how I'd been
I guess that's when I smiled and said just fine
Oh, but baby I was lyin'

What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

And as you walked away
The echo of my words
Cut just like a knife
Cut so deep it hurt
I held back the tears
Held on to my pride and watched you go
I wonder if you'll ever know
What I really meant to say
Is I'm dyin' here inside
And I miss you more each day
There's not a night I haven't cried
And baby, here's the truth
I'm still in love with you
(And, that's what I really meant to say)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm really not that strong
No matter how I try
I'm still holdin' on
And here's the honest truth
I'm still in love with you
And, that's what I really meant to say

That's what I really meant to say

Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
Nothing's quite the same now I just say your name now

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had
So you stole my world now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl leaves me down and lonely
Send it in a letter, make yourself feel better

But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't need me back
You're just the best I ever had

And it may take some time to patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I run away and hide
And I may find in time that you were always right
You're always right

So you sailed away into a grey sky morning
Now I'm here to stay, love can be so boring
What was it you wanted? Could it be I'm haunted?
But it's not so bad
You're only the best I ever had

There you again, bein' worse, um yeah

I'm not doing this shit for nothing
I pay the car note, light bill, house note
What you think, this shit's for nothing?
You're not workin'
So what more you want?

You got two seconds, pack your shit and get on outta here
Gotta go, gotta go baby
You don't appreciate what a man like me is about
No you don't
And you know I'm workin' 9 to 5
Workin' hard everyday baby (listen)
Even put my name (put my name)
Even served my day (served my day)
Down for some overtime, yeah

See there you go (there you go, there you go)
Tryin' to run the show
Oh, you don't pay my car note
Pay my light bill
Pay my house note

I'm not doing this shit for nothing
I pay the car note, light bill, house note
What you think, this shit's for nothing?
You're not workin'
So what more you want?

See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you

Baby, I don't know why you're treating me so bad
(Treat me so bad)
You said you love me, no one above me and I was all you had

And though my heart is beating for you, I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way and still I stay

[Bridge]
See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak 'cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same
That you ain't never gonna change
(Never gonna change, never gonna change)

See, my days are cold without you (My days are cold, baby)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)

See, my days are cold without you (Without you)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more (No more, no more)
I keep on running back to you

Baby, why you hurt me, leave me and desert me?
Boy, I gave you all my heart and all you did was tear it up
Looking out my window, knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags, this something always holds me back"

Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks (*record scratch*)

[Refrain 1: Eminem]
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside

[Refrain 2: Eminem]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie!
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass (*smack*)​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

[Verse 3: Eminem]
A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
[Chorus: Eminem]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

You off the planet, wherever you at you stand out
Plus you specialize in freakin your man out
Put it all in one pot lets see if it pan out
Stick ya hand out, I got it all planned out
Layin out the way, I set a date to wed on
Plus you got your head on, you my queen from here on
Lookin like lady Revlon with all red on
She fiending till I'm in her arms, I'm King
Put the silk bedspread on
Rose pedals and scent candle lit
Victoria's Secret set on
Rough sex turnin her on
So ghetto, innocent but scandalous just bling and fur on
Million dollar habit, she said its a fetish she gotta have it
Once she get it, she holla thats it
Keep the waters rapid
The hotter its automatic

Oh shit, she OD'n again I got an addict

[Verse 2: Truth Hurts]
He breaks me down, he builds me up
He fills my cup, I like it rough
We fuss, we brawl, we rise, we fall
He comes in late, but it's okay
He do, I do, he knows the rules
He takes care of home, though he's not alone
I'm on his team, he keeps me clean
And gives me things, he makes me scream
[Hook: Truth Hurts]
He's so contagious, returns my pages
He's got me anxious, he's what I've waited for
He keeps me guessing, spontaneous
He's so persuasive and I'm his lady

Oh! Tonight is waitin, and I ain't complainin
I'm entertainin, my number one fan
My back is achin, from our love makin
Oh yes I'm taken, ain't no use in fakin

He hits the spot, he makes me hot
I'm all that he's got, and he's all that I've got

Thinking of a master plan
You know anything you need baby ask your man
You was there from a half a gram
Now it's kilos to C-notes and high fashion brands
We ball like we own the world
The only concern is you my only girl
And when we speakin in tongues
Breathing hard when I'm squeezin' your lungs
Keep it strong, but I gotta hit the streets when I'm done
It's joy and pain, when you tryin to get ahead of the game
It's fucked up, but you never complain
You just pray I don't get killed when I hit the hood
Just another hundred mill' and I'mma quit for good
No more drug wars trips to jail and shootouts
Gettin loot out for lawyers and bail'll get you boot out
Just me and you, high off sex and twisted

210,2002,Puddle Of Mudd,Blurry,"[Verse 1]
Everything's so blurry and everyone's so fake
And everybody's empty and everything is so messed up
Preoccupied, without you I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl

[Verse 2]
You could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I'll protect you from all of the obscene
I wonder what you're doing, imagine where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face?

[Verse 3]
Everyone is changing, there's no one left that's real
So make up your own ending and let me know just how you feel
Cause I am lost without you, I cannot live at all
My whole world surrounds you, I stumble then I crawl
[Verse 4]
And you could be my someone, you could be my scene
You know that I will save you from all of the unclean
I wonder what you're doing, I wonder where you are
There's oceans in between us, but that's not very far

[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me

[Bridge]
No-nobody told me what you thought
Nobody told me what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Told you when to run away
Nobody told you where to hide
Nobody told you what to say
Everyone showed you where to turn
Showed you when to run away
[Chorus]
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
Can you take it all away?
Can you take it all away?
When you shoved it in my face
This pain you gave to me
No, this pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me?

[Outro]
Can you take it all?
Can you take it all away?
The pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me
This pain you gave to me
Take it all away
This pain you gave to me..."

When did our light turn from green to red?

Lost the will to do this once again

Teachers dated me, my parents hated me

Every day I fight a war against the mirror
I can't take the person staring back at me

Oh yes
(Uh, this for you, girl)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from ""Casino"" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you?
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (I'ma be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you?
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it (Ooh)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright (Be alright)
I said I couldn't do it but I did it (Yes, I did it)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it (Oh, yes)
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez & Nas]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be okay (I need to be okay)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be living without you (Living without you, shit 'cause life is crazy)
So now it's time for me to make that move (Uh, check it)

[Verse 4: Nas & (Jennifer Lopz)]
Yo, nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin (Oh, no)
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright (Be alright, yes)
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right? (Oh, no)
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature?
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat (Said I'm gonna be alright)
I'm slow caught

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright
I said I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright"

[Verse 1]
Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused 'cause for you, I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothing's the same
And really I just want my friend back

[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I'd hate to walk away from you as if this never existed
'Cause when we kissed, the moment after, I looked at you different, yeah
Lately, I gotta watch what I say
'Cause you take things personal nowadays
You used to laugh, now you get mad
Damn, I just want my friend back
[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Holdin' on)

And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Oh oh oh, oh oh, yeah
What happened to the one I used to know? (Oh, yeah, yeah)
The one I used to laugh and joke with?
The one I used to tell all my secrets?
We used to chill and be down for whatever, whenever together, yeah

[Chorus]
And my mind's gone half crazy (Oh) 'cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy, baby)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me (Oh) holdin' on (Over you, yeah)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (Yeah) 'cause I can't leave you alone (And I just don't know)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (I said I just don't know what to do now)
(Listen, we used to chill)
And my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, we used to hang)
And I'm wonderin' if it's worth me holdin' on (Yeah, we used to do, we used to do some many things together, yeah)
Said my mind's gone half crazy 'cause I can't leave you alone (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You're a song
Written by the hands of God
Don't get me wrong
'Cause this might sound to you a bit odd
But you own the place
Where all my thoughts go hiding
And right under your clothes
Is where I find them

[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey

[Verse 2]
'Cause of you
I forgot the smart ways to lie
Because of you
I'm running out of reasons to cry
When the friends are gone
When the party's over
We will still belong to each other
[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I love you more than all that's on the planet
Movin', talkin', walkin', breathin'
You know it's true
Oh, baby, it's so funny
You almost don't believe it
As every voice is hanging from the silence
Lamps are hanging from the ceiling
Like a lady tied to her manners
I'm tied up to this feeling
[Chorus]
Underneath your clothes
There's an endless story
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl, honey
Underneath your clothes
Whoa-oh-oh
There's the man I chose
There's my territory
And all the things I deserve
For being such a good girl
For being such a good girl"

So lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love
To light the shadows on your face

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone
Could you make it on your own?

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Verse 2]
And maybe I'll find out
A way to make it back someday
To watch you, to guide you
Through the darkest of your days

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If a great wave shall fall
And fall upon us all
Then, I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you
[Chorus]
If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

[Bridge]
Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind
I'll stay with you for all of time

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low
I'll go wherever you will go

If I could turn back time
I'll go wherever you will go
If I could make you mine

(It starts with one) One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal (It's so unreal)
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Rememberin' all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far

Turn around and sit it down and let 'em bite your butt
See the steerin' wheel is Fendi, dashboard Armani

Cruisin' through the parkin' lot on twenty-fours
Cadillac Escalade with the chromed-out nose
With an navigation arrow headed straight to your spot (Turn left)
Where your wife really love me cause the sex is so hot
Put the Caddy up, start the 3-wheel Benz (Skrtt)
Hyper white lights, ultra-violet lens
Sumitomo tires and they gotta be run flat
TV where the horn go, (Uh uh) boy can you top that
I'ma show you some shit, rookie, press that button
The trunk went ""uh-uh"", and all of a sudden
Four 15's, didn't see no wires
And then I heard (Boom) from the amplifiers

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay sharp, (Ho-ho-hood rich) I stay shive

Got a quarter tank of gas in my new E class

Let me slide in the Benz with the fished out fins
Impala loud pipes, drinkin' the Henn'
It's the Birdie-Birdie Man, I'll do it again
In a Cadillac truck twenty-fours with tens
Lookin' at my Gucci, it's about that time
Six bad broads flyin' in at nine
New Suburban truck with the porno showin'
Up and down and up they goin'
Bodies on the Roadster, Lexus, you know what
That hard-top Bimmer, yo Ma, that's your truck
I'm comin' up, the hood been lovely
New shoes on the whip and I wake up to bubbly
430 Lex with the convertible top
And the rims keeps spinning every time I stop
Got a Superman Benz that I scored from Shaq
With a old school Caddy with a diamond in the back

Gator boots with the pimped out Gucci suits
Ain't got no job, but I stay shive, I stay shive
Can't pay my rent cause all my money's spent

It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from the bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, 'til the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
And I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way an old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake 'cross the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My Uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking
A couple of burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we'd haul off a load
Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero that just received his medal
[Chorus]
It was just an old hand me down Ford
With three speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young boy, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I'd keep it right
He'd say ""A little slower son, you're doing just fine""
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
I'm grown up now, three daughters of my own
I let them drive my old Jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile and say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out Jeep
With rusty old floorboards, hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say ""Turn it left"" and ""Steer it right""
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
When Daddy let me drive
Oh he let me drive

It was just an old plywood boat
With a '75 Johnson and electric choke"

Had a nice little life
A little boat a little beach
A little routine I liked
A blue ocean view
Free to go with the flow
Anywhere that I wanted to
But the moment you set foot on my shore
That's when I knew

[Chorus]
There's a difference in living and living well
You can't have it all all by yourself
Something's always missing
Till you share it with someone else
There's a difference in living and living well

[Verse 2]
Till you sailed with me
Thought that I had it good
As good as it could be
From the back of my deck
Caught a fish caught a breeze
And a thousand red sunsets
But sitting here with you girl I just saw
The best one yet

[Bridge]
My days are brighter
My sky a deeper blue
My nights are sweeter
When I'm with you

Waiting in the driveway
Shining like a bright new star
I've been wishing on it every day
To take me away from here

So I called in to where I work
Told a little white lie
No, my back don't really hurt
But that's my alibi
My temporary ticket to anywhere but there

Call it an early weekend
Call it going off the deep end
Call it what you want
I made up my mind

I don't have to be me 'til Monday

Three days without punching a time clock
Three nights of goin' non-stop
No work and all play
I don't have to be me 'til Monday

I can do what I wanna do
Be who I wanna be
I got no one to answer to
Soon as I turn the key
A cash machine, gasoline, and we're outta here

Call it going off the deep end
Baby, you and me
We can leave it all behind

I never knew there were such great movies
On tv at 3 am
I'd never guessed that at midnight tuesday
I could have pizza ordered in
I've never been a real night owl
But these days i'm all turned around
There's only one thing i'm sure of right now

[Chorus:]
I should be sleeping
'stead of keeping
These late hours i've been keeping
I've been pacing and retracing
Every step of every move
Even though i'm feeling so right
I'm so happy still i know i
Should be sleeping
Instead of dreaming about you

[Verse 2:]
I never knew that i was funny
'til i went and made you laugh
Never liked a girl to call me honey
But you did and i liked that
I keep thinking about your smile
Trying to read between the lines
Looks like i'll be up for a while
[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
After just three dates
And one great kiss
It's way too soon
To be obsessing like this

[Chorus]

Dreaming about you
I should be sleeping
Dreaming about you
Well, i'm dreaming about you
Yeah"

Fathers hands were lined with dirt
From long days in the field
And mothers hands are serving meals
In a café on Main Street
With mouths to feed
Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
And all I hear about
Is how it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
Let's walk, let's talk

You left without saying goodbye
Although I'm sure you tried
You call the house from time to time
To make sure we're alive
But you weren't there
Right when I needed you the most
And now I dream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

Father's hands are lined with guilt
For tearing us apart
Guess it turned out in the end
Just look at where we are
We made it out
We still got clothing on our backs
And now I scream about it
And how it's so bad, it's so bad

It's too bad, it's stupid
Too late, so wrong, so long
It's too bad that we had no time to rewind

Under an old brass paperweight
Is my list of things to do today
Go to the bank and the hardware store
Put a new lock on the cellar door
I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set
There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet

[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Verse 2]
Wouldn't change the course of fate
But cutting the grass just had to wait
Cause I've got more important things
Like pushing' my kid on the backyard swing
I won't break my back for a million bucks
I can't take to my grave
So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today like
[Chorus]
Go for a walk, say a little prayer
Take a deep breath of mountain air
Put on my glove and play some catch
It's time that I make time for that
Wade the shore and cast a line
Look up a long lost friend of mine
Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss
Start living, that's the next thing on my list

[Chorus 2]
Raise a little hell, laugh 'till it hurts
Put an extra five in the plate at church
Call up my folks just to chat
It's time that I make time for that
Stay up late, then oversleep
Show her what she means to me
Catch up on all the things I've always missed
Just start living', that's the next thing on my list

[Intro]
One time, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop, glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back—fuck gettin' hit!
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with 9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)
All I need is one mic (yeah)

[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me—fuck all of them!
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's 16 apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holdin' 17
27 hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up, shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, too many 9s
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way: they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now!
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (that's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (there's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know)
All I need is one mic (this is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you only if they know what your weakness is
I have none, too late to grab guns
I'm blastin' ‘cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed
Body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace
Lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon ‘cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I need is one mic (all I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)
All I need is one mic (fuck the cars, the jewelry)
All I need is one mic (to spread my voice to the whole world, baby)"
245,2002,Tommy Shane Steiner,What If She's An Angel,"There's a man standing on the corner
With a sign saying, 'Will work for food'
You know the man, you see him every morning
The one you never give your money to

You can sit there with your window rolled up
Wondering when the lights going to turn green
Never knowing what a couple more bucks
In his pocket might mean

What if he's an angel sent here from Heaven
And he's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in his face
Knowing deep down it could have been his saving grace
What if he's an angel?

There's a man and there's a woman
Living right above you in apartment G
There's a lot of noise coming through the ceiling
And it don't sound like harmony

You can sit there with your TV turned up
While the words and his anger fly
But come tomorrow when you see her with her shades on
Can you look her in the eye?
What if she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
But what if she's an angel?

A little girl on daddy's lap
Hiding her disease with a baseball cap
You can turn the channel, most people do
But what if you were sitting in her daddy's shoes?

Maybe she's an angel sent here from Heaven
And she's making certain that you're doing your best
To take the time to help one another
Brother are you going to pass that test?

You can go on with your day to day
Trying to forget what you saw in her face
Knowing deep down it could have been her saving grace
What if she's an angel?"

A new day has come

[Verse 1]
I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush, now
I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears (Drown my fears)
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has come

Time will bring us near
I'll never be too far
Oh, baby, don't you fear
I'll always be right where you are

You can dry my tears
But you can't stop the pain inside
I'm trying to hide
As I hold you near
I know I have to pull away
You know that I can't stay

All of my life
No one has touched me the way that you do
Wherever I go
I know that the road will lead back to you

248,2002,Lonestar,Not A Day Goes By,"[Verse 1]
Got a picture of you I carry in my heart
Close my eyes to see it when the world gets dark
Got a memory of you I carry in my soul
I wrap it close around me when the nights get cold
If you asked me how I'm doin' I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

[Verse 2]
I still wait for the phone in the middle of the night
Thinkin' you might call me if your dreams don't turn out right
And it still amazes me that I lie here in the dark
Wishin' you were next to me, with your head against my heart
If you asked me how I'm doing I'd say just fine
But the truth is baby, if you could read my mind

[Chorus]
Not a day goes by that I don't think of you
After all this time you're still with me it's true
Somehow you remain locked so deep inside
Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

Minutes turn to hours, and the hours to days
Seems it's been forever that I've felt this way

Not a day goes by that I don't think of you

Baby, baby, oh baby, not a day goes by

Sometimes, some people get me wrong
When it's something I've said or done
Sometimes, you feel there is no fun
That's why you turn and run

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I truly realize
Some people don't wanna compromise
Well, I saw them with my own eyes
Spreading those lies
And, well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day
I'm walking away from the troubles in my life
I'm walking away, oh, to find a better day

Well, I'm so tired, baby
Things you say, you're driving me away
Whispers in the powder room, baby
Don't listen to the games they play

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, I thought you'd realize
I'm not like them other guys
'Cause I saw them with my own eyes
You should've been more wise, babe
And well, I don't wanna live a lie
Too many sleepless nights
Not mentioning the fights
I'm sorry to say, lady

No rush though I need your touch
I won't rush your heart

Until your strength is found, girl

And I'll walk a step behind
In the shadows so you shine
Just ask it will be done

He treated you unkind
And broken wings need time to heal
Before a heart can fly, girl

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers

While in their memories, tiny tragedies

I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

Should I wild out? (WHAT THE FUCK?!)
Act like my rims ain't clean
How you gonna act like my neck don't bling?
Haters get sprayed like Afro-Sheen
But they don't ever really wanna pop them thangs
Cane, cane sugar man, Luda don't go
And I stop at a light, pulled up so slow
But I'm out for the night, so pass that 'dro
So daddy come home in a Cadillac brome (Cadillac brome?)

How you gonna act like I don't get loud?
How you gonna act like I don't rock crowds?
And leave a lot of people with a gap tooth smile
If I recollect right then you sound like dirt
But I guess what you don't really know don't hurt
With a vest and a pump, hear the shotgun squirt
My folks on the block, man, they got that work (They got that work?)
Don't it smell so good?

Protect your chest, they up to no good

How you gonna act like I just ain't strapped?
How you gon' act like I don't push 'Lacs?

Itchy finger trigger, man, Luda don't squeeze
With a mac, with a Glock, I'mma make 'em say please
In the back, on block so the cops say ""freeze""
And I'm so high, I think I got a nose bleed (You got a nose bleed?)

258,2002,Tweet,Oops (Oh My),"[Verse 1: Tweet]
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high, hypnotized
In a trance
From his body, so buttery brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook, I had to catch my breath

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 2: Tweet]
I tried and I tried to avoid
But this thing was happening
Swallowed my pride
Let it ride and partied
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left; reflection of myself
That's why I couldn't catch my breath
[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, some kinda touch caressing my legs
Oh my (Oh my)
Ooh, I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Bridge: Missy Elliott & (Tweet)]
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was looking so good, I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was feeling so good, I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, I was eyeing my thighs, butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Mmm, comin' outta my shirt and then my skirt came down

[Chorus: Tweet]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my (Oh my)
Oops, there goes my skirt droppin' to my feet

And tell you everything you're going through
Baby I've tried to find, i've the reasons why
You're alone and acting so cold

Tell me how long you've been this way
Maybe I can open up your heart
See, I've been waiting all my life
For someone just like you
And I know you've been waiting too
For someone to love you

CHORUS
All you need is someone who cares (Someone to love you)
Someone who will always be there
All you need to say is that
You want me to be with you
Girl I know you waited so long
For someone to love you

Baby I wish I could be there
For every time you ever shed a tear
Baby I hate to see a pretty girl like you
Going through, the things that you do

Girl I think you've gone for far too long
Without a good man to make you smile
How can I appeal to you and make you understand
That I'm here when you're ready for
Someone to love you
CHORUS

Baby you've been waiting for the man from all the fairy tales
Or maybe just the man from all your dreams
Try to think reality, Lets talk possibilities
Cause girl you know you've waited for so long
For someone to love you

All you need is someone...

Maybe it was the moonlight
The scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger
Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert into my soul

[Chorus]
Mi corazón perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh, my heart is lost to you

[Verse 2]
Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment that hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by your gaze
There was some kind of magic led me away

[Chorus]
Mi corazón perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh, my heart is lost to you

263,2002,Kellie Coffey,When You Lie Next To Me,"Oh

Maybe tonight
We could close the door and lock ourselves inside
Take time to feel
I don't want to miss the chance to be so real
The days all fly away and I forget the truth
Everything that matters, is, in this room

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

My heart is yours
And every part of me still wants to give you more
More time to love
'Cos you never know when life will leave us
I want to take in all the beauty here
Oh, let the world around us just disappear

When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me
Oh lie next to me
When you lie next to me
Breathing the air I breathe
We don't have to speak, an' just be
Our love's a precious thing
Don't want to waste a day
Or one more minute without you in it
Life is so sweet
When you lie next to me

When you lie next to me"

Ah, y'all done up and done it

[Verse 1: Fish Scales]
My first song was like forty-eight bars with no hook
You hear me flippin' thru my pages out my favorite notebook
The microphone was in the closet (What?) No headphones, we lost it
Niggas scared to get some water, roaches hangin' over the faucets
No AC, Tez'll break a sweat just tryin to make beats
E-Dubz was being a hustler, (Hey man!)
Always flirtin' with all his customers, and flat broke
Nappy smokin' blacks out on the back po'ch
I'm thinkin' I got everything a country boy could ask for

[Verse 2: Big V]
Now what we do to get here? (Say dat boy!!)
Lay it down and bring it to ya raw (Say dat boy!!)
Hey now we hurt some, suffered for more, takes what we work for
Hated for for the cussin', but the hatred it made us cuss more
Held on, but it was hard - stepped up, took charge
Ran through what we scared of, but what was we afraid for?
Look at what we made of, hard times done made us
Being here is alright, but must believe we want more!

Skullied on that front po'ch, plus you know they got 'dro
Seventy-nine coupe DeVille vertical Caddy grill
Interstate 65 headin' down to Cashville
Glass filled, to the tippy-top, back-seat Benz
Spent my last cent on the rent, left with pocket lints
A damn shame, gotta grind anythang and everythang
Jimmy Crack Corn, cross the county line with Mary Jane
A long time, a gravel road, to cash and fame and sold my soul
To Hell and back, and back and forth, with same jeans and nappy 'fro

Unwanted live my life a shame

267,2002,Joe,What If A Woman,"[Verse 1]
What if a woman
Had a man on the side
And she never spent time with you
What if a woman
Said she's working late
And it's always the same excuse
What if a woman
Took the keys to your whip
Said I'll be right back, don't trip
What if a woman
Left you home with the kids
Changing diapers and shit
What a twist

[Chorus]
Could you stand inside her shoes and walk a mile?
(I don't really think so)
Could you hold her down when she doesn't smile?
(I don't know a man who could)
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like us?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?
[Verse 2]
What if a woman
Started wearing the pants
Would you feel less of a man and more
What if a woman
Never wanna settle down
Always wanna run around on the low
You can beg, you can plead, you can cry
She won't be your wife
But your eyes are full of tears
She'll be running the streets
With girls hanging out tonight
It's the same thing you do to her

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If the table were turned around
Would you leave? Would you stay?
Would you drown?
If the cards you were dealt were to change
Would you let your hand go up in flames?

[Outro till fades]
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?
What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman was just like you?

What if a woman, what if a woman
What if a woman
Could you ever wonder if she does?"

To my mother, to my father
It's your son or, it's your daughter
Are my screams, loud enough for
You to hear me, should I turn this up for you
[Chorus]
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

[Verse 2]
Your silence, is what kills me
I need someone, here to help me
But you don't know, how to listen
And let me make, my decisions

[Chorus]
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast

[Verse 3]
All your insults, and your curses
Make me feel like I'm not a person
And I feel like, I am nothing
But you made me, so do something
'Cause I'm fucked up, because you are
Need attention, attention you couldn't give
[Chorus]
'Cause I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast
I sit here locked inside my head
Remembering everything you said
The silence, gets us nowhere
Gets us nowhere way too fast"
269,2002,Kenny Chesney,The Good Stuff,"[Verse 1]
Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""
[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""
[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up
Because that's the good stuff
That's the good stuff"""
270,2002,Amerie,Why Don't We Fall In Love,"[Verse 1]
So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly, you and I
We fall in love, so many reasons why

Why don't we fall in love
It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one I never want to go

A love I never felt, now I feel for you
Why don't I just swallow each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do I wanna feel again
Ain't no use for us to pretend

Please come now I think I'm falling
I'm holding on to all I think is safe

And I'm trying to escape
I yelled back when I heard thunder
But I'm down to one last breath
And with it let me say

And I'm thinking maybe six feet
Ain't so far down

I thought I found the road to somewhere
Somewhere in His grace
I cried out, ""Heaven save me""

American girls and American guys
We’ll always stand up and salute, we’ll always recognize
When we see Old Glory flying there’s a lot of men dead
So we can sleep in peace at night when we lay down our head

[Verse 1]
My daddy served in the army where he lost his right eye
But he flew a flag out in our yard 'til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister and me
To grow up and live happy in the land of the free

[Verse 2]
Now this nation that I love has fallen under attack
A mighty sucker punch came flying in from somewhere in the back
Soon as we could see it clearly through our big black eye
Man, we lit up your world like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Oh, brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue
[Bridge]
Oh, justice will be served and the battle will rage
This big dog will fight when you rattle his cage
And you’ll be sorry that you messed with the U.S. of A
`Cause we`ll put a boot in your ass, it`s the American way

[Chorus]
Hey, Uncle Sam put your name at the top of his list
And the Statue of Liberty started shaking her fist
And the eagle will fly and it’s gonna be hell
When you hear Mother Freedom start ringing her bell
And it feels like the whole wide world is raining down on you
Brought to you courtesy of the red, white, and blue

With me getting in the way
Not by design
So I take my face
And bash it into a mirror
I won't have to see the pain
Pain, pain!

As the hurt turns into hating
Anticipating all the fucked up feelings again!

Oh, I cannot give any more

Can I throw it all away?
Take back what's mine

When you're fallin' fast asleep

When you're lyin' close to me
When I hear you softly say my name
When you're high and when you're low
When you don't need me to explain

When you smile that way
I know, every night and day

That's when I love you, when I need you
When I care about you
That's when I know without a doubt
That I can't live without you
Everyday I find another reason
Every season we go through
And every little thing you do
That's when I love you

When you're drivin' in your car
When you dance and sing to the radio
When you're walkin' underneath the stars
Anywhere and everywhere you go
When you're dressed up or you're dressed down
When you're talkin' on the phone
With a million people all around
Or when you're all alone
When you're near, or you're far
You're in my heart no matter where you are

Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits

I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed, I'll hit you

Looking back now, well it makes me laugh
We were growing our hair, we were cutting class
Knew it all already, there was nothing to learn
We were striking matches just to watch them burn
Listen to our music just a little too loud
We were hanging in there with the outcast crowd
Heading to the rapids with some discount beer
It was a long train tussle but we had no fear

[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly
Young

[Verse 2]
Talked a good game when we were out with the guys
But in the back seat we were awkward and shy
Girls were a mystery that we couldn't explain
And I guess there are some things that are never going to change

Man I don't know, where the time goes
But It sure goes fast, just like that

We were brave, we were crazy, we were mostly
Young
Young, Young, Yeah Wishing we were older
Young, Hey I wish it wasn't over
[Chorus]
Man I don't know, where the time goes
But it sure goes fast, just like that
We were want to be rebels who didn't have a clue
With our Rock n roll T-shirts, and our typically bad attitudes
Had no excuses for the things that we'd done
We were brave, we were crazy, and we were mostly

Conversion, software version 7.0
Looking at life through the eyes of a tire hub
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

[Chorus]
You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep
Disorder, disorder, disorder

More wood for their fires, loud neighbors
Flashlight reveries caught in the headlights of a truck
Eating seeds as a pastime activity
The toxicity of our city, of our city

You, what do you own the world? How do you own disorder, disorder?
Now, somewhere between the sacred silence, sacred silence and sleep
Somewhere between the sacred silence and sleep

Talk to me, man… (Ugh-ugh)
It's your boy, Young Hov
And if you turn the motherfucking noise up
We can get right into the proceedings this evening
The headphones are distortin', bring it down a lil' bit
Okay
Now, we working with it (Ugh, ugh)
The boy Face up in Baseline, baby (Facemob!)
Welcome to New York City (Ugh, ugh, ugh)
It's your boy Young Hov' (Chyeah, chyeah)
Kanye West on the track (Woo!)
Chi-Town, what’s going on now? (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Let me talk to y'all for a minute
Just gimme a minute of your time, baby
I don't want much (Woo!)
Let me talk to these motherfuckers
Ugh!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Guess who's bizzack? You still smelling crack in my clothes
Don't make me have to relapse on these hoes
Take it back out to taxing them roads; when I was huggin' it
Niggas couldn't do nothing with it, straight from the oven with it
Came from the dirt
I emerged from it all without a stain on my shirt
You can blame my old earth
For the shit she instilled in me, still with me, pain plus work
Shit, she made me milk this game for all it's worth
That's right, these niggas can't fuck with me
I'm calling ""guts"" every time, drag my nuts every time, homie
We make a great combination, don't we?
Me and the Facemob, every time we face off
Face it, y'all—y'all niggas playin' basic-ball
I'm on the block like I'm eight feet tall (Woo!)
Homie, I'm in the drop with the A/C off
That's why the streets embrace me, dog, I'm so cool!

Guess who's bizzack? Back on the block with them O's
Facemob, Mack Mittens and Hov
Don't make me relapse, back to the block with the four
'Cause this street shit is all I know

From the womb to the tomb, a hot pot, a jar and a spoon
Tryna make me forty thousand and move
Motels, star-studded, rockstars and goons
Plainclothes wanna run in my room (Woooo)
But nigga, guess who's bizzack? It's your boy, Facemob
Started with an eightball, gotta get this cake, dog
Give niggas a break? Nah, you know how the game go
Fuck you think I slang for? To go against the grain? (No!)
I'm out here in grind mode, wrapped up in the paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and candy-paint the '88
Don't got no wholesale, 'cause that ain't how I wanna run it
Here, take these five stones, and bring a nigga back a hundred
Gotta set my feet dude, you do shit a fiend do
The fire get too hot in the kitchen, I hit the streets, fool
Money is an issue, and that's on the fo'-shizzle, my nizzle
Your block warm, and I come by with the fizzle
And make for sure I get to work mines, a car at a time
We go to war, and you ain't making a dime, haha!
'Cause I got shit to lose; a nigga out here paying his dues
My baby walking, gotta get him some shoes
It's a new game brewing, let me give ya the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, ha
It's a new game goin', lemme give you the rules
Get out of line and I'ma give ya the blues, haha! (Whoa)
[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Guess who's bizzack? The boy, B-Mizzack (Yeah)
AKA Mr. Crack-A-Brick (Straight)
Turn a whole one from a half a brick
Look, I mastered this, you can smell it once the plastic rips
A hot plate'll make you swell up if you gasket-clipped
You can make your chips swell up, you don't have to pitch
Play them corners like a safety, watching traffic switch
Young'un, never pump fake, and you'll get past the blitz (Huh)
And keep your whole hood on flip (Ugh)
Like old box-spring, pissy mattress shit
No, won't box a thing, strictly blasting shit
I hug the block like quarter-water (Ugh)
Shit, I used to hug a corner like a old deuce and a quarter
'Til, like, deuce in the morning
With the old heads (Ugh), slangin' loose quarters (Quarters)
This Philly cat back at it (At it)
Still fucking with them crack addicts, still busting with that black-matic

If it weren't for me, you would never have amounted to very much

Ooh, don't go telling everybody

You're a kind of protégé, and one day, you'll say you learned all you know from me and
And I know you depend on me like a young thing would to a guardian
I know you sexualize me like a young thing would, and I think I like ya

What part of our history's reinvented and under rug swept?
What part of your memory is selective and tends to forget?
What with this distance it seems so obvious?

Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to members of your family
We best keep this to ourselves and not tell any members of our inner posse
I wish I could tell the world cause you're such a pretty thing when you're done up properly
I might wanna marry you one day, if you watch that weight and keep your firm body

Ooh, I don't seem to mind

Siempre si el que llega es muy superior

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish, I would've known 'cause I didn't kiss my mama, goodbye!
I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I cared
Or thank my pops for all the talks and all the wisdom he shared
Unaware, I just did what I always do
Every day the same routine before I skate off to school
But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest?
Instead of takin' a test, I took two to the chest
Call me blind, but I didn't see it comin'
Everybody was runnin', but I couldn't hear nothin'
Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid, though I sit by him in class
Maybe this kid was reachin' out for love
Or maybe for a moment he forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was, I know it's because

[Verse 2]
Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world with every chance to excel
Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud, but no respect for herself
She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations just different faces
Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her, she deserved much better
Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules, so you would think he was cool
He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried, often thought of suicide
It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end, they might remember him then
You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt with the sound of a gat
[Chorus]
We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) youth of the nation
We are, we are (we are) the youth of the nation

[Verse 3]
Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim?
No matter what you say, it don't take away the pain
That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why, it's the blind leadin' the blind
I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense? Somebody's got to know
There's gotta be more to life than this
There's gotta be more to everything I thought exists

So I tell 'em what you told me

They ask me what I'm doing now
And in case you're wondering too

I breathe in, I breathe out
Put one foot in front of the other
Take one day at a time
Until you find I'm that someone you can't live without
But until then, I'll breathe in, and breathe out

Now I've got every reason
To find someone new
Cause you swore up and down to me
That I've seen the last of you
But the way that you loved me
Left me hopin' and holdin' on
So until this world stops turnin' round
And my heart believes that you're gone

For once, I'm at peace with myself
I've been burdened with blame
Trapped in the past for too long

Life has been patiently Waiting for me
And I know
There's no guarantees, but I'm not alone
There comes a time in everyone's life
When all you can see are the years passing by (All the years passing by)
And I have made up my mind that those days are gone

I sold what I could
And packed what I couldn't
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town
I've loved like I should, but lived like I shouldn't
I had to lose everything to find out
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road

Rollin' north on 95
With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway
Like a modern day Bonnie and Clyde

We met at a truckstop
Johnson City, Tennessee
I was gassin' up my Firebird
When I heard her callin' me...mmm hmm
Said, 'Which way are you headed, boy
Do you need some company'

She had me stoppin' at a quick mart
Before we made it out of town
Next thing she was runnin' at me
Tellin' me to lay that hammer down
Cause there's a man right behind me
Doin' his best to slow me down

Yeah and it's a long way to Richmond

With a redhead ridin' shotgun
And a pistol by my side
Tearin' down that highway

Well we pulled up to a motel
In the middle of the night
We were countin' all the money
Smokin' stolen Marlboro lights
Lord we never saw 'em comin'
'Til they read us both our rights

My dad chased monsters from the dark
He checked underneath my bed
And he could lift me with one arm
Way up over top his head
He could loosen rusty bolts
With a quick turn of his wrench
He pulled splinters from his hand
Never even flinched

[Pre-Chorus]
In thirteen years I'd never seen him cry
But the day that grandpa died, I realized

[Chorus]
Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

Then there was my junior year
Billy had a brand new car
It was late, the road was wet
I guess the curve was just too sharp
I walked away without a scratch
They brought the helicopter in
And Billy couldn't feel his legs
Said he'd never walk again
[Pre-Chorus]
But Billy said he would and his mom and daddy prayed
And the day we graduated, he stood up to say

Unsinkable ships sink
Unbreakable walls break
Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable
I've learned to never underestimate the impossible

So don't tell me that it's over
Don't give up on you and me
'Cause there's no such thing as hopeless
If you believe

Sometimes the things you think would never happen
Happen just like that
Unbendable steel bends
If the fury of the wind is unstoppable

Mmm, mmm, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't
Depend on how the wind blows, I might even paint my toes
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 2]
When I look in the mirror and the only one there is me
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be, yeah (Haha)
And I know my creator didn't make no mistakes on me
My feet, my thighs, my lips, my eyes, I'm loving what I see (Yeah)
[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Oh)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen (Yeah)
I not the average girl from your video (Ooh)
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes (Oh)
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 3]
Am I less of a lady if I don't wear pantyhose?
My momma said a lady ain't what she wears but what she knows
But I've drawn the conclusion, it's all an illusion
Confusion's the name of the game
A misconception, a vast deception
Something's got to change
Now don't be offended, this is all my opinion
Ain't nothing that I'm saying law
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson
I was sent here to share with y'all
So get in when you fit in, go on and shine
Clear your mind, now's the time
Put your salt on the shelf
Go on and love yourself (Go on and love yourself, go on and love yourself)
‘Cause everything's gonna be alright
[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Oh)
And I ain't built like a supermodel (Yeah)
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie

[Verse 4]
Uh, keep your fancy drinks, and your expensive minks
I don't need that to have a good time
Keep your expensive cars and your caviar
All I need is my guitar
Keep your Cristal and your pistol
I'd rather have a pretty piece of crystal
Don't need your silicone, I prefer my own
What God gave me is just fine (Oh)

[Chorus]
I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes
No matter what I'm wearing I will always be
India.Arie
I'm not the average girl from your video (Yeah)
And I ain't built like a supermodel
But I learned to love myself unconditionally
Because I am a queen
I not the average girl from your video
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes

That's right, Isy', Jadakiss, ya heard?
Let's get it on

[Verse 1]
You got a house on the hill, chromed out ride
You live that life, giving me everything that I dream
All the time on a creep, first class flights
Seas in sights, all night
Never thought that this could take control of me

[Chorus]
Day and night, I don't know what to do
Always on my mind and dreaming of you
It feels so right but I know it is wrong
That I know I gotta man, just can't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
So many nights on the scene
Buying me, shopping sprees, diamond rings
All the things that I can't get at home
Never could understand a thing like me
To utter this from the seen of your face
I'm caught up in love with my secret love

[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Never thought that I would feel this way
All the things that I believed in went away
Right from the start, you took my heart
I'm in love, what can I say

[Jadakiss]
Uh uh uh uh uh, hey yo
You just can't leave me, see me alone
The Porsche is black the B's is chrome
And he's at home and you with me
It's the four point six, three cribs and some jewelry
Don't work I can put you through school for free
So if that's cool with you it's cool with me
Princess ya neck, tennis ya wrist
Anything you wish, Icey and Kiss
Thinkin' of me so what ya really got him for
Let's go to the mall and close down the Prada store
And even if ya don't rock diamonds
Baby you'll like to go deep-sea fishin' and rock climbin'
Pop wine and horseback ridin'
You shotgun scared, use the Porshe back slidin'
And ya friends say J ain't right
But you know we go together like day and night, uh

[Chorus with variations to end]"
299,2002,Hoobastank,Crawling In The Dark,"[Verse 1]
I will dedicate and sacrifice my every
Thing for just a second's worth of how my story's ending
And I wish I could know if the directions that I take
And all the choices that I make won't end up all for nothing

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

[Verse 2]
Help me carry on, assure me it's OK to
Use my heart and not my eyes to navigate the darkness
Will the ending be ever coming suddenly?
Will I ever get to see the ending to my story?

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer

[Rap]
So when and how will I know?
[Bridge]
How much further do I have to go?
And how much longer 'til I finally know?
`Cause I'm looking and I just can't see what's in front of me
In front of me

[Chorus]
Show me what it's for, make me understand it
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer
Is there something more than what I've been handed?
I've been crawling in the dark looking for the answer"

Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Baby girl, you know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litigations
And I respect you, gangsta
Treat you like a princess and put some on your neck to thank ya
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin' lineup ain't playin' right
I come off the bench wit' her
It might sound like I'm gassin' ya
But it take time to get from the backseat to the passenger
We been creepin' and sneakin' just to keep it from leakin'
We so deep in our freakin' that we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonder why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright, if y'all bump heads, it'll be a fight (Mmm)
But I said it'll be alright, c'mon

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
[Verse 2: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
You ain't never step outta line or get outta pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket (Oh)
You gon' play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page, weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry 'bout you tellin' the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin' I denied
Somethin' I would slide just to do somethin' in the ride
But shorty, there's somethin' you provide
'Cause the entrée ain't as good (Mmm)
Without somethin' on the side, you know?

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
[Verse 3: Fabolous, Lil' Mo]
Uh
Uh-oh, I might be leavin' the earth soon
My girl gon' kill me if she smell the scent of your perfume
It's gon' be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me wit' a empty Magnum wrapper (Ooh, yeah)
So keep it on the down low, call the car celly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You seen what happened with Mr. Bigg and R Kelly, uh
You know I care for you (Care for you)
Anytime this chick is there for you (There for you, yeah)
These feelings I'ma share wit' you
Which makes it a little more clear for you

[Chorus: Mike Shorey, Lil' Mo, Both]
I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life (Want in my life)
I already got a wife (Got a wife)
I can't leave you alone (No)
And I know I'm livin' wrong
But I can't let you go

I really wanna be wit' you (Be wit' you)
But I gotta be real wit' you (Real wit' you)

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, where I've become so numb
Without a soul, my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

[Chorus: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real, bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside

Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run
I can't wake up, before I come undone
Save me, save me from the nothing I've become
[Bridge: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
Bring me to life, I've been livin' a lie, there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch, without your love, darling
Only you are the life among the dead

[Verse 3: Amy Lee & Paul McCoy]
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life

Wake me up, wake me up inside
I can't wake up, wake me up inside
Save me, call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up, bid my blood to run

I'll do it anywhere, anyhow, I'm down for anything
Couple of humps, give a nigga goosebumps
This junk in my trunk ain't made for chumps
When Lil' Kim's around you don't need to lie
It's the ""Drugs"", baby, I'm makin ya high!
[Chorus 3: 50 Cent & (Lil' Kim)]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
(I am the baddest chick)
(Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight)
(And I'll show you magic - what? What?)
Magic (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
(I got the magic clit)

[Verse 3: Lil' Kim & (50 Cent)]
Now put your face in it
I know you sprung off in your tongue, I know you tasting it
(Sex ain't a race) But I have a thug nigga breakin records
And the time is (One minute, six seconds)
(Magic stick) I got the magic box
Have that ass trickin' after one back shot
(The gifts, the ice, I like that a lot)
The minks, the leathers, the CL drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got the magic stick
I know if I can hit once, I can hit twice
I hit the baddest chicks
Shorty don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic
(What? What?) Magic
I got the magic stick
[Chorus: Lil' Kim]
I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic

Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
And we gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now Shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
But somewhere in this darkness
There's a light that I can't find
Well maybe it's too far away, yeah
Or maybe I'm just blind
Or maybe I'm just blind

So hold me when I'm here
Right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared

You can hold me when I'm scared
You won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone
Love me when I'm gone

When your education x-ray
Cannot see under my skin

But part of me is gone

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave, I'm beggin' you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feelin', and my pride is the one to blame (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

When I talk to my friends so quietly
(""Who he think he is?"") Look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

They can't figure him out, they like, ""Hey, is he insane?""
Yes sir, I'm cut from a different cloth
My texture is the best fur - chinchilla

How you think I got the name Hova?

Fall back, Young
Ever since I made the change over to platinum
The game's been a wrap, one

You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
'Cause baby, you got me, you got me

Beautiful, I just want you to know
You're my favorite girl
Beautiful, I just want you to know

After all you put me through
You'd think I'd despise you
But in the end, I wanna thank you
'Cause you made me that much stronger

[Verse 1]
Well, I thought I knew you
Thinkin' that you were true
Guess I, I couldn't trust, called your bluff
Time is up 'cause I've had enough
You were there by my side
Always down for the ride
But your joy ride just came down in flames
'Cause your greed sold me out in shame, mhm

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the stealing and cheating
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
But uh-uh, oh no, you're wrong
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
I wouldn't know just how capable
I am to pull through
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
Makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah, ohh
[Verse 2]
Never saw it coming
All of your backstabbing
Just so you could cash in on a good thing
Before I realized your game, aha
I heard you're goin' 'round
Playin' the victim now
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame
'Cause you dug your own grave

[Pre-Chorus]
After all of the fights and the lies
Guess you're wanting to hold me
But that won't work anymore (No more, a-ha, it's over)
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down
So I wanna say thank you, 'cause it

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter
[Bridge]
How could this man I thought I knew
Turn out to be unjust, so cruel?
Could only see the good in you
Pretended not to see the truth
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself
Through living in denial
But in the end you'll see, you won't stop me
I am a fighter and I (I'm a fighter)
I ain't gon' stop (I ain't gonna stop)
There is no turning back
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger
Makes me work a little bit harder (Yeah)
It makes me that much wiser (Oh yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster (Yeah)
Made my skin a little bit thicker (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Makes me that much smarter (Yeah)
So thanks for making me a fighter (Fighter)

[Interlude]
You thought I would forget but I, I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I remembered
You thought I would forget (Ooh-ooh)
I remembered (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause I remembered (Ooh)
I remembered
[Chorus]
Makes me that much stronger (Ooh-ooh)
Makes me work a little bit harder (Ooh-ooh)
It makes me that much wiser
So thanks for making me a fighter
Made me learn a little bit faster
Made my skin a little bit thicker
Makes me that much smarter
So thanks for making me a fighter"
320,2003,Daniel Bedingfield,If You're Not The One,"[Verse 1]
If you're not the one, then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one, then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine, then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine, would I have the strength to stand at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

[Verse 2]
If I don't need you, then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you, then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me, then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me, then why do I dream of you as my wife?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I'm praying you're the one I build my home with
I hope, I love you all my life
[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?

[Bridge]
'Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
'Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side

[Chorus]
I don't wanna run away, but I can't take it, I don't understand
If I'm not made for you, then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?"

Miss independent
Miss self-sufficient
Miss keep your distance
Miss unafraid
Miss out of my way
Miss don't let a man interfere, no
Miss on her own
Miss almost grown
Miss never let a man help her off her throne
So, by keeping her heart protected
She'd never ever feel rejected
Little miss apprehensive
Said ooh, she fell in love

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

[Verse 2]
Miss guarded heart
Miss play it smart
Miss if you wanna use that line, you better not start, no
But she miscalculated
She didn't wanna end up jaded
And this miss decided not to miss out on true love
So, by changing her misconceptions
She went in a new direction
And found inside, she felt a connection
She fell in love
[Chorus]
What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door (Open the door)
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you (Old you)
When love is true

[Bridge]
When Miss Independent walked away
No time for love that came her way
She looked in the mirror and thought today
What happened to miss no longer afraid?
It took some time for her to see
How beautiful love could truly be
No more talk of ""Why can't that be me?""
I'm so glad I finally see

[Chorus]
What is this feelin' taking over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise (Surprise), it's time
To feel (To feel) what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye (Goodbye), old you
When love, when love is true

I can't believe you had the nerve to say the things you said
They hurt so bad that they ended our relationship
I can't believe it, four years go down the drain
Oh, how I wish things would have happened so differently
I tried to save us so many times, but still, you couldn't see
You kept insistin' and resistin' that you would not fall again

You keep insisting when you know our love is out the door
Don't wanna try, don't wanna try 'cause all we do is fight

Don't wanna try, don't wanna try, I've about just had enough

Talks about one day we having a place of our own
Wake up in the morning and have breakfast ready on the table

Had to wake up, face reality

From that moment on I knew you were the one, yeah
(I was single, you was lonely and we fell in love)
We would sit and talk for hours about anything
(Baby, you hang up, no, you hang up, on three hang up)
I bought your whip, I paid your rent, I gave you everything
(Said you'd always be my baby then you bounced)
How you gonna?

How you gonna up and leave me now?
How you gonna act like that?
How you gonna change it up, we just finished makin' up?

How you gonna act like we don't be makin' love
You know we be tearin' it up, breakin' stuff, that ghetto love
How you gonna trip, how could you forget
How you gonna act like that

Girl, I never thought that lovin' you would hurt
(I did everything a good man would to make it work)
Girl, you should have told me you had second thoughts

[Verse 1]
The only ground I ever owned was stickin' to my shoes
Now I look at my front porch at this panoramic view
I can sit and watch the fields fill up with rays of golden sun
Or watch the moon lay on the fences like that's where it was hung

[Pre-Chorus]
My blessings aren't in front of me
It's not about the land
I'll never beat the view
Of my front porch looking in

[Chorus]
There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in
[Verse 2]
I've traveled here and everywhere following my job
I've seen the paintings from the air brushed by the hand of God
The mountains and the canyons reach from sea to shining sea
But I can't wait to get back home to the one He made for me

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause anywhere I'll ever go
And everywhere I've been
Nothing takes my breath away
Like my front porch looking in

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in

I've seen what beautiful is about
When I'm looking in
Not when I'm looking out

There's a carrot top who can barely walk
With a sippy cup of milk
A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong
'Cause she likes to dress herself
And the most beautiful girl
Holding both of them
Yeah, the view I love the most
Oh, the view I love the most
Is my front porch looking in, yeah

Oh, there's a carrot top who can barely walk

A little blue eyed blonde with shoes on wrong, yeah
And the most beautiful girl holding both of them, oh, yeah

These ideas are nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing
To see him walkin' around with his headphones blarin'
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care, he's
A problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out (Bitch!)
'Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back
Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stockin' cap
His stepfather hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsters
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely ‘cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate (Huh-uh)
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you (Yep), journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously
So I'm signin' CDs while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter, but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense, B
It's all political, if my music is literal
And I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you! (Bitch!)
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
(Come on!) Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Sing that shit!)
Sing it with me, it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away

[Verse 3: Eminem]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well, if it can, then the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault and I'll get sued
See, what these kids do is hear about us totin' pistols
And they wanna get one ‘cause they think the shit's cool
Not knowin' we really just protectin' ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin' our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up, ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin'
To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted
That's why we sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine (Ha-ha!)
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night, wishin' they'd die
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothin' to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes
That's why we seize the moment, try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it ‘cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits
Live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs, and we can…
[Chorus: Steven Tyler (& Eminem)]
Sing with me (Sing!), sing for the year (Sing it!)
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear (Come on!)

You look at me, but you're not quite sure
Am I it or could you get more?
You learn cool from magazines
You learned love from Charlie Sheen

If you want me, let me know

330,2003,Randy Travis,Three Wooden Crosses,"[Verse 1]
A farmer and a teacher, a hooker and a preacher
Riding on a midnight bus bound for Mexico
One was headed for vacation, one for higher education
And two of them were searching for lost souls
That driver never ever saw the stop sign
And eighteen wheelers can't stop on a dime

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Verse 2]
That farmer left a harvest, a home, and eighty acres
The faith and love for growing things in his young son's heart
And that teacher left her wisdom in the minds of lots of children
And did her best to give 'em all a better start
And that preacher whispered, ""Can't you see the Promised Land?""
As he laid his blood-stained Bible in that hooker's hand

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, Heaven only knows
I guess it's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go
[Bridge]
That's the story that our preacher told last Sunday
As he held that blood-stained Bible up for all of us to see
He said, ""Bless the farmer, and the teacher, and the preacher
Who gave this Bible to my mama, who read it to me""

[Chorus]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway
Why there's not four of them, now I guess we know
It's not what you take when you leave this world behind you
It's what you leave behind you when you go

[Outro]
There are three wooden crosses on the right side of the highway"

The day that we first met (The day that we first met)
Wasn't looking for what I found
But I found you and I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

333,2003,Diamond Rio,I Believe,"Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And it's like you haven't been
Gone a moment from my sight
Like the tears were never cried
Like the hands of time were holding you and me

And with all my heart I'm sure
We're closer than we ever were
I don't have to hear or see
I've got all the proof I need
There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Now when you die, your life goes on
It doesn't end here when you're gone
Every soul is filled with light
It never ends, if I'm right
Our love can even reach across eternity
I believe
Oh, I believe

Forever, you're a part of me
Forever in the heart of me
I would hold you even longer if I can
Oh, the people who don't see the most
See that I believe in ghosts
If that makes me crazy, then I am
'Cause I believe
Oh, I believe

There are more than angels watching over me
I believe
Oh, I believe

Every now and then
Soft as breath upon my skin
I feel you come back again
And I believe"

I never let anybody know just how
Much I was so deep in love
But now that you're in my arms

I'm gonna stand on a rooftop
Climb up a mountaintop

I love to love you out loud

You keep bringing out the free in me
What you do to my heart just makes me melt

But I've never been one to kiss and tell
Our love this true, can't be subdued
So I'm gonna let out a yell

335,2003,Amanda Perez,Angel,"[Verse 1]
It's been five months since you went away
You left without a word and nothing to say (Nothing to say)
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you, no
So I asked God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (Is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes

[Verse 2]
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that, I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there's something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
'Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love
'Cause all I do is cry (All I do is cry)
God send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes
(Send me an angel)
[Bridge]
Now you had me on my knees
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love (give you all my love)
But you took my love for granted
Want my lovin' now, but you can't have it
So, God

[Chorus]
God send me an angel (Send me an angel)
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God, send me (God send me an angel)
An angel (Wipe the tears from my eyes)
Oh baby
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel (God send me an angel)
From being in love (Send me an angel)
Oh God, send me an angel
Send me an angel (Send me an angel)

Tides that I tried to swim against

A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'

Confusion never stops
Closing walls and tickin' clocks
Gonna come back and take you home

Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure?
Or am I part of the disease? Singin'

On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we want to go

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone

[Verse 2]
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on

[Chorus]
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone

[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And on I read until the day was gone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on

In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone"

It ticks just like a Timex

The job is never through
It'll run us till we're ragged
It'll harden our hearts
And love could use a day of rest
Before we both start falling apart

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Storming like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday

Your love is like religion
A cross in Mexico
And your kiss is like the innocence
Of a prayer nailed to a door
Oh surrender in much sweeter
When we both let it go
Let the water wash our bodies clean
And love wash our souls

Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon
Baby whatever comes Monday
Can take care of itself
Because we got better things that we could do
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday
Let it rain
Pray that it's raining on Sunday
Stormin' like crazy
We'll hide under the covers all afternoon

Because we got better things that we could do

When it's raining on Sunday
When it's raining on Sunday

If you just stay gone

I still love you

We can't hide the truth

A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love

[Verse 2: Michelle Branch]
It's whatever you make it to be
Sunshine instead of this cold lonely sea
So, please, baby, try
And use me for what I'm good for
It ain't saying goodbye
It's knocking down the door of your candy store
[Chorus: Michelle Branch]
It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
It's all in this game of love

[Bridge: Michelle Branch]
You roll me, control me, console me
Please hold me
You guide me, divide me into one
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Michelle Branch]
So please tell me why
Don't you come around no more?
'Cause right now I'm dying
Outside the door of your loving store

[Chorus: Michelle Branch]
It just takes a little bit of this
A little bit of that
It started with a kiss
Now we're up to bat
A little bit of laughs
A little bit of pain
I'm telling you, my babe
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
It's all in this game of love
It's all in the game of love
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Let's play the game of love
[Outro: Michelle Branch]
Roll me, control me, please hold me
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)
Make me feel good, yeah
(A little bit of laughs, a little bit of pain)
Now here on my own, on my own
(A little bit of this, a little bit of that)

My jump off never ask why I go out so much
My jump off never has me goin' out of my way

346,2003,Darryl Worley,Have You Forgotten?,"I hear people sayin'. We don't need this war
But I say there's some things worth fightin' for
What about our freedom and this piece of ground?
We didn't get to keep em' by backing down
They say we don't realize the mess we're gettin in
Before you start your preachin' let me ask you this my friend

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And you say we shouldn't worry about Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
They took all the footage off my TV
Said it's too disturbin for you and me
It'll just breed anger is what the experts say
If it was up to me I'd show it every day
Some say this country's just out lookin' for a fight
Well after 9-11 man I'd have to say that's right

Chorus
Have you forgotten how it felt that day
To see your homeland under fire
And her people blown away
Have you forgotten when those towers fell
We had neighbors still inside goin through a livin hell
And we vow to get the ones behind Bin Laden
Have you forgotten?
I'v been there with the soldiers
Who've gone away to war
And you can bet that they remember just what they're fighting for

Have you forgotten
All the people killed
Yes some went down like heroes
In that Pennsylvania field
Have you forgotten
About our Pentagon
All the loved ones that we lost
And those left to carry on
Don't you tell me not to worry 'bout Bin Laden

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?

Have you forgotten?!"
347,2003,Nas,I Can,"[Intro: Children's Choir]
I know I can
Be what I wanna be
If I work hard at it
I'll be where I wanna be
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 1]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)
[Verse 3]
Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
[Chorus x2]
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

(When this began) I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

[Chorus: Chester Bennington & (Mike Shinoda)]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda & (Chester Bennington)]
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Looking everywhere, only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

355,2003,Stacie Orrico,Stuck,"[Verse 1]
I can't get out of bed today or get you off my mind
I just can't seem to find a way to leave the love behind
I ain't trippin', I'm just missin' you
You know what I'm sayin', you know what I mean
You kept me hangin' on a string
Why you make me cry?
I tried to give you everything, but you just give lies
I ain't trippin', I'm just missin' you
You know what I'm sayin', you know what I mean
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every now and then, when I'm all alone
I've been wishin' you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back, but you never do
I feel like such a fool, there's nothing I can do
I'm such a fool for you

[Chorus]
I can't take it
What am I waiting for?
My heart's still breaking
I miss you even more
And I can't fake it
The way I could before
I hate you, but I love you
I can't stop thinkin' of you
It's true, I'm stuck on you
[Verse 2]
Now love's a broken record that's been skippin' in my head
I keep singing yesterday
Why we got to play these games we play?
I ain't trippin', I'm just missin' you
You know what I'm sayin', you know what I mean
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every now and then, when I'm all alone
I've been wishin' you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back, but you never do
I feel like such a fool

[Chorus]
I can't take it
What am I waiting for?
My heart's still breaking
I miss you even more
And I can't fake it
The way I could before
I hate you, but I love you
I can't stop thinkin' of you
It's true, I'm stuck on you
You
Yeah

Every now and then, when I'm all alone
I've been wishin' you would call me on the telephone
Say you want me back, but you never do
I feel like such a fool, there's nothing I can do
I'm such a fool for you

I can't take it
What am I waiting for?

I miss you even more
And I can't fake it

I can't stop thinkin' of you
I hate you, but I love you

I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
I need to get there pretty quick
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch

Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
All that really concerns me is

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

I'd like to trade in this old truck
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and talk
On the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
And I need to move on
So give me
Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory
Yeah, what I really need
Is an open road
And a whole lot of speed

Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
Let me lean on that gas
Oh she catches up fast
So give me

Speed
How fast will it go
Can it get me
Over her quickly
Zero to sixty
Can it outrun her memory

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed

Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small

Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know

The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch

361,2003,Heather Headley,I Wish I Wasn't,"[Verse 1]
I'm home alone again
And you're out, hanging with your friends
So you say, somehow I know its not quite that way
It's getting pretty late, and you haven't checked on me all day
When I called, you didn't answer
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me
I wish,that you were home, holding me tight in your arms
I wish,I could go back, to the day before we met and skip my regret

[Chorus]
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me
It just ain't fair the way you treat me
No you don't deserve me
Wasted my time thinking bout you and you ain't never gone change
I wish I wasn't in love with you so I wouldn't feel this way

[Verse 2]
When you touch me my heart melts
And everything you did wrong I forget
So you play me and take advantage of the love that I feel for you
Why you wanna hurt me so bad
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and it's hard for me to even look at you
I wish, that you were home, holding me tight in your arms. Oooh baby
I wish, I could go back
To the day before we met and skip my regret
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Said you care about me, but from what I see
I ain't feeling all that, so I disagree
Gave you all my love and understanding
Yet you treated me like your enemy
So leave me alone, don't want nothin' from you
Just go back where you came from
This house is no longer your home
You're not welcome no, no, no,more

[Chorus x 2]

[Outro]
Hear you knockin' at the door again
I'm wonderin' should I let you in
I open up the door and see
The flowers for me
So
Beautiful in your hand
Please stop begging me to take you back
I've always been a sucker for romance
And before you know
It I concede
You're all over me
Oh no here I go again
I wish I wasn't in love with you
So you couldn't hurt me"

Well, I saw fireworks from the freeway
And behind closed eyes, I cannot make them go away
'Cause you were born on the fourth of July, freedom ring
Well, something on the surface, it stings
I said, something on the surface, well, it kinda makes me nervous who says that you deserve this?
And what kind of god would serve this?
We will cure this dirty old disease
Well, if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
The remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison
I says, the comedy is that it's serious
Which is a strange enough new play on words
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend
The rest of your nights with the light on
So shine the light on all of your friends
When it all amounts to nothing in the end

I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
I, I won't worry my life away
Hey, oh, oh
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard two men talking on the radio
In a cross fire kind of new reality show
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack
While they were counting down the ways to stab the brother in the be right back after this
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophe
Dance with me, 'cause if you've gots the poison, I've gots the remedy

This is a dangerous liaison

There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind
You can turn off the sun (Turn off the sun), but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why

Because the remedy is the experience
This is a dangerous liaison

363,2003,Brooks & Dunn,Red Dirt Road,"[Verse 1]
I was raised off of Rural Route 3
Out past where the blacktop ends
We'd walked to church on Sunday morning
Race barefoot back to the Johnson's fence
That's where I first saw Mary
On that roadside pickin' blackberries
That summer I turned a corner in my soul
Down that red dirt road

[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Verse 2]
Her daddy didn't like me much
With my shackled up GTO
I'd sneak out in the middle of the night
Throw rocks at her bedroom window
We'd turn out the headlights
Drive by the moonlight
Talk about what the future might hold
Down that red dirt road
[Chorus]
It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers
I've learned I've come to know
There's life at both ends
Of that red dirt road

[Bridge]
I went out into the world
And I came back in
I lost Mary
Oh, I got her back again
And driving home tonight
Feels like I've found a long lost friend

It's where I drank my first beer
It's where I found Jesus
Where I wrecked my first car
I tore it all to pieces
I learned the path to heaven
Is full of sinners and believers
Learned that happiness on earth
Ain't just for high achievers

364,2003,Train,Calling All Angels,"[Verse 1]
I need a sign to let me know you're here
All of these lines are being crossed over the atmosphere
I need to know that things are gonna look up
'Cause I feel us drowning in a sea spilled from a cup
When there is no place safe
And no safe place to put my head
When you feel the world shake
From the words that are said

[Chorus]
And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up
I won't give up if you don't give up

I need a sign to let me know you're here
'Cause my TV set just keeps it all from being clear
I want a reason for the way things have to be
I need a hand to help build up
Some kind of hope inside of me

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

When children have to play inside
So they don't disappear
While private eyes solve marriage lies
'Cause we don't talk for years
And football teams are kissing queens
And losing sight of having dreams
In a world that what we want
Is only what we want until it's ours

And I'm calling all angels
And I'm calling all you angels

And I'm calling all angels

He had plastic bags wrapped 'round his shoes
He was covered with the evening news
Had a pair of old wool socks on his hands
The bank sign was flashin' 5 below
It was freezing rain and spittin' snow
He was curled up behind some garbage cans

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I was afraid that he was dead, I gave him a gentle shake
When he opened up his eyes, I said, ""Old man are you OK?""

[Chorus]
He said, ""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home""

[Verse 2]
Then he said, ""I's just comin' 'round the barn
'Bout the time you grabbed my arm
When I heard mama holler, ""Son, hurry up""
I was close enough for my old nose
To smell fresh cobbler on the stove
And I saw daddy loadin' up the truck

Cane poles on the tailgate, bobbers blowin' in the wind
Since July of '55, that's as close as I've been""

[Chorus]
""Yeah, I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home""

[Bridge]
I said ,""Old man you're gonna freeze to death
Let me drive you to the mission""
He said, ""Boy, if you'd've left me alone
Right now I'd be fishin'""

[Chorus]
""I just climbed out of a cottonwood tree
I was runnin' from some honey bees
Drip-dryin' in the summer breeze
After jumpin' into Calico creek
I was walkin' down an old dirt road
Past a field of hay that had just been mowed
Man, I wish you'd just left me alone
'Cause I was almost home"" (Almost home)
[Outro]
Man I wish you'd just left me alone
I was almost home"
366,2003,Tim McGraw,She's My Kind Of Rain,"[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love in a drunken sky
She's confetti falling
Down all night

[Verse 1]
She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess like a child

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Verse 2]
She's the sun set shadows
She's like Rembrandt's light
She's the history that's made at night
She's my lost companion
She's my dreaming tree
Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold
[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Pre-Chorus]
So I wait
And I try
I confess all my crimes

[Chorus]
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain
She's my kind of rain
Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

[Outro]
She's my kind of rain
Oh, rain on me
She's my kind of rain"
367,2003,Kenny Chesney,Big Star,"[Verse 1]
She was aware of her insecurities
As she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered someday

[Pre-Chorus]
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar where
She sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are it feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2]
She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place

[Pre-Chorus]
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small-time town was hers
[Verse 3]
She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertains is
Where they are and where she is now

[Verse 4]
All her old neighbors swear they're certain
She slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you are going
Unless you got something they have not got

[Pre-Chorus]
So she sings tonight to twenty thousand plus
And the young girls scream out loud
Man, that could be us

[Chorus]
She's a big star as she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night
She says if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She's a big star
She's a big star"
368,2003,Jeff Bates,The Love Song,"First time i felt it
I think I was five years old
I was scared, had a nightmare
Mama was there for me to hold

Daddy he was different
He never said it much
But I heard him loud and clear
When he brought home that ball and glove

And it took on a brand new meaning
I wasn't just a boy no more
When she moved in next door...

Where you from?
What's your name?
Wanna go to my game?
Got the keys to my dad's old truck
Turn the radio on
Still remember the song
We held hands and there it was
Love....

The page just kept on turning
There i was with someone else
First time in my life time
I wasn't livin for myself
I knew i wasn't fallin
Anywhere I fell before
This place was different
It was deeper it was more...
Then it took on a brand new meaning
Yeah it was strong and it was true
Knew what I had to do...

Found a ring
Hit my knees
Couldn't talk
Couldn't breathe...
My heart had me all choked up
Said ""I do,""
As we cried
Wedding bells
Waved good bye
The whole church knew it was
Love....

Then it took on a brand new meaning
When the docter said ""It's time to watch your miracle arrive.""

Thank the Lord
Cut the cord
Take her home
Help her grow
And complete the circle of
Love......"

I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, ahh!

[Hook: Ludacris]
You just came home from doin a bid
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Somebody broke in and cleaned out your crib
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Just bought a new pair and they scuffed your shoes
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them cops tryna throw you in them county blues
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Talkin' about gats, traps, cops and robbers
It's 9-1-1, please call the doctor!
Evacuate the building and trick the pigs
Since everybody wanna piece, we gon split ya wigs
See some fools slipped up and over-stepped they boundaries
You about to catch a cold, stay the fuck around me!
Ya peeps talkin 'bout ""What kinda shits he on?""
You disappear like ""Poof, bitch be gone!""
You think twelve gon' catch me? Gimme a break!
I'm super-charged with the hide-away license plate
It seems they wanna finger print me and gimme some years
They'll only get one finger while I'm shifting gears
I got suede on my roof, wood grain on the dash
Sheep skin on the rug, Golden Grain on the stash
Hydraulics all around so I shake the ride
We go front, back and side to side, what?!
[Hook: Ludacris]
Some punk just tripped up and made you spill your drink
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your car just stopped on a empty tank
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you got late bills and you lost your job
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If you about to get drunk and you ready to mob
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Let's take it to the streets 'cause I'm ready to cruise
Just bought me and my cars all some brand new shoes
And the people just stare so I love to park it
And I just put a computer in the glove compartment
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the grill
TV in the middle of my steering wheel
It's my car's birthday, so we blowin' them candles
More speakers in the trunk than my ride can handle
Got my name in the headrest, read it and weep
NOS tank in the back, camel hair on the seat
And when I pull up to the club, I get all the affection
'Cause the women love the paint and they can see their reflection
I'm about to take off, so F what ya heard
Because my side mirrors flap like a fuckin' bird
And the fools, we gon' clock one and we'll pop one
'Cause my folk ridin shotgun with a shotgun
[Hook: Ludacris]
You just got hustled for a wad of cash
Man whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now your friends just smoked up your brand new stash
Say whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If anyone talk bad about the Dirty South
Tell me what I'm gon' do? Act a fool!

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
Did donuts last week and the streets still smoking
See, I'm off that anti-freeze and my car is tipsy
Off the off-ramp, doin' about a hundred and fifty
Rollin through East Point, on way to Ben Hill
Slide a five to the junkie to clean my windshield
Got the whole crew ridin' and we startin' shit
I even got a trailer hitch with the barbeque pit
Now all you wanna do is get drunk and pout
Plus your new name is Fire 'cause we stomped you out
And yeah, we blow trees and beez that's fantastic
So girls, hold ya weave while I'm weaving through traffic
I kicked to fifth gear and teared the road apart
You'll be like lil John Q and get a Change of Heart
It's one mission, two clips and some triple beams
I'm about to blow this whole shit up to smithereens!
[Hook: Ludacris]
The pot holes in the street just bentcha rims
Tell me whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Man, that ain't sticky, that's just sticks and stems!
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
Catch ya man with another bitch up in ya bed
Ladies, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!
If the bottle's all gone and your eyes are red
Boy, whatcha gon' do? Act a fool!

[Outro: Ludacris]
2 Fast (2 Fast), 2 Furious (2 Furious)

If money grew on hackberry trees
If time wasn't such a luxury
If love was lovesick over me
That'd be alright
If I could keep the wind in my sails
Keep a hold of the tiger by the tail
A half a ham sandwich in my lunch pail
That'd be alright

[Chorus]
Yeah, that'd be alright
That'd be alright
If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear
And a little bigger piece of the pie
We'd be living us a pretty good life
And that'd be alright

[Verse 2]
Hey, go heavy on the good and light on the bad
A hair more happy and a shade less sad
Turn all that negative down just a tad
That'd be alright
If my dear old dog never got old
If my family farm never got sold
If another bad joke never got told
That'd be alright
[Chorus][x3]
Yeah, that'd be alright

If everybody, everywhere
Had a lighter load to bear

All the high rollin' cats wanna pay for that ass

I watched 'em drive away over the hill
Not against her will

Down in Brokenheartsville

Sittin' in the lot
And fire engine red
That thing was hot

She waved goodbye
Well, love's gone to hell

So hot to trot, lady!
Excuse me miss, what's your name?

Possibly, can I take you out, tonight?

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
You already know what it's hittin' for
Ma, I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin' on
50/50 venture with them S Dots kickin' off
Armadale poppin' now, only bring a nigga more
Only thing missin' is a Missus
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner
To play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST
Who else you gon' run with? The truth is us
Only dudes movin' units - Em, Pimp Juice and us
It's the Roc in here!
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears
PJ's on the runway, Young got air
I don't land at an airport, I call it the clearport
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more
Back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sexcuse me... damn!
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody's like, ""He's no item! Please don't like him
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!""
Now she don't like him, she never met him
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em
Better them than me, she don't agree with him
She's mad at that, he's not havin' that
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that
He 2-ways her, so she writes back
Smiley faces after all of her phrases
Either she the one or I'm caught in The Matrix
But fuck it, let the Fishburne
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Pharrell]
Sex-cuse me, damn!
You gotta throw on your fine linens for this one
You're so contagious, I can't take it
Have my baby, let's just make it
You might go, you mighta gotta go get you some Scooby Doo's
Lady
Gotta throw on ya Scooby Doo's; those are shoes by the way

Yo, my time wasn't enough
My heart wasn't enough
Money wasn't enough

And now you're gonna leave?

I wish I never told you you should leave
I wish me and you never had my seed
No, I better stop it that's a lie

Even though I said that you could leave me
I wanted other chances to adore you
I still believe in you and me

I wasn't ready for you to set me free
Don't give our love away, hey

Words cannot describe how I feel about you
Only heaven knows how much I do
Girl, I'd put my own life on the line

I'd die without your love, baby, if you leave
I could let you walk away, but baby im not goin out that way

Tal vez sera que esa historia ya tiene final
No se porque hoy te siento tan distante de mí
Que a pesar que lo intento de nuevo
Tal vez llegue tarde, ya no hay nada que hacer
Y no puedo creer que el tiempo que hemos tenido tal vez se nos gastó

[Chorus]
Tal vez fui yo que no te dio una noche entera
Tal vez nunca te he dado lo que tú esperabas
Y no estaba cuando me necesitabas
Tal vez no te escuche,Tal vez me descuide
Tal vez se me olvido que yo te amaba

[Verse 2]
Tal vez será que por ahora ya no hay nada que hablar
Tal vez esta vez necesitamos tiempo para pensar
Y yo por mi parte propongo intentarlo de nuevo,volver a empezar
Que por más que lo pienso no encuentro una sola razón para seguir sin tí

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Tal vez me sorprendio la vida por la espalda
Y tira y tira y se rompió la cuerda
Tal vez nunca entendí lo que eras para mí
Tal vez yo nunca supe a quien amaba

She walks to school with the lunch she packed
Nobody knows what she's holdin' back
Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday
She hides the bruises with linen and lace

[Verse 2]
The teacher wonders, but she doesn't ask
It's hard to see the pain behind the mask
Bearin' the burden of a secret storm
Sometimes she wishes she was never born

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

Somebody cries in the middle of the night
The neighbours hear, but they turn out the light
A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate
When mornin' comes it'll be too late

Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel

[Verse 3]
A statue stands in a shaded place
An angel girl with an upturned face
A name is written on a polished rock
A broken heart that the world forgot

[Chorus]
Through the wind and the rain
She stands hard as a stone
In a world that she can't rise above
But her dreams give her wings
And she flies to a place where she's loved
Concrete angel"

Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin'
Ridin' on these niggas ‘cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy, still heavy in this game—can you feel me?
Blame it on my mama, I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga, then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, WESTSIDE!
Ain't nobody loved me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California is where I'm at
Ridin', passed by while these niggas wondered why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga, tears shed
For all my homies in the pen', many peers dead; nigga, still ballin'

With clientele, any rhyme sells
Question is: will you fuck-niggas ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga, this is G-rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi

And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit; still ballin'

Two murdered on the front page
Shot to death, bullets to the head

389,2003,Vivian Green,Emotional Rollercoaster,"[Verse 1:]
Last night, I cried, tossed and turned
Woke up with dry eyes
My mind was racing
Feet were pacing
Lord, help me please
Tell me what I have gotten into

Ran my three miles to clear my mind
It always helps me out
It's my therapy
When I'm losing it which is usually

[Chorus:]
I'm on a emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me
But I can't get off

It's emotional rollercoaster
Loving you ain't nothing healthy
Loving you was never good for me (for me)
But I can't get off

[Verse 2:]
Yesterday, I told myself
I was gonna be okay
Gonna start a new day
Be truly happy
I was gonna take control of me
But eventually reality hit me
Mentally, physically, emotionally
And I opened my eyes and realized
That I was still being
Taken for a constant ride on your

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
So tired of you making love to me
Then disappearing so suddenly
Up and down it goes
And I'm so tired of you pacifying me
With promises you know
That you'll never keep
Round and round it goes

390,2003,Good Charlotte,The Anthem,"[Intro]
Yeah...
Here we go...

[Verse 1]
It's a new day, but it all feels old
""It's a good life!"" That's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school, it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there, it only made me see

[Pre-Chorus]
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say
And I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be

[Chorus]
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 2]
""Go to college or university
Get a real job!"" That's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Out of step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat, so pay no mind
[Pre-Chorus]
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd?
'Cause I don't ever wanna, I don't ever wanna be

[Chorus]
You, don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Bridge]
Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with yourself again

[Guitar Solo]

[Breakdown]
You, don't wanna be just like you!
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you (Be just like you!)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Y'all got to feel me, sing if you're with me

391,2003,Phil Collins,Can't Stop Loving You,"[Verse 1]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time, I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway track
And when I hear that whistle blow
I'll walk away and you won't know
That I'll be crying
[Chorus]
'Cause I can't stop loving you
No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Bridge]
(Even try) I'll always be here by your side
(Why, why, why) I never wanted to say goodbye
(Why even try) I'm always here if you change, change your mind

So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

No, I can't stop loving you
No, I won't stop loving you

Can't stop me now, I've just begun
Don't even think about it
There ain't no way about it
I'm taking names, the ones of mine
Yes I'm going to take my turn
It's time for me to finally stand alone, stand alone

Flipside and she my baby mama
Get wild, okay
Freeway got the hood on smash
Pop in tape, step on gas and get ghost nigga
Freeway got the club on lock, step on stage
Set it down leave with a broad, check for her age
Post up, fans suffer circle the block
Call the cops, it's the Roc in your area
Post up, distribute to the block
Freeway move the rocks in your area
Yeah, Pop tried to shut me down
Cops tried to shut me down, haters wanna hit me up
What? My Glock carry heavy rounds
Mack carry heavy rounds packed in the Chevy truck
What? You better ring the alarm
Before I cock back, dump on you and your boys
And have black suits, tucked on you and your mom
But back to the song, said she wanna suck on me and the boys
Her ass look good in a thong
And she want me to sneak
In the building like Trojans in Troy
Best believe there's Trojans involved
Hats lift over the boy, oh boy
We rip crowds, whole lot of fire and a little bit of bass
Is all it takes to make the place
Get wild, whole lot of style and a little bit of cake
Is all it takes to make her skate

Get wild park keys and a little bit of cheese

With ease then breathe

I'm talkin' owe Sparks five, ride for a dollar bill
Famous up in Hollywood, high in them Holly-hills

Higher than the cable bill, slide with your baby girl

I got a mack that'll change your day
Fall back, get your act intact

And yes, this is Philly, you welcome to come check us

Now how many hoes in your motherfuckin group?
Wanna take a ride in my '89 Delk
She felt the kid, thumbtack, held the roof
Up on her cell phone, ""Freeway got me in the squadder
He a rider, from the block to the booth""
I'm as, real as they come, the gorillas'll come
Six could chill 'til they come, gotta peel when they done
But let her spend the night, all night
'Cuz the heat call me a liar
She just like 'Honey' so I called her Mariah
Wanna see, if she got what it takes to carry across state
And travel across state, with things taped to her waist
Mami wanna ride with pa
Bad bitches get scooped like Haagan Daas
And put on the team shoot, put on the Bean bitch
Lean bitch, shoot at they entourage
Hit up the team camp, pull on your jeans bitch

I feel like this... is comin' to an end
And it's better for me to... let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you

I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (Gotta let it burn, oh), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over (Know it's over), we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, ooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can you feel me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know, gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her bein' with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn (Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn"

Hold up, let me answer my phone. Some bitch callin' me about some bullshit probably. I'mma call you right back, I'm doin' this mixtape right now. Now back to what I was sayin'...

[Verse 1: Mario Winans]
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

[Verse 2: Mario Winans]
Oh baby
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby keep it to yourself

[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
[Bridge: Mario Winans]
Did he touch you better than me? (Touch you better then me)
Did he watch you fall asleep? (Watch you fall asleep)
Did you show him all those things, that you used to do to me (Do to me baby)
If you're better off that way (Better off that way)
There ain't more that I can say (More that I can say)
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me
(Stay away from me, baby)

[Verse 3: P. Diddy]
I don't wanna know where your whereabouts or how you movin'
I know when you in the house or when you cruisin'
It's been proven, my love you abusin'
I can't understand how a man got you choosin' (Yeah)
Undecided, I came and provided
My undivided, you came and denied it (Why?)
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin' (I know when you lyin')
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin' (Stop cryin')
I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go (I don't wanna let you go)
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe
Gave you extra cheese (C'mon), put you in the SUV
You wanted ice so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies (That's right)
Now it's time you invest in me
Cause if not then it's best you leave
Holla, yeah
[Chorus: Mario Winans]
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin', please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know"

I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears

[Verse 1: Twista]
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs, I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming, ""My, my, my, my""
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
Kick it with me, I can mold your life
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
I can make you a celebrity overnight

You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath

I'ma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags

Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
I wanna be your lover and your confidant
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
If you want the style, you can get ya girl
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And I bet she gon' put a hurt on 'em hard in the party
And you know you kill 'em in the club we go
You was born to be a pro, how you know who's taking photos
And I love you cause you freaky with the door closed
Drop it to the flo', let that go when you roll slow
And I love it when I hit it from the back
And you get on top of me and have a brother going ""Oh-oh""
Girl I love how you roll me right
I can make you a celebrity overnight

You see, see baby girl
You see how you make a brother break down

What you need from me? Oh you wanna be a star?

You've got all the finest things
Let me be your manager

Come here girl, I could see you bored
Tell you you're the queen that I see you for

406,2004,Maroon 5,This Love,"[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh
[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore"

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before but that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

[Verse 2]
Some people search for a fountain
That promises forever young (Ya know)
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
[Pre-Chorus]
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be?
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

[Chorus]
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothin' at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothin'
If I ain't got you, yeah

Said nothin' in this whole wide world don't mean a thing

Watch this

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do
But to give you part two of my confessions

[Verse 1]
Now, this gon' be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do
Got me talking to myself, asking how I'm gon' tell you
'Bout that chick on part one I told y'all I was creepin' with, creepin' with
Said she's three months pregnant and she's keepin' it
The first thing that came to mind was you
Second thing was how do I know if it's mine and is it true?
Third thing was me wishing that I never did what I did
How I ain't ready for no kid and bye bye to our relationship

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say (Oh, oh)
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Yeah, yeah)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do (No)
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions (This is part two)
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (Tell it all)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (I don't know, I don't know)
But to give you part two of my confessions
[Verse 2]
Sitting here, stuck on stupid, tryin' to figure out
When, what, and how I'ma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with, over with
I'm riding in my whip, racin' to her place
Talking to myself, preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't wanna come near me
I said, ""One second, baby, please hear me""

[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way (Chick on the side, oh I)
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed (So gone, so gone) and I don't know what to do
(What to do) I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call (Cried, when I got it)
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do (Didn't know what to do)
But to give you part two of my confessions (But I need to tell you, baby)

[Interlude]
This by far is the hardest thing I think I've ever had to do
To tell you, the woman I love
That I'm havin' a baby by a woman that I barely even know
I hope you can accept the fact that I'm man enough to tell you this
And hopefully you'll give me another chance
This ain't about my career
This ain't about my life
It's about us
Please
[Chorus]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man, I'm throwed and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give you part two of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it, then I gotta tell it all (All)
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed, I don't know what to do

W boom boom beat
The radio station that plays all the new hip hop and R&B
That was the new ""Freek-A-Leek"" by Petey Pablo
Something to put a little razzle to your dazzle
A little pimp in your step
We gonna keep it going and we're gonna play another one of the songs off of the album
This one right here, one of my personal favorites
Featuring Young Buck from G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!"
410,2004,Kanye West Featuring Syleena Johnson,All Falls Down,"[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Uh, Chi-Town, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh, when it all

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, ""Fuck it, I'll just stay down hurr and do hair""
'Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, 'cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off, now she look like Eve
And she be dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this
Just to be like, ""Nigga, you ain't up on this""
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean and a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, come on
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
And when it all falls down
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
I say, ""Fuck the police,"" that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', ""Where the ballers at?""
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And the white man get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
'Cause fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
‘Cause I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it

[Chorus: Syleena Johnson & Kanye West]
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
C'mon, c'mon
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
C'mon c'mon, and when it falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside, Southside
We gon' set this party off right
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Westside, Westside
We gon' set this party off right
Oh when it all, it all falls down
Chi-Town, Chi-Town
We gon' show 'em how we get down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now, Syleena, you just like a safe belt, you saved my life
C'mon
Oh when it all, it all falls down
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't want to get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)

Teen drinking is very bad
Yo, I got a fake ID though
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, two step with me, two step with me

[Verse 1]
One, here comes the two to the three to the four
Everybody drunk out on the dance floor
Baby girl ass jiggle like she want more
Like she a groupie and I ain't even on tour
Maybe 'cause she heard that I rhyme hardcore
Or maybe 'cause she heard that I buy out the stores
Bottom of the ninth and a nigga gotta score
If not I gotta move on to the next whore
Here comes the three to the two to the one
Homeboy trippin', he don't know I got a gun
When it come to pop, man, we do shit for fun
You ain't got one? Nigga, you better run
Now I'm in the back gettin' head from my hun
While she goin' down, I'm braggin' on what I done
She smokin' my blunt sayin' she ain't havin' fun
Bitch, give it back, now you don't get none

[Chorus]
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

[Verse 2]
Two, here comes the three to the four to the five
Now I'm lookin' at shorty right in her eyes
Couple seconds pass, now I'm lookin' at her thighs
While she tellin' me how much she hate her guy
Say she got a kid but she got her tubes tied
Girl, you twenty-one? Girl, that's alright
I'm wonderin' if a shake comin' with them fries
If so, baby, can I get 'em super-sized?
Here comes the four to the three to the two
She started feelin' on my Johnson right out the blue
Girl, you super thick so I'm thinkin' that's cool
But instead of one life hat, I need two
Her eyes got big when she glanced at my jewels
Expression on her face like she ain't got a clue
Then she told me she don't run with the crew
You know how I do but that's just what I gotta do

Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy
(Everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy)
Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

Now, everybody in this bitch gettin' tipsy

[Verse 3]
Three, here comes the four to the five to the six
Self explanatory, I ain't gotta say I'm rich
Yes, single man, I ain't tryin' to get hitched
Liquor wasted on me, man, son of a bitch
Brushed it-it off, now I'm back to gettin' lit
With some orange juice, man, this some good ish
Homeboy trippin' 'cause I'm starin' at his chick
Now he on the sideline starin' at my clique
Here comes the five to the four to the three
Hands in the air if you cats drunk as me
Club owner said, ""Kwon put out those trees!""
Dude, I don't care, I'm a P.I.M.P.

413,2004,D12,My Band,"[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know, dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
‘Cause I'm, like, the lead singer of the band, dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me, dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 1: Eminem]
So I get off stage, right? Drop the mic
Walk up to these hot chicks, and I'm all like:
""Sup, ladies? My name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer of D12, baby""
They're all like, ""Oh my God, it's him
Becky, oh my fucking God, it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God, dude, you fucking rock
Please, Marshall, please, let me suck your cock""
Now by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my a capellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So, like every single night, they pick a fight with me
But when we fight, it's kinda like sibling rivalry
‘Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude, I just think they're tryna steal the light from me
Yesterday, Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me
‘Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife-to-be
This rock star shit is the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me, because these
[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band, my band
My band
Baby, yeah

[Refrain: Eminem & Swifty McVay]
Alright, alright, alright, give me the mic, man
Okay, dawg, give—come on
Dude!
Give me this mic!
Ow, dude!

[Verse 2: Swifty McVay & Kon Artis]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards, don't you? (Uh-huh)
ADAT? How come we don't rap on Pro Tools? (God dang)
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van (Uh-huh) and he in a tour bus (Ha)
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift, ""Oh, I thought you were Kuniva"" (Come on!)
And what the hell is wrong with our dressing room?
‘Cause our shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See, I know how to rap (Uh-huh,) it's simple, but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book (Yeah)
So I'm more intact, tryin' to get on the map
Doing jumping jacks while getting whipped on my back
[Verse 3: Kuniva, Kon Artis, & Eminem]
Look at Em's little punk ass, thinking he the shit
Yeah, I know, man, by himself, taking all the flicks
Hey, I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue?
No, I had an interview, not you two
You gon' be late for soundcheck! Man, I ain't going to soundcheck
And our mics are screwed up! And his always sound best
You know what, man? I'ma say somethin'
Ayo Em! You got somethin' to say? Man, nuttin'
I thought you was about to tell him off, man, wassup?
Man, I'ma tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up
And you ain't even back me up and we supposed to be crew
Man, I was about to talk right after you, I swear
Aww, man, whatever I swear, man!

[Chorus: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
‘Cause once I blow, they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band

[Verse 4: Proof, Eminem, & Kon Artis]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to amusement parks
How I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot?
I should cut his mic off when the music starts
(Ayo—) Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear, ""Hey, dude, I love your band!""
We ain't a band, bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
Proof, carry my bag! Bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, security in my way
Who the fuck are you? Where's Obie and Dre?
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group (Fuck D12)
Time for me to go solo and make some loot (Yeah)
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
'Til Kon Artis slipped me some crack (Take this)
""Lose Yourself"" video, I was in the back
""Superman"" video, uh, I was in the back (Hahaha)
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall, ask us some questions
Like, ""Who is D12?"" ""How we get started?""
(But what about Eminem?) Bitch, are you retarded?
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big-ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (Hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and couldn't get up
Fuck D12, I'm outta this band
I'm 'bout to start a group with The Real Roxanne

[Bridge: Eminem & Bizarre]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart
To know that you don't know my name

[Refrain: Bizarre]
Man, fuck this

[Chorus: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (Haha)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (Fuck Marshall)
‘Cause once I blow, I know that I'll be the man (Yeah)
All because I'm the new singer—

[Post-Chorus: Eminem & Bizarre]
My band, my band (Your band)
My band, my band (Our band, your band)
My band, my band (You man, you man)
My band, my band, my band (Roxanne Shanté, you lesbian)
Yeah, hey y'all, the hardest boy band in the world, D12!
[Outro: Eminem]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, woah, woah, woah
Look out for my next single, it's called ""My Salsa""
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

Your homie Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

Nigga, go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too, go and brush your shoulders off

Your boy back in the building; Brooklyn, we back on the map
Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'
I'm a hustler, homie, you a customer crony
Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

[Pre-Chorus]
These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

[Chorus]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

[Verse 2]
You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

[Chorus/Outro]
When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years

Fury
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh

(Chorus: repeat 4x)
Game over, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip, Flip

(Verse One)
Ah shit, y'all done fucked up and let me in this bitch
I'm just your average hood nigga with dreams of gettin' rich
(But you don't hear me)
My crib big like a football field (football field)
You might fuck around and think I signed a football deal
(But you don't hear me)
I take 15 minutes to drop a track (yeah)
I take half a minute to load my gat
(But you don't hear me)
I make 'em bounce all across the globe
I'm a pimp, I got your hoe takin' off her clothes
(But you don't hear me)
A franchise like a Houston Rocket (Houston Rocket)
Every eight months is when I usually drop it
(But you don't hear me)
I got the streets on lock, I like my beats with knock
You know my heat stay cocked, niggaaaaa
(Chorus)

(Verse Two)
Look, I'm a Cristal nigga and you a red-winer
You just an opening act, but I'm the headliner
(But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to ship 3 mill' off top
You got your deal off your man, I got my deal off props
(But you don't hear me)
I'm connected like Dub and Mack 10 with ice cubes in my watch
And dubs on the black Benz
(But you don't hear me)
I'm getting' paid 'cause I do all the work
It's rainy days if we don't move all our work, we go berserk
(But you don't hear me)
I'm on the block fam, in the cream drop Lam
Most of y'all cats with deals, y'all ain't hot man
(But you don't hear me)
I'm 'bout to do it again, you 'bout to lose it again
It's show and tell motherfucker, I'm a prove it again

(Chorus)
The game over, 'cause shit about to change over
It's 'bout time 'cause hip-hop need a make over
(But you don't hear me)
If most producers want to charge too much
But around my way that's how you get fucked up
(But you don't hear me)
You might think we all beats and rhymes
But way before this rap shit, nigga, the streets was mine
(But you don't hear me)
I got that hot shit, that ""Thug Life"" 'Pac shit
That get hot shit, that B.I.G. ""Ready to Die"" shit
(Chorus)"

I'm a dick thrower, her neck and her back hurting
Cut throater, have you like a brand new virgin
It's like when you get used of it then you start serving
Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get off me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy
If you loving my bark let me bury my bone
I got four or five bad married bitches at home
One of my bitches feel in love with that outside dick
That outside dick keep them hoes sick like
[Chorus: Soulja Slim]

Fine bitches if you listening, you heard me, I'm strong
If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it
[Chorus: Soulja Slim]

She working that back, I don't know how to act

Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

[Verse 3: Soulja Slim]
Slow motion, she open, I'm hoping she don't leave my dick broken
With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

[Verse 4: Juvenile]
I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed
What's it gonna take for you to come slow motion with me?
Like

Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act

She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me
Ughh! I like it like that
She working that back, I don't know how to act
Slow motion for me, slow motion for me
Slow motion for me, move in slow motion for me

Well, I ain't never been the Barbie Doll type
No, I can't swig that sweet Champagne
I'd rather drink beer all night
In a tavern
Or in a honky-tonk
Or on a four-wheel-drive tailgate
Oh, I've got posters on my wall
Of Skynyrd, Kid and Strait

[Pre-Chorus]
Some people look down on me
But I don't give a rip
I'll stand barefooted in my own front yard
With a baby on my hip

[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raisin'
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Charlie Daniels song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)
[Verse 2]
Victoria Secret
Well, their stuff's real nice
Oh, but I can buy the same damn thing
On a Wal-Mart shelf half-price
And still look sexy (Sexy)
Just as sexy as those models on TV
No, I don't need no designer tag
To make my man want me

[Pre-Chorus]
You may think I'm trashy
A little too hard core
But in my neck of the woods
I'm just the girl next door

[Chorus 2]
Hey, I'm a redneck woman
I ain't no high class broad
I'm just a product of my raising
I say ""hey, y'all"" and ""yee-haw""
And I keep my Christmas lights on
On my front porch all year long
And I know all the words to every Tanya Tucker song
So here's to all my sisters
Out there keeping it country
Let me get a big ""hell yeah"" from the redneck girls like me
Hell yeah (Hell yeah!)

My dearest son, it's almost June
I hope this letter catches up with you and finds you well
It's been dry but they're callin' for rain
And everything's the same ol' in Johnsonville
Your stubborn ol' daddy ain't said too much
But I'm sure you know he sends his love
And she goes on, In a letter from home

I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared
And our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh like there's something funny
'Bout the way I talk, when mama sends her best y'all
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 2]
My dearest love, it's almost dawn
I've been layin' here all night long
Wonderin' where you might be
I saw your mama and I showed her the ring
Man on the television said something
So I couldn't sleep
But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you
And this is me kissin' you
X's and O's in a letter from home
[Chorus 2]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
And they all laugh cause she calls me honey
But they take it hard, 'cause I don't read the good parts
I fold it up and put it in my shirt
Pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on
Letters from home

[Verse 3]
Dear son, I know I ain't written
And sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen
It occurs to me I might not have said it, so I'll say it now
Son, you make me proud

[Chorus 3]
I hold it up and show my buddies
Like we ain't scared and our boots ain't muddy
But no one laughs
'Cause ain't nothin' funny when a soldier cries
And I just wipe my eyes
I fold it up and put in my shirt pick up my gun and get back to work
And it keeps me drivin' on, waitin' on

We getting loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire, fire, fire this

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
(Right?)
Nah, I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster than the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
I'm buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your hair
Yeah, I'm riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
I'm 80's man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting wrong deals
I'm only 21, sitting on mills
[Hook: Lloyd Banks & 50 Cent]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire!

(Ugh)
If you know anything about me, then you know I'm a baller
If I don't hit the first night, I ain't gon' call her
I'm trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't sparing a quarter<
So cut the games ma, let's go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass 'round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when I'm riding through the town
Like 'em small, like 'em tall, like 'em black, like 'em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader

Notice me, take my hand
Why are we strangers when our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

[Chorus]
Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

[Verse 2]
I make believe that you are here
It's the only way I see clear
What have I done?
You seem to move uneasy

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me

I may have made it rain
Please, forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry
At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby

I see your face, you're haunting me

A hundred days have made me older

A thousand lies have made me colder

But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby

You held my hand and walked me home, I know
Why you gave me that kiss

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, yeah, now check the method
They be askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin' ""We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast""
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say only Jesus can save us
Well mama I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move
I hope
[Chorus]
(Jesus, walk)
God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus, walk with me)
The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus, walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs
(Jesus, walk with me)
I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

The only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now

And I don't think there's nothin' I can do now to right my wrongs

I wanna talk to God but I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
So long, so long

To the hustlers, killers, murderers, drug dealers, even the scrippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear ye, hear ye, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
'Cause we're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
The way Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's the way I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They say you can rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played, huh?
Well if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
Then I hope this take away from my sins
And bring the day that I'm dreamin' about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out

God show me the way because the Devil's tryna break me down

And we can make moves like a person in jail
On the low, ho

And wondering why the world has passed him by
Hoping that he's bent for more than arguments
And failed attempts to fly, fly

And whether mice or men have second tries
Maybe we've been livin with our eyes half open
Maybe we're bent and broken, broken

Which I'm sure we will
All that was there
Will be there still
I'll let it pass
And hold my tongue
And you will think
That I've moved on

I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be
I will go down with this ship
And I won't put my hands up and surrender
There will be no white flag above my door
I'm in love and always will be

Don't my baby look good in them blue jeans?
Tight on the top with a belly button ring
A little tattoo
Somewhere in between
She only shows to me

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey we're going out dancin'
She's ready tonight
So damn good-lookin' boys
It ain't even right
And when bartender
Says for the lady
What's it going to be?
I tell him man

[Chorus 1]
She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose, and
She can't stand the thought of sippin' champagne

[Chorus 2]
No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs
Somethin' with a little more edge
And a little more pain

She's my little whiskey Girl
She's my little whiskey Girl
My ragged-on-the-edges girl
Ah, but I like 'em rough

Baby got a '69 mustang
Four on the floor
And you oughta hear the pipes ring
I jump behind the wheel and it's-a-way we go

Hey, I drive too fast
But she don't care
Blue bandana
Tied all up in her hair
Just sittin' there
Singin' every song on the radio

She ain't into wine and roses
Beer just makes her turn up her nose
And, she can't stand the thought of sipping' champagne

No Cuervo Gold Margaritas
Just ain't enough good burn in tequila
She needs
Somethin' with a little more edge
And a little more pain

439,2004,Linkin Park,Numb,"[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know I may end up failing, too
But I know you were just like me
With someone disappointed in you

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I'm tired of being what you want me to be

440,2004,Montgomery Gentry,If You Ever Stop Loving Me,"My old man's backhand used to land
Hard on the side of my head
I just learned to stay out of his way
There been street fights, blue lights, long nights
With the world sittin' on my chest
It just showed me how much I can take
Hard times, bad luck
Sometimes life sucks

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop lovin' me

The bank man, the bossman, the law man
All tryin' to get their hands on me
And I ain't even done a damn thing wrong
I've been way-laid, freight trained, short changed
By bigger and badder men
And all I've got to say is ""bring it on""
Hard rain, rough roads, so my life goes

That's alright
I'm okay
It ain't nothin' but another day
But only God knows where I'd be
If you ever stop loving me
I need you
Gotta have you
In my life, by my side
Every day I'm alive
Every night that I'm breathin'
I'm needin' you

That's alright
I'm okay

Above the noise and city streets

Laying in the hammock where it's nice and breezy
Sleeping off the night before

I woke up early this morning around 4am
With the moon shining bright
As headlights on the interstate
I pulled the covers over my head
And tried to catch some sleep
But thoughts of us kept keeping me awake
Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been trying my best to get along
But that's OK
There's nothing left to say, but

[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me

[Verse 2]
I went out driving trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist
It seems the only blessing I have left to my name
Is not knowing what we could have been
What we should have been
So
[Chorus]
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me

[Bridge]
Someday I'm going to run across your mind
Don't worry, I'll be fine
I'm going to be alright
While you're sleeping with your pride
Wishing I could hold you tight
I'll be over you
And on with my life

[Chorus]
So take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Cause we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me
Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need them
Take your space and all your reasons
But you'll think of me
And take your cat and leave my sweater
Because we have nothing left to weather
In fact I'll feel a whole lot better
But you'll think of me, you'll think of me, oh

That you're here tonight

I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic?

Welcome back..

Weclome back (Oh! Oh!)
Yeah man, how you doin' (Come on, come on, come on)
You good? I know you like that (Yeah you good, you doin' good)
I know you like that (Oh!)
How long you been back man?
Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome back

[Verse 1: Ma$e]
I see the girls in the club, they gettin' wild for me
And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me
These rap cats man they all got they style from me
And if I ever seen them then they probably bow to me
And when this beat - drop I know they gon' lean
World debut, I know they gon' fiend
Everything, Mississippi to the Palm Springs
Girls from brunettes down to blonde queens
These young boys don't know what a don mean
I'm just a bad boy gone clean
I'm the diamond chain choker, always remain sober
Don't drink liquor and all the games over
Need a plane, I explain it to my broker
Three bots in the hood top down, it ain't nova (My homie)
You know there's more man where that come from
Me and Kunta Love rollin' back to back in one
[Hook]
See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ooh you know we need ya, ooh you know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya
Welcome back..
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
See I rep the most high, still I'm the most fly
Win so much, they wanna know who I'm coached by
Everyday approached by chicks when I was on top
Wanna give me sosa, but I'm like don't try
I see the hisses and the disses when I go by
But see the misses on my wristses when I float by
Self control, and I can't tell you no lie
Tryin' to find a soulmate, you end up being so tired
I make my money man without the coca
Livin' the vida without the loca
I'm down south so they show me country love
And I ain't even country thug
The people give me daps and hugs, so it must be love
And I love the country grub
It feel good to hear people singing welcome back
And I ain't even sellin' the track, cause I'm that Harlem cat
[Hook x2]
See the names have all changed since I been around
But the game ain't the same since I left out
Ooh you know we need ya, ooh you know we need ya
Right here's where we need ya, right here's where we need ya
Welcome back..
Welcome back, welcome back, Betha's back (You know you like that)
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)
You know you like that

You know you like that
Welcome back, welcome back, Harlem's back (You know you like that)"

Every night it's the same
I hear you calling my name
You're lying next to me
I give into your charms
You disappear in my arms
I realize it's just a dream, but

[Chorus]
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Verse 2]
And now I
Shake the sleep from my head
And try to crawl out of bed
Today is just another day
I make the coffee for one
I turn the radio on
Pretend that everything's ok, but

[Chorus]
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Bridge]
And now I
Know there's no reason to smile
It's gonna take me awhile
'Cause I still love you desperately
[Chorus]
Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

[Verse 3]
And now I
Watch the sun going down
There ain't nobody around
I feel a night in the breeze
I keep on telling myself
I don't need nobody else
And I can do as I please, but

And now I

Desperately, I long to feel your touch
But you left me all alone in love

Uh, Fabolous: F-A-B
Poli Paul
Spen Cow, baby

[Verse 1: Christina Milian]
Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you?
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
[Verse 2: Christina Milian]
You're gettin' bold, it’s growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
Then you're thinkin' of leavin', but give it time
It's late at night, he's comin' home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know it's on
If you understand me, ya'll, come on

All my ladies wind it up if you know just how to move (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Yeah, uh
Yeah, uh
Baby girl, the way you pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I might stop to shop and cop you things
You know I drop the top and hop that thang
Sometimes I stop my bop to pop my thing
You sure know how to make a man say, ""Oh""
And how in the world can a man say, ""No""
When you grind it up on the wall, wind it up like a doll
And you know I Bacardi, lime it up till you fall
Line it up 'till you spoiled
And have those other chicks throwin' vomit up
When they can't find it up in the mall
Like most men, I love to catch up with a model
But I ain't used to movin' slow like ketchup in a bottle
And the best things come to those who wait for it
But I'mma be straight for before it's too late for it
I want you to dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out and make me say, ""Oh""

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Slow)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang (Yeah)
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh"" (Oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow (You can)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop-t, pop-t, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, ""Oh""
Dip it low, pick it up slow (Oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out (Oh) let your back go

454,2004,JAY-Z,99 Problems,"[Produced by Rick Rubin]
[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

You crazy for this one, Rick

What'd ya hear this time?
Go on and speak your mind
I know somebody's lyin'
It's always somethin'
Her auntie told your cousin
Then all your homies jumped in
And now, the whole hood's buzzin'
When he say, she say
Don't let it get in your head
Baby, don't say something that you will regret
I'm on your team
It's us against them, you'll see
And we ain't gon' stop
They just want what we got

[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Hey-yeah)
How can they talk about our love (They don't know)
When they don't know one thing about us? (No, no)
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out

[Verse 2: Brandy]
I swear, they got some nerve
Spreadin' what they heard
I can't give them no burn
I can't be concerned with all that talk
I won't be involved, that's my word
See, I'm not the one
They got me confused
They got me messed up
Don't you think I've had enough?
When it comes to what we do
All that matters is us two
Don't pay them no mind
We just gon' show and prove
[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love (Hey, yeah-eah)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Baby)
How can they talk about our love (Why you talkin' about me?)
When they don't know one thing about us?
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out (Kanye)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Uh, it's a couple of things I can't honor, man
How you listen to a girl that still want a man?
Tell me the truth, is that a man or Juwanna Mann?
I'm wonderin', why she ""ret ta go"" like Wanda then?
When we met you was a V like Madonna, man
Now you in the field, runnin' plays like Donovan
McNabb, before you get in a cab
I traded my cash, just to take it back to last summer, man
You don't remember when you was my sweetest?
You don't remember I called you Reese's Pieces?
'Cause it's no wrong way to do you know what
She turned around, giggled, said ""You so nuts!""
But nowadays, we actin' way too grown up
Like, ""how ya ex-girl get that new number?""
The rumors was so numerous
For stickin' by me, I had to give you two thumbs up
And that's why
[Chorus: Brandy]
The more they talk about our love
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious
How can they talk about our love (People shouldn't talk about our love)
When they don't know one thing about us? (No)
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths (Whoo)
So, all we do is tune them out (Go on, oh-oh)
The more they talk about our love (Tune it out, baby)
The more they make it obvious
The more they seem so envious (Whoo-whoo, ay)
How can they talk about our love (Let's not talk about it, baby)
When they don't know one thing about us?
Instead, they just runnin' their mouths
So, all we do is tune them out (I don't wanna hear it no more)"

All we need's a little salt & lime
We can plug in the hot pepper lights and pretend

I can run to the store and get some charcoal
Buy a tiki torch and fire up the grill
The whole town wants to know when I'm gonna grow up
But you know I never will

Yeah I might be a little bit loco
But it keeps me from losin' my mind
Oh but half insane that's ok
Babe a little bit crazy's alright

Nothin' wrong with a little excitement
No it makes me forget about work
'Cause I live by the rule that everything's cool
Just as long as nobody gets hurt
Hey I feel like I'm on vacation
Honey you say the word and we'll go

Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things

(No, no turning back, now)
The very worst part of you is me

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this, again
So, I pretended up a person who was fitting in

I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello, there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim
Of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night, we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on, so haunting every time
And as I stare, I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already

Oh, I didn't ask to go with you to Mexico
I really didn't need the shopping spree in LA or Melrose
Boy, if you didn't know it, well, now you know
I didn't need the furs or the jewelry
Because material things, it don't mean much to me

I've been holdin' us down, on my own and no

He was sittin' there, his brush in hand
Painting waves as they danced, upon the sand
With every stroke, he brought to life
The deep blue of the ocean, against the mornin' sky
I asked him if he only painted ocean scenes
He said for twenty dollars, I'll paint you anything

[Chorus]
Could you paint me a Birmingham?
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while, she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

[Verse 2]
He looked at me, with knowing eyes
Then took a canvas from a bag there by his side
Picked up a brush, and said to me
Son, just where in this picture would you like to be
And I said if there's any way you can
Could you paint me back into her arms again?
[Chorus]
Could you paint me a Birmingham?
Make it look just the way I planned
A little house on the edge of town
Porch goin' all the way around
Put her there in the front yard swing
Cotton dress make it, early spring
For a while, she'll be mine again
If you could paint me a Birmingham

Paint me a Birmingham
Make it look just the way I planned

Yeah, yo, I'm the nigga with the perpetual oyster bars
Mother of pearl delivery, voice of God
And it's hard just being the boss
Being I can't go to jail 'cause them years will cost me
Don't get me wrong, lay a nigga down if he force me
Rather just sit back and roll a dutch
Think about how I'ma put the game in the cobra clutch
Think about how I'ma get the 'caine over Customs
Never underestimate niggas or over trust them
Uh, yeah, them M's is right in my face
I just got to throw my Timbs on and tighten my lace
If it don't jam, the TEC will spray
When I spit everybody gotta split like pepper spray
'Cause I'm a nigga that hate to settle
And I'm a man of the Lord but I still can't shake the devil
Moved away and still can't escape the ghetto, what?!

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder
A gun, a knife, a bat, a brick, anything I can get my hands on
Call my bluff, start acting up, and I'll leave you underground

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I know how to get my peers off me
They can cry and die from high blood pressure 'cause tears are salty
It's a symptom if you bobbing your head
You know that he's sick
You know the flow is ridic', now throw him a grip
When I get it, you already know I'm throwing them bricks
Putting purple everywhere, daddy, I'm throwing them nicks
That's right, homie, you can't move me
I ain't going nowhere, I'm in the hood like bootleg movies
All you shooting is the breeze, a bootleg Uzi
I'm just waiting on a q like Suzie, don't lose me
These penitentiary chances that I take
Should be able to get the mansion by the lake
But I invest my bread into something else
Into something else that'll make something melt
You just got to feel the kid
If not rap for the fact of how real he is, what up
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
The time to talk is up
So bring the heat, playtime is over
While you running your mouth I'm creeping up over your shoulder

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Ayo, niggas know the champ is in here
He took it from crack to rap, now he put out two anthems a year
And I just want to rock for a century
And then chase the book with the documentary
If you, can't do nothing other than flow
Life's a bitch like the mother from Blow, let's go
Don't make me put your heart in your lap
Fuck riding the beat, nigga, I parallel park on the track
Hop out looking crispy, fresh and new
In the six, but it's a BM, and it's Pepsi blue
And, I don't know you
But I know a man becomes a man from all the shit that he go through
Y'all ain't fuckin with Jason
After I cash in, there's really no justification
Of how I'm gonna change the game, so don't get out of line
'Cause this little nine will change your frame, what up

The time to talk is up

475,2004,Alanis Morissette,Everything,"[Verse 1]
I can be an asshole of the grandest kind
I can withhold like it's going out of style
I can be the moodiest, baby and you've never met anyone
Who's as negative as I am sometimes

[Verse 2]
I am the wisest woman you've ever met
I am the kindest soul with whom you've connected
I have the bravest heart that you've ever seen and you've never met anyone
Who's as positive as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

[Verse 3]
I blame everyone else, not my own partaking
My passive aggressiveness can be devastating
I'm terrified and mistrusting and you've never met anyone
Who's as closed down as I am sometimes

[Chorus]
You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

What I resist persists and speaks louder than I know
What I resist you love, no matter how low or high I go

[Verse 4]
I am the funniest woman that you've ever known
I am the dullest woman that you've ever known
I'm the most gorgeous woman that you've ever known and you've never met anyone
Who's as everything as I am sometimes

You see everything, you see every part
You see all my light and you love my dark
You dig everything of which I'm ashamed
There's not anything to which you can't relate
And you're still here

Oh, what'ch'you...what are you sayin?

[Verse 1: MCA]
All you Trekkies and TV addicts
Don't mean to diss, don't mean to bring static
All you Klingons in the fucking house
Grab your backstreet friend and get loud
Blowin' doors off hinges
I'll grab you with the pinchers
And no, I didn't retire
I'll snatch you up with a needle nose pliers

[Verse 2: Mike D]
Like Mutual of Omaha
Got the ill boat you've never seen before
Glidin' in the glades
And like Lorne Greene, you know I get paid
Like caprese and with the basil
Not goofy like Darren or Hazel
I'm a motherfuckin' Nick at Night
With classics rerunning that you know all right

[Verse 3: Ad Rock]
Now remain calm, no alarm
'Cause my farm ain't fat
So what's up with that?
I've got friends and family that I respect
When I think I'm too good, they put me in check
So believe when I say I'm no better than you
Except when I rap, so I guess it ain't true
Like that, y'all, and you just don't stop
Guaranteed to make your body rock
[Chorus]
Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about
Work-wa-work-work-work-wa-work it out
Let's turn this muthafucking party out

[Verse 4: Mike D]
I said, ""Doc, what's the condition?
I'm a man that's on a mission""
He said, ""Son, you'd better listen
Stuck in your ass is an electrician""
Like a scientist
Mmm, when I'm applying this
Method of controlling my mind
Like Einstein and the Rapping Duke combined

[Verse 5: Ad Rock]
Now, hey, baby bubba, now what's the deal?
I didn't know you go for that mass appeal
Some call it salugi, some hot potato
I stole your mic, but you won't see it later
'Cause I work magic like a magician
I add up, the mathematician
I'm a bank cashier, engineer
I wear cotton and I don't wear sheer
[Verse 6: MCA]
Shazam and abracadabra
In the whip, I'm gonna cruise past ya
Yo, money, don't chump yourself
Put that shit back on the shelf
Light rays blazing, you're out of phase, and my crew's amazing
We're working on the record, yo, so just stay patient

Check-ch-check-check-check-ch-check it out
What-wha-what-what-what's it all about

Now, I go by the name of the King Ad-Rock
I don't wear a cup nor a jock
I bring the shit that's beyond bizarre
Like Miss Piggy (Who, moi?)
I am the one with the clientele
You say, ""Ad-Rock, you rock so well""
I've got class like pink champale
MCA, grab the mic before the mic goes stale
[Verse 8: MCA]
Don't test me, they can't arrest me
I'll fake right, cross-over and shoot lefty
You look upset, yo, calm down
You look like Cable Guy dunked off of your crown
I flow like smoke out a chimney
You never been me
You wanna rap but what you're making ain't hip-hop, B

[Verse 9: Mike D]
Get your clothes right out the dryer
Put Armor All up on your tire
Sport that fresssssh attire
Tonight we goin' out, set the town on fire
Set the town ablaze
Gonna stun and amaze
Ready to throw a craze
Make your granny shake her head and say ""those were the days""

[Chorus]

Catch me in the club with a double edge banger

Nah I know the promoters I'm in with the musket
Pound of that haze and a box of Dutches

A little blood get on my daughter, it's nothing, she'll live
Got cops shook to death of us...we don't like D's

Oh, no, no, no

[Verse 1]
Hope life's been good to you
Since you've been gone
I'm doing fine now — I've finally moved on
It's not so bad — I'm not that sad
I'm not surprised just how well I survived
I'm over the worst, and I feel so alive
I can't complain — I'm free again

And it only hurts when I'm breathing
My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming
So, I hold my breath — to forget

Don't think I'm lyin' 'round, cryin' at night
There's no need to worry, I'm really alright
I've never looked back — as a matter of fact

My heart only breaks when it's beating
My dreams only die when I'm dreaming

Erwin Nichols there
With Judsley playin checkers at the gin
When I dream about the Southland
This is where it all begins

Sleepy sweet home Alabama
Roll Tide Roll

Muddy water Mississippi
Blessed Graceland whispers to me
Carry on, carry on
Sweet Southern comfort, carry on

Catching catfish on the river
Chasing fireflies by the creek
Kissing Gabby Williams' sister
On the porch homecoming week
With rusted cars and weeping willows
Keeping watch out in the yard
Just a snapshot of downhome Dixie
Could be anywhere you are

In Carolina or in Georgia
Open arms are waiting for you
Louisiana
Yellow Rose of San Antone

Arkansas
Mississippi
Old man river whispers to me
Carry on, carry on

I'm surrounded by these priceless memories
I don't have to think about it
There's no place I'd rather be

Now what we came here to do
It means more to me than just a night
That we'll share so make sure that you're prepared
Baby and know that love is not just something to do
It's the moment that transcends
Our physical into a more spiritual level of understanding

[Chorus]
And who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions
And lose ourselves inside a world made for us and no one else
Hey girl just let me love you

[Verse 2]
Now ain't no need to be afraid
Cause I'll be as gentle as it takes
To provide you with the right amount of pleasure and pain
And I'll make sure that you feel alright
Even if it takes me all night cause the joy is all mine
Now when I know you're satisfied
So let's keep giving all we got

Who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go

Who knows somehow this night just might lead us
Into a place where our emotions can grow if we let them go
Cause who knows what may happen if we act on our attractions

All the way to New Orleans where the girls cook catfish
And in L.A., every chick's an actress
Hollywood status with the shaded glasses
To Detroit, yeah the place that I rest
Where the ladies got ass and symbolize sex
And hot Atlanta, y'all is one of the best
Where they speak Southern slang and smoke la cess
And New York, women are way too fresh
Too much on your mind, let me ease that stress
I wish you all were mine, it's so selfish
Maybe I'm feeling myself too much, I guess
But, to my ladies all across the globe
In small towns that I don't even know
To all local international codes
Whether you see me in streets or catch me at shows

He said, ""Ye, you know you got extra hoes
And everything you do is extra cold""
From the Polo fleece to the Jesus piece
I got family in high places like Jesus' niece
Can I please, say my peace?
If y'all fresh to death, then I'm deceased
And this one here is a heatrocks, spit like a beat box
The way the beat rocks, new version of Pete Rock

Hope he feels better, and thanks Jonetta from Cleveland

Make sure you cop some trees to spark up

You sealed with a kiss and you sent it with Chanel
You looking good in that one showing off your body
Had a Beverly Hills mami that would buy me Cartis
Take me to afterparties, her name was Khari
And it sucks that we didn't keep in touch, I'm sorry
But, hey Kim, how's Minneapolis?
You so pretty, hate you show off your titties for silly classes
Cause I love you girls, though you ain't mine

Picking up on the signals sent back from within
Sometimes it feels like I don't really know what's goin' on
Time and time again it seems like everything is wrong in here
[Pre-Chorus]
But there's still tomorrow
Forget the sorrow
And I can be on the last train home
Watch it pass the day
As it fades away
No more time to care
No more time today

[Chorus]
But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

[Bridge]
But we sing if we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing if it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to ever fall in love

[Chorus]
But we sing
If we're going nowhere
Yeah, we sing
If it's not enough
And we sing
Sing without a reason to never fall in love
To never fall in love again
(To never fall in love again)
(To never fall in love again)"

I like your pants around your feet
And I like the dirt that's on your knees
And I like the way you still say please
While you're looking up at me
You're like my favourite damn disease

[Verse 2]
And I love the places that we go
And I love the people that you know
And I love the way you can't say no
Too many long lines in a row
I love the powder on your nose

[Chorus]
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)

[Verse 3]
I like the freckles on your chest
And I like the way you like me best
And I like the way you're not impressed
While you put me to the test
I like the white stains on your dress
[Verse 4]
And I love the way you pass the check
And I love the good times that you wreck
And I love your lack of self-respect
While you're passed out on the deck
I love my hands around your neck

[Chorus]
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out
(Now I did, you wonder why)
And now I know who you are
It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out

And I hate the people that you know

497,2004,G-Unit Featuring Joe,Wanna Get To Know You,"[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 1: Young Buck]
I'm loving how you look in my eyes, swanging them hips when you pass
I'm visualizing my name tattooed on that ass, baby
Jump on this Harley, let's go smoke some of that Bob Marley
Sip some Bacardi then go pull up at the after party
I think we make a perfect couple, but you think I'm trouble
Maybe that's the reason you gave me the wrong number (what?)
She got me feeling like, maybe she the wrong woman
Think I'ma be chasing a chickenhead, you're on something
Your toes painted, hair fixed all the time
And your Gucci boots the same color as mine
If you read between the lines you can see that I want you
I betcha I'll have you doing what you said that you won't do
Make a decision shorty, good things don't last long
Your girlfriend keeps showing me that thong
Before I head home I'ma stop at your house and blow the horn
If you come outside you know it's on, holla at your boy
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Lately she's been frustrated with the baller, wonder why I don't call her
Maybe because I'm busy and she need someone to spoil her
It gets annoying, from time to time I gotta ignore her
In order to let her know that we friends and nutting more
She loves it when I'm in town, hate it when I'm not around
I get her and wear her down, next door neighbors hear the sound
Pictures hitting the ground, just enough to hold us down
I'm sticking and moving, cruising after the third round
Just lay back baby and let me drive you crazy
I can make a forty-year old feel like a young lady
I admit I fell in love with her frame
And to make her feel special I let her call my by my government name
Her panties wet over fame, fell in love with my chain
I wonder if I wasn't an entertainer, would she remain?
Surrounding me, hounding me, trying to be my ON-LY
I'm not your boyfriend, I'm your HO-MIE
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Yeah..
Don't know what fuck me up more: watching her lick her lips
Or watching her walk, she hypnotized me with her hips, man
I sweet talk her if she like
'Cause all she really want is a nigga to treat her right, right?
Look, I'm legit now, I used to break laws
Now you can reap the benefits of world tours (wooo!)
Big house, big Benz - girl it's yours
Mink coats, Italian shoes, stones with no flaws
You ain't got to look like a model for me to adore you
All you gotta do is love me and be loyal
Don't indulge in my past, fuck what happened before you
'Cause it means somebody's gon' hate you that never saw you
Come here, let me touch on you, I let you touch on me
Put my tongue on you, you put your tongue on me
Let me ride on you, and you can ride on
We can do it all tonight, we can have a ball tonight
[Chorus: Joe]
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy
I wanna get to know ya
I really wanna fuck you, baby
One dose of your loving
I know it gon' drive me, crazy
I wanna be your lover
I wanna get to know you, baby
One dose of my loving
I know it gon' drive you, crazy

Better listen when I talk nigga, don't trip
Yo' heat in the car, mines in this bitch

Eyes a little low cause I twist the 'dro
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's

Come get your bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Not Captain c'mon and Save-a-Ho
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart all the time mane
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt
But shorty shake that thang like a pro man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh man""
I got close enough to her so I know she could hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear

Now I can't breathe
No, I can't sleep
I'm barely hangin' on

Broken up, deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry

I told you everything
Opened up and let you in

Can't deny it, can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up, deep inside

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me"

First one in, last one out the club
Bursting in, passing out in the club
Back at it, this cat is the wit and the charm
Taking you higher like a syringe hittin ya arm
Bringing the fire, making you Benz ring the alarm

Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down, because I want it all
It started out with a kiss, how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his

Chest now, he takes off her
Dress now, let me go
And I just can't look, it's killing me
They're taking control

Swimming through sick lullabies, choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I pay, destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes, 'cause I'm Mr. Brightside

Can you swear to me that you'll always be this way
Show me how you feel

Could've sworn I was dreamin'

Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit

It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'

Ladies, let's go (Uhh), soldiers, let's go (Dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just, you know
Give you a little situation... listen (Fellas)

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes & The Pussycat Dolls]
You see this shit get hot, every time I come through
When I step up in the spot (Are you ready?)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick, yes, I'm on the lookout (Let's dance)
Slow bangin' shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (Ooh, baby)
No tricks, only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme the number, but make sure you call before you leave

[Verse 2: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around, she's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (It's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be (ah) with me (Ahh)
[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me?
Don't cha? Don't cha?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me?
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me?
Don't cha? (Ah-ah-ah) Don't cha?

[Verse 3: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
Fight the feeling (Fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (Leave it alone)
'Cause if it ain't love
It just ain't enough to leave a happy home (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
Let's keep it friendly (Let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (You have to play fair, yeah)
See, I don't care
But I know, she ain't gon' wanna share (Ah, ah-ah)

[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls & Busta Rhymes]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)

Seem like shorty wanna little ménage pop off or somethin'
Let's go)
[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
Well, let me get straight to it
Every broad wanna watch a nigga when I come through it
It's the God almighty, lookin' all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my Aston Vanquish
Lookin' at me all like she really wanna do it
Tryna put it on me 'til my balls black and blueish
You wanna play with a player, girl, then play on
Strip out the Chanel and leave the lingerie on (Ha)
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin' at you wanna break my back
You're the very reason why I keep a pack of the Magnum
And with the wagon, hit you in the back of the Magnum
For the record, don't think it was something you did
Shorty all on me 'cause it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cold so I could hit the both of y'all

[Verse 5: The Pussycat Dolls & Cee-Lo Green]
See, I know she loves ya (I know she loves ya)
I understand (I understand, yeah)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you if you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (Maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (Possibly)
Until then, old friend, your secret is safe with me (Shhh... hot)
[Chorus: The Pussycat Dolls]
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me? (Oh)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me? (Like me)
Don't cha? Don't cha, baby?
Don't cha? Alright, sing
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was raw like me? (Raw)
Don't cha wish your girlfriend was fun like me? (Big fun)

How long before I get in?
Before it starts, before I begin?
How long before you decide?
Before I know what it feels like?
Where to, where do I go?
If you never try, then you'll never know
How long do I have to climb
Up on the side of this mountain of mine?

[Verse 2]
Look up, I look up at night
Planets are moving at the speed of light
Climb up, up in the trees
Every chance that you get
Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
[Verse 3]
Ideas that you'll never find
All the inventors could never design
The buildings that you put up
Japan and China all lit up
The sign that I couldn't read
Or a light that I couldn't see
Some things you have to believe
But others are puzzles, puzzling me

[Hook]
All that noise, and all that sound
All those places I got found
And birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand

Ah when you see it then you'll understand

[Bridge]
All those signs, I knew what they meant
Some things you can invent
Some get made, and some get sent

Birds go flying at the speed of sound
To show you how it all began
Birds came flying from the underground
If you could see it then you'd understand
Ah, when you see it then you'll understand"

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwed as me

Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they? I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket

Look at all those movie stars

When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between

I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing

I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But it's home to me, and I walk alone

Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's all right
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind me that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 1]
Drunk and I'm feeling down
And I just wanna be alone
I'm pissed cause you came around
Why don't you just go home
'Cause you channel all your pain
And I can't help you fix yourself
You're making me insane
All I can say is

[Chorus]
I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And our scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

[Verse 2]
I tried to help you once
Against my own advice
I saw you going down
But you never realized
That you're drowning in the water
So I offered you my hand
Compassions in my nature
Tonight is our last stand

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind us that the past is real
I tear my heart open just to feel

I’m drunk and I’m feeling down
And I just want to be alone
You shouldn’t have come around
Why don’t you just go home
'Cause you’re drowning in the water
And I tried to grab your hand
I left my heart open
But you didn’t understand
(But you didn’t understand)
Go fix yourself!

[Bridge]
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I got to move on with my own life
I can't help you fix yourself
But at least I can say I tried
I'm sorry but I got to move on with my own life

I tear my heart open, I sew myself shut
My weakness is that I care too much
And my scars remind us that the past is real

Yo, Frankie J, obsession

[Verse 1: Frankie J]
Well, it's early in the morning
And my heart is feeling lonely
Just thinkin' 'bout you, baby
Got me twisted in the head
And I don't know how to take it
But it's driving me so crazy
I don't know if it's right
I'm tossin' turning in my bed

[Pre-Chorus: Frankie J]
It's five o'clock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin' 'bout your beauty, it makes me weak
I'm feeling hopeless in my home
I don't know what to do
I think I'm in love, baby

[Chorus: Frankie J]
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Then what am I feeling? (Then what am I feeling?)
What am I doing wrong?
Amor, no es amor (If this ain't love)
Is this an illusion (Is this an illusion) that I have in my heart?
[Verse 2: Frankie J]
Now, I know you're not my lady
But I'm just tryna make this right
I don't know what to do, I'm goin' out of my mind
So baby, if you let me
Kick it witchu, well, then maybe
We could ride together, we could do this all night
Now I don't care if you got a man
Baby, I wish you'd understand
'Cause I know he can't love you right, quite like I can

Got a lot of money, and I love to spend it
And that's what's up, and I don't care what people scream
You're my blessin' when I'm stressin'

I'm gonna keep it saucy 'cause mama know how I do
We gon' rendezvous

In a cabin by a meadow where the wild bees swarm

And I wanna learn from your pa

And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you

Coming your way

With a warm, wet kiss
Yes, I am

Wanted to belong here

Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me, but
Gotta keep moving on, moving on
Fly away, breakaway

542,2005,R. Kelly,Trapped In The Closet,"[Verse 1: The Game]
Here the break down
Spider Loc is a joke
Nigga sound like chunk off the goonies
Ya life is a movie
You ain't a factor you a actor fifty gave you a script
Went from runnin with the bloods to a g-unit crip
What's a g-unit crip? not a gang in LA
Bang on records but nigga won't bang in LA
Why the fuck you wake me up. .. nigga I'm tired
You a busta, so I'mma light your ass on Fire
Nigga want my spot so he runnin with buck
Keep tryna play The Game, and u 'gon get fucked
I heard diss after diss, lil nigga you suck
Like yo baby mama, in the third row of my truck
Naw-vail ill whoop your ass in your own hood
You so hard why didn't u put out that song about Suge
Trapped in the closet, R. Kelly ass nigga
Get swiss cheesed up, ol' deli ass nigga
T.boz in belly ass nigga
Better ask around, I been the truth since Makaveli passed nigga
And I ain't wanna have to do this shit
I'd rather be at home listening to the Cam'ron diss
Dr. Dre said it best 'a bitch is a bitch'
You a myspace gangsta nigga suck my dick
Your flow is budweiser, mines is crystale
Put the faggot on ice he gon be there for a while
Now watch me put my chest out like 10 og's
I wore this G-unot shirt to show m.o.p
I'm gutter mutha fucka
Tell you fuck you to Fifty face, and won't st-st-stutter muthafucka
And now that I put the kids to bed
I tell you a story about a spider caught in his web
Marvel williams, a well known crip
Not cause he put in work, but cause his brother a snitch
He belong in g-unit, I'mma tell you the truth
Fifty, this nigga brother tell more than you
So I'mma break it down like an ounce of glue
I met this nigga spider at Alliyah video shoot
True, true, he had on no blue
Dmx start laughin he said 'this nigga think he better than you'
So I kicked a freestyle, and in the meanwhile
This nigga soakin up game tryna copy my style
Gave him a hundred bars, all he did was smile
And DMX named me the fuckin problem child
Now back to the future, you got a problem now
Snoopin around my hood, get fucked doggy style
I pull ya faggot ass out them g-unit sneakers
And let ya soul burn in hell on the anniversery to 'ether'
You g-unit crip, used to be a piru
Your name marvel, all you need now is a spiderman suit
Black wallstreet bitch you can't fuck wit my crew
My flow blind baby, I'mma make you do what it do
Lets take a ride Nigga I'mma make room in the coupe
Put the shovel in the truck, throw you in there too
Bitch in the passenger side, say she hear somebody screamin
Turn the music up.. baby that's comin from the speakers
She said I ain't trippin I hear somebody screamin
I had to throw her off so I start singin
I know you don't love me
You ain't the same when 50 Cent's in town
I know you don't love me
You always talkin' bout how Ma$e get down
I know you don't love me
You scream and holla when Spider Loc's around
Got me fucked up wit them g-unit crips
Tryna run game on me you punk bitch

Get yo ass in the trunk
Prodigy know that I ain't a punk
Keep these rap niggas in check like a pair of ducks
Who can flip like I do?
Spit like NaS too?
Rock a yankee fitted, still throw up piru?
Rock a dodger fitted in the middle of the bronx
I shine in any hood like paul wall fronts
Nigga my flow foolish sit back while I do this
Watch me manuever threw cedar block, and end up in hoover
I spit like a Ruger
You spit crap like a rookie dice shooter
Snake eyes to the loser
Nigga I'm grand pooba
Gave em somethin' grand nubian
Created g-unot, fifty tried to sue me and
Say he kick me out the group nigga I left
Spider, you want my spot nigga? clean up my mess
Dirty ass nigga, fifty give him a check
And if you sign, nigga put ya contract on the internet
I been bangin for 10 years, muhthafucka I been a vet
For 500 dollas he'll claim any set
Give him a 1000 dollars hell tat it on his hand... damn
That's worse than me lyin sayin olivia was a man
Ya XXL cover look like makin of the band
You mad, cause I got my own shoe
And my nigga take shots for the game like MJ do
Some say its bullshit till I pull quick
Till I empty a full clip
Get on the horn, meet me in the bullpit
Tony yayo you old ass coward
You 36 and u spit your hottest verse on my album
Now.. I ain't sayin that you dope nigga..
But you better than spider loc Nigga...
Fifty saw the opportunity and thought he could use him
I know he don't be listenin' to that wack-ass music
You got the west on your back? you a lyin bastard
You the reason niggas push mute when they play madden
What the hell made you think you could fuck wit the game
When yo claim to fame was Yukmouth's chain
Take my advice and lay low
Heard you and your uncle Yayo
Got ran the fuck outta san diego
I'll give you 5 shots when the 38 blow
Leave a hole in your chest.. the size of a bagel
We can do it when you say so
Wait till the Lakers on the road, shoot it out at the staples
Open your chest, show the world what you made of
My dick hard I can't wait till the day come
When I can put the infared on him
Let billboard rest, don't speak on my dead homie
All you new west coast niggas chill
The city is mine, Eazy left it to me in his will"
543,2005,Gavin DeGraw,Chariot,"[Verse 1]
Staring at a maple leaf
Leaning on the mother tree
I said to myself, ""We all lost touch""
Your favorite fruit is chocolate covered cherries
And seedless watermelon, oh
Nothing from the ground is good enough
Body rise
Look what's over me

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Verse 2]
Remember seeking moon's rebirth
Rains made mirrors of the earth
The sun was just yellow energy
It is a living promise land
Even over fields of sand
Seasons fill my mind and
Cover me
Bringing back
More than a memory
[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Bridge]
You'll be my vacation away from this place
You know what I want
Holding that cup
It's pouring over the sides
Make me wanna spread my arms and fly

[Chorus]
Oh chariot, your golden waves
Are walking down upon this face
Oh chariot, I'm singing out loud
To guide me
Give me your strength

[Outro]
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Chariot)
Give me your strength (Give it to me)

Give me your strength (Give it to me)

Give me your strength (Give it to me)

Take a minute girl, come sit down
And tell us what's been happening
In your face, I can see the pain
Don't you try to convince us that you're happy, yeah
We've seen this all before
Brothers taking advantage of the passion
Because we've come too far for you to feel alone
You don't let him walk over your heart, I'm telling you

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
And you needing somebody to talk to
Girl, I can tell he's been lying
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
Girl, you don't have to be hiding
Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Verse 2: Kelly]
See, what y'all don't know about him
Is I can't let him go because he needs me
It ain't really him, it's stress from his job
And I ain't making it easy
I know you see him bugging most of the time
But I know deep inside, he don't mean it
It gets hard sometimes, but I need my man
I don't think y'all understand, I'm telling you
[Chorus: Destiny's Child & Beyoncé]
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(We understand, don't be ashamed, I'm your friend)

And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you

Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?
Girl, I can tell you've been crying
(I can tell you've been crying)
And you needing somebody to talk to (I can see it in your eyes)
Girl, I can tell he's been lying (I can tell he's been lying)
And pretending that he's faithful and he loves you
(I can see it in the way you)
Girl, you don't have to be hiding

Don't you be ashamed to say he hurt you
I'm your girl, you're my girl, we your girls
Don't you know that we love ya?

[Bridge: Michelle & Destiny's Child]
Girl, take a good look at yourself
He got you going through hell

545,2005,Alicia Keys,Karma,"[Verse 1]
Weren't you the one that said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
But still you said that love was gone and that I had to leave

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, talkin' 'bout a family
Now you, saying I complete your dream
Now you, saying I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you say to me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you
Til three o'clock in the morn'
[Verse 2]
And when you came home, you'd always have some sorry excuse
And explaining to me, like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I want just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me, you never come through

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you, wanna be a part of me (Ayy)
Now you, have so much to say to me (Hey)
Now you, wanna make time for me
What you doin' to me?
You're confusing me
Don't play with me
Don't play with me

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back

[Post-Chorus]
I remember when
I was sittin' home alone
Waiting for you
Til three o'clock in the morn
[Bridge]
Night after night
Knowing something going on
Wasn't home before me
You was, you was gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy, but believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceived me
And never do what you was supposed to do
No need to approach me boo, 'cause I'm over you

[Chorus]
'Cause what goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down
Gotta stop tryin', to come back to me
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must come down

[Outro]
It's called Karma, baby
And it goes around
What goes around, comes around
What goes up, must comes down
Now who's crying, desiring to come back to me"

G's up
Yeah, yeah, come on
You know how we do

I'm the kind of brother
Who been doing it my way, getting my way for years
In my career
And every lover
In and out my life, I've hit, love and left the tears
Without a care

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Until I met this girl who turned the tables around
She caught me by surprise
I never thought I'd be the one breaking down
I can't figure it out, why...

Got me feeling it (Caught up)
I don't know what it is

Let me go, baby
Now, listen...

[Verse 2]
My mama told me
""Be careful who you do 'cause karma comes back around""
Same old song, nah
But I was so sure
That it wouldn't happen to me 'cause I know how to put it down
But I was so wrong

[Pre-Chorus 2]
This girl was mean (So mean), she really turned me out
Her body was so tight, I'm lookin' for her in the daytime with a flashlight
My homies say this girl is cramping my style

And I can't figure it out, but...

Wondering why you even put it on
I know you think you do, but baby, you don't need it
Wish that you could see what I see when it's gone

[Chorus]
I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is
A T-shirt hanging off a Dogwood Branch
That river was cold, but we gave love a chance
Yeah, yeah, for me
You don't look a day over fast cars and freedom
That sunset river bank, first time feeling

[Verse 2]
Yeah, smile and shake your head as if you don't believe me
I'll just sit right here and let you take me back
I'm on that gravel road, look at me
On my way to pick you up
You're standing on the front porch looking just like that
Remember that

I see a dust trail following an old red Nova
Baby blue eyes, your head on my shoulder
Wait, baby, don't move, right there it is

In and out of your jaws, I was beating down your walls
Had your ass breaking laws for a player was the cause
And every time you seen a G you was slipping off your drawers, I recall
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
Show your ass how to buss a nut, up in the guts

The way you played with your tongue, I knew right then I would call you
So what it is, they call me Super Don from the ville
And I'mma tell you like this, cause a nigga so real, and stay trill
Cause all I wanna do is just drill, with that ass in the air, and the pussy I kill

Be sure that you can turn me loose

551,2005,Shakira Feat. Alejandro Sanz,La Tortura,"[Letra de ""La Tortura"" ft. Alejandro Sanz]

[Intro: Alejandro Sanz]
Ay payita mia, guardate la poesia
Guardate la alegria pa' ti

[Verso 1: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No pido que todos los días sean de sol
No pido que todos los viernes sean de fiesta
Tampoco te pido que vuelvas rogando perdón
Si lloras con los ojos secos
Y hablando de ella
Ay, amor, me duele tanto (Me duele tanto)
Que te fueras sin decir a dónde
Ay, amor, fue una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adios
[Verso 2: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
No puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal
No puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras
No puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal
Y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
Ay, amor, me duele tanto, me duele tanto
Que no creas más en mis promesas
Ay, amor, es una tortura perderte

[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Pero lo puedo arreglar, amor
No sólo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón
Mejor te guardas todo eso
A otro perro con ese hueso
Y nos decimos adiós

[Verso 3: Alejandro Sanz]
No te bajes, no te bajes
Oye negrita, mira, no te rajes
De lunes a viernes tienes mi amor
Déjame el sábado a mi que es mejor
Oye mi negra, no me castigues más
Porque allá afuera, sin ti no tengo paz
Yo sólo soy un hombre muy arrepentido
Soy como el ave que vuelve a su nido
[Coro: Shakira & Alejandro Sanz]
Yo sé que no he sido un santo
Es que no estoy hecho de cartón
No solo de pan vive el hombre
Y no de excusas vivo yo
Sólo de errores se aprende
Y hoy sé que es tuyo mi corazón

[Outro: Shakira]
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Ay todo lo que he hecho por ti
Fue una tortura perderte
Me duele tanto que sea así
Sigue llorando, perdón
Yo ya no voy a llorar hoy por ti"

553,2005,Natalie,Goin' Crazy,"[Verse 1]
Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes, the moment that I let you go
I just broke down (Down)

[Verse 2]
Baby, if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice
'Cause the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right
It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
[Verse 3]
Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met, you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak
Tell me that you really need me and you want me and you miss me
And you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waitin' for you
I'll put it down, be the woman for you

[Bridge]
I'm fallin' so deep for you, crazy over for you
I'm callin', callin' out to you
What am I gonna do?
It's true, no frontin'
It's you and no other, I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down (Down)

[Pre-Chorus]
I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you, I'd cross the world
For you, I'd do anything

[Chorus]
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby
[Breakdown]
Ooh-ooh
Crazy, lady, lately
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus / Outro]
Baby
That's right, baby
I'm goin' crazy
I needa be your lady
I've been thinkin' lately
That you and me
Yes, we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me
I'm in love with you, baby"
554,2005,Toby Keith,As Good As I Once Was,"[Verse 1]
She said, ""I've seen you in here before.""
I said, ""I've been here a time or two.""
She said, ""Hello, my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
You're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
I'll put a big Texas smile on your face""
I said, ""Girls,""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Verse 2]
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of redneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
""Hey buddy, how 'bout a helping hand?""
I said, ""Dave,""
[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
My, how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess those boys don't look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was

[Bridge]
I used to be hell on wheels
Back when I was a younger man
Now my body says, ""You can't do this boy""
But my pride says, ""Oh, yes you can""

[Chorus]
I ain't as good as I once was
That's just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back, talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
May not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was"
555,2005,Foo Fighters,Best Of You,"[Verse 1]
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, he best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Transition]
Are you gone and on to someone new?

[Verse 2]
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose

[Verse 3]
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse
[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel

[Chorus 1]
You trust, you must confess
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Break]
Ohh, oh oh
Ohh, oh oh
Ohh, oh oh
Ohh, oh oh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel

[Chorus 2]
The life, the love you'd die to heal
The hope that starts the broken hearts
You trust, you must confess
[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Verse 4]
I've got another confession, my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Has someone taken your faith?
It's real, the pain you feel
[Chorus 2]
You trust, you must confess

[Refrain]
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?"

557,2005,Mario,How Could You,"[Verse 1]
It's kinda crazy babe
How I remember things, (like where you came from and how you had nothin')
I went and made you fly
Put extras on your ride, (didn't miss a birthday now you can't even remember mine)

[Pre-Chorus]
You made it clear to me (you wasn't down for me)
(Love made me blind, baby) but now I see
(You had things up your sleeve, don't even lie to me) I even heard it from your family

[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Verse 2]
You must be out your mind
You got a lot of nerve (to think that I'm gon' chill after all the shit I heard)
I damn near carried you
I could've married you
Good thing I found out before I bought that 7 karat for you
[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you're sick about) the way I found you out
(Go head and pack it out) I hope he's got room in his house
You should have thought of me before you hopped in them sheets
Damn I can't believe that you did this to me

[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you?
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra?
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Bridge]
Girl I tried to give you everything
Can't believe the ways you repaid me
Girl you had it all
But I guess my all wasn't good enough for you
Baby I've accepted it
And I ain't gone trip
Girl I'm moving on
Sometimes I can't help but think that another man's gonna get the one I made for me
[Chorus]
How could you let somebody lay where I laid?
How could you give him everything that we made?
How could you call him all the names that you used to call me?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?
How could you teach him all the things I taught you??
How could you put him on to the Ghetto Kama Sutra??
How could you put me in the back and give him the front seat?
How could you, how could you just forget about me?

[Outro]
How could you? (How could you, how could you just go and lay there?)
(How could you, how could you give him everything?) How could you girl?
How could you? (How could you, how could you call him names like that?) Ooh
(How could you babe, how could you babe?) How could you?..."

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May, he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe
[Bridge]
""There's a light at each end of this tunnel"" you shout
""'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again""
If you only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Oh, breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

560,2005,George Strait,You'll Be There,"[Verse 1]
Hope is an anchor and love is a ship
Time is the ocean and life is a trip
You don't know where you're going
'Til you know where you're at
And if you can't read the stars
Well, you'd better have a map
A compass and a conscience
So you don't get lost at sea
Or on some old lonely island
Where no one wants to be

[Verse 2]
From the beginning of creation
I think our maker had a plan
For us to leave these shores
And sail beyond the sand
And let the good light guide us
To the waves and the wind
To the beaches in a world
Where we have never been
And we'll climb up on the mountain y'all
We'll let our voices ring
And those who've never tried it
They'll be the first to sing
Oh, my, my
[Chorus]
I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

[Verse 3]
You don't bring nothin' with you here
And you can't take nothin' back
I ain't never seen a hearse with a luggage rack
So I've torn my knees a-prayin'
Scarred my back from falling down
Spent so much time flying high
'Til I'm face first in the ground
So if you're up there watching me
Would you talk to God and say
Tell him I might need a hand
To see you both someday
Oh, my, my

[Chorus]
So I'll see you on the other side if I make it
And it might be a long hard ride, but I'm gonna take it
Sometimes it seems that I don't have a prayer
Let the weather take me anywhere
But I know that I want to go
Where the streets are gold 'cause you'll be there
Oh, my, my

561,2005,Trace Adkins,Songs About Me,"[Verse 1]
I met a guy on the red eye
He spotted my guitar and said what do you do?
I said, I sing for a livin'
Country music mixed with a little rock and a little blues
He said I'm sorry but I've never been crazy
'Bout that twang and trains and hillbilly thing
What ever made you want to sing stuff like that?
I just looked at him and laughed and said

[Chorus]
'Cause it's songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

[Verse 2]
So I offered him tickets
I said you'll see what I mean if you show up tonight
He said I doubt you'll change my opinion
I'll be kind of busy, but hey man, I'll try
Then later on when we finished our songs
About scars and cars and broken hearts
I saw him, he was standing there right next to the stage
And he shouted, man you were right it was like you sang those
[Chorus]
Songs about me
And who I am
Songs about lovin' and livin'
And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just
Songs about me
Songs about me

So I'll just keep on singin'
Till I hear the whole world singin', those ole

And good hearted women and family and God
Yeah they're all just

You're keeping in step
In the line
Got your chin held high and you feel just fine
Cause you do
What you're told
But inside your heart it is black and it's hollow and it's cold

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you want to change it?

[Verse 2]
What if this whole crusade's
A charade
And behind it all there's a price to be paid
For the blood
Which we dine
Justified in the name of the holy and the divine

[Chorus]
Just how deep do you believe?
Will you bite the hand that feeds?
Will you chew until it bleeds?
Can you get up off your knees?
Are you brave enough to see?
Do you wanna change it?
[Bridge]
So naïve
I keep holding on to what I want to believe
I can see
But I keep holding on and on and on and on

[Outro]
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?
Will you bite the hand that feeds you?
Will you stay down on your knees?"
563,2005,Audioslave,Be Yourself,"[Verse 1]
Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
She finally drifts away
Someone gets excited in a chapel yard, catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, and to be yourself is all that you can do
Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do

[Verse 2]
Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
Someone swears his true love until the end of time, another runs away
Separate or united, healthy or insane

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do  (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
Every single memory of the good or bad
Faces of luck, don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything will end up alright
You may win or lose
[Pre-Chorus]
But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
To be yourself is all that you can do, oh

[Chorus]
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh
To be yourself is all that you can do (All that you can do), oh-yeah
To be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can—
Be yourself is all that you can do"

Who broke a window last week

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off-key in the pew behind me

[Chorus 1]
That's what I love about Sunday
Sing along as the choir sways
Every verse of Amazing Grace
And then we shake the preacher's hand
Go home, into your blue jeans
Have some chicken and some baked beans
Pick a backyard football team
Not do much of anything
That's what I love about Sunday
[Verse 2]
I stroll to the end of the drive, pick up the Sunday Times
Grab a coffee cup
It looks like Sally and Ron, finally tied the knot
Well, it's about time
[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's thirty-five cents off of ground round, baby, cut that coupon out
[Chorus 2]
That's what I love about Sunday
Cat-napping on the porch swing
You curled up next to me
The smell of jasmine wakes us up
Take a walk down a back road
Tackle box and a cane pole
Carve our names in that white oak
And steal a kiss as the sun fades
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah
[Bridge]
Ooh, new believers getting baptized
Momma's hands raised up high
Ain't it a Hallelujah good time
A smile on everybody's face
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah

[Outro]
That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah"

Monday, hard to wake up
Fill my coffee cup, I'm out the door

It's gonna make me late, and that's for sure

I'm running out of gas and out of time
Never gonna make it there by nine

I used to be the dude up in the club poppin' bottles wrist glistening
Shorty tried to tell me chill but I wasn't listening
I can't deny it you knew me for being immature
Only way of saying sorry take you to the ?? store
You told me all you really wanted was to see me more
Then the stress hit me hard like a meteor
I hit rock bottom you was there to pick me up
I neglected you we didn't hug didn't kiss enough
But you never threw nothing up in my face
Gave me all your love and your warm embrace yeah
Now I see I'll never find another like you
You the type boo make a playa wanna wife you
With me and you, this money's not an issue
And I miss you when I touch you I can feel it in my bone gristle
I'm still with you and I'm sorry bout the way I did you
Know it must have igged you but the trackman you know I'm getting?

No, ooh

Sometimes a man has to choose
And do something he doesn't wanna do
Do I live my life with you as my wife
Or do I go on and pursue my lifetime dream?
I gotta do this for me
'Cause if I don't, I'll probably regret it
But if I do, I'll probably regret it
How do I cope?

[Chorus]
How do you cope when
The one you love is with somebody else
And there's nothing you could do about it?
How do you deal with
The fact that you had a chance
But you chose to turn away for your career
I gotta take it, though it's heartbreakin'
It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad
So how do I live
How do I deal without you?
[Verse 2]
It's killing me to know that your heart's with me
But you're with him 'cause I chose to be in this industry
Money, shows, and hoes come along with luxury and pain
Is all you see when you think about it (About it)
But this is the life that I was given
So I have to live it to the fullest
But how do I deal in the meantime without you?

It's something that I had to do
But nobody said that it would hurt so bad

How do you deal when you can't be with
The one you love, but the one you love is with somebody else

What do you do when you know she don't love him
But she loves me, but she can't stand lovin' you far away?

You just deal with it, deal with it

I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
'Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

[Verse 3: The Game]
The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun
[Chorus: The Game & (Sample)]
Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed
Cause Martin Luther King had a (""Dream"")
Aaliyah had a (""Dream""), Left Eye had a (""Dream"")
So I reached out to Kanye and (""I brought you all my dreams 'cause I love you"")
(""I—love you""
""I—love you""
""I-I-I love you"")

This song is dedicated to Yetunde Price
The sister of Venus and Serena Williams
Who was slain during a gang shootout in Compton
Sunday, September 14th, 2003: rest in peace

576,2005,Kenny Chesney,Keg In The Closet,"[Verse 1]
We had a dog named Bocephus living in the front yard
He liked sleeping out on the top of the car
He drank beer out of the mason jar
And he'd climb up on everyone in bed
A white frame house, a college town
A bunch of people always hanging around
No real problems we needed to drown but we tried our best anyway
We went to class just to pass the time, back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet

[Verse 2]
This old guitar taught me how to score, right there on the Lambda Chi porch
Mary Ann taught me a little more about wanting what you can't have
Sweatshirts and flag football, spring breaks down in Panama
For a while we had it all, we never dreamed it wouldn't last
We went to class just to pass the time back in eighty nine

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet
[Bridge]
We all kind of went our separate ways, but I swear it seems like yesterday

[Chorus]
We had a, keg in the closet, pizza on the floor
Left over from the night before
Where we were going we didn't really care
We had all we ever wanted
In that keg in the closet"

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh huh

[The Game]
I need a ""Real Love"", Mary, holla at me if you need a real thug
We could ride through Compton and see real Bloods
Real Crips and I'mma always hold you down, that's real shit
I'm the Los Angeles king and ""You Remind Me"" of Mary, the R&B queen
I got the ""411"", what's crackin'
What I owe you for helpin' me go four times Platinum
I add a kid to ""My Life"", he's almost two
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is thank you
For over ten years of the ghetto gospel
You've paved the way for young black women to prosper
How you paint pictures you deserve Grammys and Oscars
Congratulations for me, Aftermath, and the Doctor
So niggas go 'head and envy me
I'm Billboard's Top 10 featuring M.J.B

[Mary J. Blige]
When you learn stepped in this game
After ""What's The 411?"", things ain't been the same
And I can't complain
But with all this fame comes a whole lot of pain
But I'm so glad to be here
And my music's still sincere
Lets get back to the story
All of this pain and glory
And 94 was ""My Life"" and my life wasn't right
So I reached out to you and told you what I've been through
[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

And I came and ""Shared My World""
But at that point I was just a foolish girl
Tryin to find my way
And I dropped a ""Mary"" album and people would say
That it's just not gonna work and my feelings they did hurt
But my fans showed me so much love and I owe it all to them
Then I came with ""No More Drama"", I remember that week
It was when Aaliyah died, I couldn't hardly sleep
Thought about it every day
And it made me change my ways
I'm a real woman, now because of all of these days

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
[Bridge]
""You Remind Me"" of a ""Real Love""
You don't have to worry (""Real Love"")
""All Night Long"" ""I'm Goin' Down""
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-dahh
Do-do-do-do-do-dahh
""Reminisce"" on the love we had
""You Are Everything"" ""Love Without A Limit""
What are you gonna do without ""My Life, My Life, My Life, My Life""

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Mary J]
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me
(Hate it or love it the underdogs' on top
And I'm gon' shine, homey until my heart stop)
Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

Go head and envy me, I'm a soul hip-hop queen
And I ain't goin' nowhere but you already know me

Right now, I just wanna thank Dr. Dre

Yeah baby, hehe, yeah!
Back again (that's right) Luda! Ha ha ha ha (Feel this)
It gets meaner and meaner each time baby
Feelin real good too (holla at 'em man) What up Uncle 'Face! (Yeah)
I'm a bull in this industry man (tell 'em)
Some would rather run down and get one cow (nah)
I think I'd rather walk down and get 'em all
You know what I'm talkin 'bout right? Look

[Verse 1]
I'm never going nowhere so don't try me
My music sticks in fans' veins like an IV
Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy
Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin to sign me
Respected highly, ""Hi, Mr. O'Reilly!""
Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey
Drove through the window, the industry super sized me
Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me
I'm on the rise, so many people despise me
Got party ammunition for those tryin to surprise me (surprise!)
It's a celebration and everyone should invite me
Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!)
Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me
My whole aura's so MEAN in my white tee
Nobody light-skinned did reppin harder since Ice-T
You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me!

Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?)

[Verse 2]
Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala
If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla
In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha
Father, father, and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold
Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled
A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight
The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy
I'm +XXL+ so I call 'em my +Eye Candy+
Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar
Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars

Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master
Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards
These women trying to get me out my Pelle Pelles
They strip off my clothes and tell me, ""Get in my belly!""
Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin like Flo-Jo
Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh, boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world!

They wouldn't holla cause my dollars wasn't swoll enough
I bet they change they mind when them 84's come rollin up
They see that I'm a star, now they wanna sit in my car
Now they wanna count my cheese, smoke my weed and sip my barre now
They used to love to me diss me, now they rush to hug and kiss me now
They tellin' all they friends when I leave how they miss me now

Same size a year later the same hoes wanna fuck me
Because they see me paid, pimpin pens, workin my jelly
And I ain't trippin' cause my pockets stick out mo' than my belly
They know I'm paid, livin' laid in the shade
Two slabs in the Escalade with fo' or five estates
Then know that I got it made, I'm a motherfuckin baller she would
Want a nigga now but I ain't got no time to call her
I'ma stall her like she stalled me, now she tryna call me

Sing it, hoes (The world, the world, The world)
All over the world, baby
It's only right that I share my experiences with y'all
Cause I've been places you'll never imagine
But I'mma start it at home
When I see a girl I like
I walk straight up to them and I'm like (ugh)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes

[Verse 2: Ludacris]
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
Cause see me my pimpin's in 3D
I'm takin' you places you only see on TV
Tryna show ya how you livin' is trife
How many guys you know can bring the travel channel to life
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Next day we in the sun on the Virgin Islands
If you with me ain't no time to sleep
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
But I drive you off and pay you no attention
If make it to Atlantas Brina Brothers convention
Then jump in the car and just ride for hours
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Hawaii to D.C. it's plenty women to see
So if yo ass don't show up it's more women for me (heyy)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm in New York at the Puerto Rican Day Parade
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
In Mardi Gras all the women tryna show me they chest (heyy)
I'm in Jamaica spendin massive bucks
While the ladies all beggin' me to mashatuck
I had, sad beginnings when I rapped with no fans
Now it's all happy endings on my lap in Japan (heyy)
I used to think that it was way too cold
'Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
Then fly to Illinois to get a taste of Chicago (ugh)
Oh yet and still
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
(But where the best at?) Ain't no need of even askin' brah
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real

Ladies and gentlemen as we ride out
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Now ladies look around with me
Let's see if we can weed some of these niggas out
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
Now if you happen to see a nigga
With two sweat patches up under his arms
Look like he been swimmin' in shoulder height water
Please tell that nigga ""put your hands down""
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Please ""put your hands down""
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
Please say ""put your hands down""
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If you are dancin' on the dancefloor
And you look to your left and your right
And you do not see a woman in sight
Guess what? You guessed it - you are not pimpin
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
That's why it's three dollars a glass
""Put your hands down""
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks
NOT PIMPIN!

Well I was sitting, waiting, wishing
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you'd see the signs

But lord knows that this world is cruel
And I ain't  the lord no I'm just a fool
Learning loving somebody don't make them love you

[Chorus]
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?

[Verse 2]
I sang your songs I danced your dance
I gave your friends all a chance
But putting up with them
Wasn't worth never having you
Ah maybe you've been through this before
But it's my first time so please ignore
The next few lines 'cause they're directed at you

[Chorus]
I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool
[Bridge]
I keep playing your part
But it's not my scene
Want this plot to twist
I've had enough mystery
Keep building it up
But then you're shooting me down
But I'm already down

[Refrain]
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting
Just wait a minute
Just sitting, waiting

[Verse 3]
Well if I was in your position
I'd put down all my ammunition
I'd wonder why'd it taken me so long

But lord knows that I'm not you
And if I was I wouldn't be so cruel
'Cause waiting on love
Ain't so easy to do

Must I always be waiting, waiting on you?
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?
No I can't always be waiting, waiting on you
I can't always be playing, playing your fool

You twisted my heart 'til something snapped inside

But my give a damn's busted
You can crawl back home, say you were wrong
Stand out in the yard and cry all night long
Go ahead and water the lawn
My give a damn's busted

I really wanna care
I wanna feel somethin'
Let me dig a little deeper
No, sorry, nothing

It's all your parents fault, I mean, after all, you didn't pick 'em
Maybe somebody else has got time to listen

A product of the Prozac and your codependent ways
So, who's your enabler these days?
My give a damn's busted

I wanna feel something
Let me dig a little deeper
No, still nothing

584,2005,Faith Hill,Mississippi Girl,"[Intro]
Well, it's a long way from Star, Mississippi
To the big stage I'm singing on tonight
And sometimes the butterflies still get me
When I'm in the spotlight

[Verse 1]
And some people seem to think that I've changed
That I'm different than I was back then
But in my soul, I know that I'm the same way
That I've really always been

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Verse 2]
Well, I spent a few weeks in California
They put my face on the big movie screen
But that don't mean I've forgotten where I came from
That's just me chasing dreams, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways
Just 'cause everybody knows her name
Ain't big-headed from a little bit of fame
I still like wearing my old ball cap
Ride my kids around piggy back
They might know me all around the world
But y'all, I'm still a Mississippi girl

Mississippi girl
Oh
Mississippi girl
Mississippi girl
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

585,2005,Montgomery Gentry,Gone,"[Verse 1]
This ain't no temporary, typical, tearful goodbye
This ain't no breakin' up, then wakin' up and makin' up one more time
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

[Chorus]
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!

[Verse 2]
This ain't no 'give it time, I'm hurtin' but maybe we can work it out'
Won't be no champagne, red rose, romance, second chance
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone

[Chorus]
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac
Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
She's gone!
This is gone (gone), gone (gone), gone (gone), gone
Gone like a freight train
Gone like yesterday
Gone like a soldier in the Civil War
Bang Bang!
Gone like a '59 Cadillac

Like all the good things, that ain't never comin' back
She's gone

Long gone, don't be wrong, never comin' back, my baby's gone
She's gone
Wanna get home, sittin' alone, so pack your bags, and now she's gone
Never comin' back, she's gone
No, no, never
No, no, never

No, no, never comin' back

Now I done felt a lot of pain
I done seen a lot of things
From struggling and broken hearts to fancy cars, ooh yeah
And even though my money change
I try my best to stay the same
But you know with more money, more problems came
But if I...

That's how I know He's watching me
(He's watching me)

[Verse 2]
In ATL I caught a case
And the media tried to say
I had a habit
I couldn't manage
And I'm throwing my life away (ooh yeah)
But everything ain't what it seems
Just because it's on TV
'Cause they speculate and exaggerate for a better story

If I had to do it all again (had to do it)
I wouldn't take away the rain (no)
'Cause I know it made me who I am
If I had to do it all again (yeah)

Nobody knows what life may bring
It might make you happy, it might make you sad
Sometimes yeah
But I know there's a reason for everything (but I know)
That's why I keep believing
Whatever's meant to be is gonna be

If I had to do it all again (oh, if I...)
I wouldn't take away the rain
'Cause I know it make me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me (oh, if I...)
If I had to do it all again
I wouldn't take away the rain
'Cause I know it make me who I am
If I had to do it all again
I've learned so much from my mistakes
That's how I know He's watching me (oh yeah yeah)"

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around
What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town

Well, ask anybody I'm a pretty good guy
And the looks decent wagon didn't pass me by
There ain't nothin in my past that I'm tryin hard to hide
And I don't understand why I gotta wonder why

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down

Had an old man tell me ""Boy if you were smart
You'd hit the produce isle at the Super Walmart""
So I bumped into a pretty girl's shopping cart
But all I did was break her eggs and bruise her artichoke hearts

What's a guy gotta do to get a girl in this town
Don't wanna be alone when the sun goes down
Just a sweet little somethin to put my arms around

Can you meet me down at the railroad tracks?
I got Tom Petty playin' in my Silverado
And I iced down a six-pack, uh-oh

Hey Daisy don't you worry 'bout your mama
Like 007 we can keep it covert
Undercover on the ground by the water
Gonna get a little peace on earth

[Chorus:]
Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby, pickin' wildflowers

Hey baby, Mother Nature is waitin'
And love's bloomin' like a cherry tree
Let's buzz around, maybe do some pollinating
Dive on in like honey bees

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
You and me baby
Pickin' wildflowers
Take a trail ride if you know what I mean
Hey baby won't you come with me?

Baby whatcha say we go pickin' wildflowers?
Got a spot way back in the woods
Sneak away for a couple of hours
Spend a little time, pickin' wildflowers

Sneak away for a couple of hours

592,2005,Darryl Worley,If Something Should Happen,"Buddy you and me go way back
Camp Lejeune, all through high school
And before that
So I don't mind telling you I'm scared to death
The doctor's going in on the 25th
It's the same thing my daddy had
Thank God they caught it fast

But if something should happen
Stop in sometime and say hello to Katherine
You and Mary Anne could always keep her laughing
She's going to need a lot of that
Take her out to a movie
Its going to take some time before she's back on her feet
I know you think that I'll be fine and I'm talking crazy
But there's always that chance
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

Little Nathan's growing up so fast
This November he'll turn 10
He wants to play quarterback
I'm supposed to coach his team this fall
But I may not get to after all
He's going to need someone to catch a pass
And to throw it back
If something should happen
Oh promise me you'll take that boy out camping
Throw a line out in that water every now and then
Answer any question that he has
Maybe once he gets older
You can sit and have that first cold beer together
And tell him a couple stories on his father
He's always known you were my best friend
That's why I'm asking
If something should happen

I hope I live until I'm 80
And I get to see my son get married
And have babies
And make a million more memories with my wife
Yeah buddy I pray alright
But if its my time to leave
Would you watch over them for me?
If something should happen
If something should happen

[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might
Desert me

[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
Forever ever? Forever ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Close your eyes and imagine, feel the magic
Vegas on acid, seen through Yves St. Laurent glasses
And I've realized that I've arrived
'Cause it take more than a magazine to kill my Vibe
""Does he write his own rhymes?"" Well, sort of, I think 'em
That mean I forgot better shit than you ever thought of
""Damn, is he really that caught up?""
I ask, if you talkin' about classics, do my name get brought up?
I remember I couldn't afford a Ford Escort
Or even a four-track recorder
So it's only right that I let the top drop on a drop-top Porsche
Spoil yourself, that's important
If your stripper name ""Porsche"" and you get tips from many men
Then your fat friend, her nickname is ""Minivan""
Excuse me, that's just the Henny, man
I smoke, I drink, I'm supposed to stop, I can't, because—
[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe

Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I was sick about awards, couldn't nobody cure me
Only playa that got robbed but kept all his jewelry
Alicia Keys tried to talk some sense in him
Thirty minutes later seein' there's no convincin' him
What more could you ask for? The international asshole
Who complain about what he is owed?
And throw a tantrum like he is three years old
You gotta love it though: somebody still speaks from his soul
And wouldn't change by the change or the game or the fame
When he came in the game, he made his own lane
Now all I need is y'all to pronounce my name
It's Kanye, but some of my plaques, they still say ""Kayne""
Got family in the D, Kin-folk from Motown
Back in the Chi, them Folks ain't from Moe Town
Life movin' too fast, I need to slow down
Girl ain't give me no ass, you need to go down
My father been said I need Jesus
So he took me to church and let the water wash over my caesar
The preacher said we need leaders
Right then, my body got still like a paraplegic
You know who you call; you got a message, then leave it
The Roc stand tall and you would never believe it
Take your diamonds and throw 'em up like you bulimic
Yeah, the beat cold, but the flow is anemic
After debris settles and the dust get swept off
Big K pick up where young Hov left off
Right when magazines wrote Kanye West off
I dropped my new shit, it sound like the best of
A&R's lookin' like, ""Pssh, we messed up.""
Grammy night, damn right, we got dressed up
Bottle after bottle 'til we got messed up
In the studio with Really Doe, yeah, he next up
People askin' me if I'm gon' give my chain back
That'll be the same day I give the game back
You know the next question, dog: ""Yo, where Dame at?""
This track the Indian dance to bring our reign back
""What's up with you and Jay, man? Are y'all okay, man?""
They pray for the death of our dynasty like ""Amen""
R-r-r-r-right here stands a man
With the power to make a diamond with his bare hands
[Hook: Shirley Bassey & Kanye West]
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever)
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Diamonds are forever (forever, forever, forever)
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme

It's your life, you say you need a change
Don't all the dreams we've seen come true mean anything
You say it's different now and you keep starin' at the door
How can you walk away, don't I matter anymore

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

[Verse 2]
If we had known our love would come to this
We could have saved our hearts the hurt of wasted years
Well it's been fun, what else can I say
If the feeling's gone words won't stop you anyway

[Chorus]
If bein' free's worth what you leave behind
And if it's too late for love to change your mind
Then it's goodbye time

598,2005,Bobby Pinson,Don't Ask Me How I Know,"Don't ride your bike off a ramp that's more than three bricks high
Don't take that candy from the store if you ain't got the dime
Don't pick a fight with a little guy that doesn't talk that much
Don't pick up a cherrybomb thinkin' it's a dud
And don't sneak out of a 2 story house usin' bed sheets for a rope
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus:)
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', save the Jesus off the dash
Say a prayer when you feel like cussin', save your money pay with cash
Forget your pride, buy the roses, if you're sorry tell her so
Don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know

Don't quit your high school football team halfway through the season
Don't bust your buddy in the nose when you know he didn't mean it
Don't lose a girl you love at home for a night in Panama City
Don't rush off the phone when your Mama calls you ain't that busy
Ya oughta make that drive to say goodbye to your grampa â€˜fore he goes
Don't ask me how I know

(Chorus)
Forget your pride buy the roses, if you love her tell her so
Don't go to Vegas with your heart broke
Don't bum your cousin for that first smoke
I'm tellin' ya, don't drink the water in Mexico
Don't ask me how I know
Don't ask me how I know
I just know
Sell your truck while it's still runnin', say a prayer when you feel like cussin'
I know"

Where is the moment we needed the most?
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Verse 2]
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
Because you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
[Verse 3]
Will you need a blue sky holiday?
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on

[Chorus]
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me, don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
(Ooh, a holiday)

Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well, oh, that strong
And I'm not wrong
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Breakdown]
So where is the passion when you need it the most?
Oh, you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost

[Chorus 2]
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you're like
And how does it feel?
One more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

Nope
Didn't think so

How you doin', young lady?
That feeling that you giving really drives me crazy
You don't, have a player 'bout to choke
I was at a loss for words first time that we spoke
You lookin' for a girl that'll treat you right?
How you lookin' for her in the daytime with the light?
You might be the type if I play my cards right
I'll find out by the end of the night
You expect me to just let you hit it?
But will you still respect me if you get it?
All I can do is try, gimme one chance (Chance)
What's the problem? I don't see no ring on your hand (Hand)
I'll be the first to admit it
I'm curious about you, you seem so innocent
You wanna get in my world, get lost in it?
Boy, I'm tired of runnin', let's walk for a minute

[Chorus: Nelly Furtado & Timbaland]
Promiscuous girl, wherever you are
I'm all alone, and it's you that I want
Promiscuous boy, you already know

You know what I want, and I got what you need
Promiscuous boy, let's get to the point
'Cause we're on a roll, you ready?

Roses are red, some diamonds are blue
Chivalry is dead, but you're still kinda cute
Hey, I can't keep my mind off you
Where you at? Do you mind if I come through?
I'm out of this world, come with me to my planet
Get you on my level, do you think that you can handle it?
They call me Thomas, last name Crown
Recognize game, I'ma lay mine's down
I'm a big girl, I can handle myself
But if I get lonely, I'ma need your help
Pay attention to me, I don't talk for my health
I want you on my team
So does everybody else
Shh, baby, we can keep it on the low (Low)
Let your guard down, ain't nobody gotta know (Know)
If you with it, girl, I know a place we can go
What kind of girl do you take me for?

Wait, I don't mean no harm
I can see you with my t-shirt on
I can see you with nothin' on
Feelin' on me before you bring that on
Bring that on?!
You know what I mean
Girl, I'm a freak, you shouldn't say those things
I'm only trying to get inside of your brain
To see if you can work me the way you say
It's okay, it's alright
I got something that you gon' like
Hey, is that the truth or are you talking trash?
Is your game M.V.P like Steve Nash?

603,2006,Fort Minor Featuring Holly Brook,Where'd You Go,"[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
She said, ""Some days, I feel like shit
Some days, I wanna quit and just be normal for a bit""
I don't understand why you have to always be gone
I get along, but the trips always feel so long
And I find myself trying to stay by the phone
'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone
But I feel like an idiot, working my day around the call
But when I pick up, I don't have much to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Come back home, you know, the place where you used to live
Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile
But now, you only stop by every once in a while
Shit, I find myself just filling my time
With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way
You can call me if you find that you have something to say

[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, at times debating
Telling you that I've had it with you and your career
Me and the rest of the family here, singing, ""Where'd you go?""

[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Bridge: Mike Shinoda]
I want you to know it's a little fucked up
That I'm stuck here waiting, no longer debating
Tired of sitting and hating and making these excuses
For why you're not around, and feeling so useless
It seems one thing has been true all along
You don't really know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess I've had it with you and your career
When you come back, I won't be here and you can sing it
[Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Where'd you go? I miss you so
Seems like it's been forever that you've been gone
Please come back home

[Post-Chorus: Skylar Grey & Jonah Matranga]
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home
Please come back home

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressin', incessantly pressin' the issue
'Cause every moment gone, you know I miss you

My tummy's up in knots and when I see you, it gets so hot

Take on me (Uh-huh), you know inside you feel it right
Take me on, I could just die up in your arms tonight

I never knew that everything was falling through
That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue
To turn and run when all I needed was the truth
But that's how it's gotta be
It's coming down to nothing more than apathy
I'd rather run the other way than stay and see
The smoke and who's still standing when it clears

And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind, she's on your mind

Let's rearrange
I wish you were a stranger I could disengage
Just say that we agree and then never change
Soften a bit until we all just get along
But that's disregard
You find another friend and you discard
As you lose the argument in a cable car
Hanging above as the canyon comes between
[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on, on

[Bridge]
And suddenly, I've become a part of your past
I'm becoming the part that don't last
I'm losing you and it's effortless
Without a sound, we lose sight of the ground
In the throw around
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down
I won't let it go down 'til we torch it ourselves

[Chorus]
And everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind
Everyone knows
She's on your mind
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
I'm in over my head, I'm over my...
Everyone knows I'm in
Over my head
Over my head
With eight seconds left in overtime
She's on your mind
She's on your mind"

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was  anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', ""Baby, what you gonna—?""
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death

California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah

Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say

[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast

[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace

611,2006,Rihanna,Unfaithful,"[Verse 1]
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Woah, anymore

And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

He's always in the club,"" and they say

You too smart, you'd be a dummy to believe
That stuff that you heard that they say about me
They say that I'm this, they say that I'm that
But all of it's fiction, none of it's fact
But you don't be hearin' it about your lover
You let it go in one ear and out the other
Now he say, she say, they say, I heard
If they fake, we can't let it get on our nerves
She miserable, she just want you to be
Like her, misery needs company
So don't listen to that vine of grapes - They're
Nuttin' but liars hatin', and I bet
They wouldn't mind tradin' pla-ces
With you by my side in my Mercedes

Haters throw salt like rice at a weddin
So what, that's your cousin, they don't mean nuthin'
Her like missin' a type of affection you get
You just blind to the facts
See the lies just as obvious as cries for attention
Fuel to the fire, that supplies your suspicion
But listen, say you love me, gotta trust me
Why you stress this high school mess?
Break up never, they just jealous!
Drama from your momma, mean mug from your brothers
I'm that author of the book, they can judge from the cover
Yes - I, I been to jail
And yes - I'm grindin' for real
I'm a positive-talkin' negative pimp
They hate to see you doin' better than them, so!

[Verso 1: Lil Wayne]
El joven Carter, soy mejor que los otros
No miento, me puedo tomar un verano libre
Puedo hacerselo a una mujer, puedo adelgazarla
Uno de mis coches, ahora voy sobre cosas buenas
Alinéalo, te garantizo que te voy a servir
El joven Chris dijo, ""run it"", así que corrí y se lo dije
Soy el joven Cash Money, Birdman Junior
Un presidente buscando una Monica

[Verso 2: Chris Brown]
El joven acaba de hacer 16, tengo el 64 (Chevrolet) y buenas motos
Tengo a 3 o 4 chicas, pero todo ese movimiento en ese bikini me vuelve loco
Para todo el tráfico en un ""stop"" porque hablas ese idioma que hablo
Ese tempo descarado con ese andar, quizás es la razón que todas estas no me verán

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
[Verso 3: Chris Brown]
Un descanso, dejame explicarte, que tu cuerpo me tiene preparado para hacerlo
Si tomas la oportunidad de que me ponga encima
Te puedo enseñar porqué lo hago bien, sobresalientes en la escuela
Soy un luchador, confia en mi y en mi edad, te tengo pensando de que soy demasiado joven para hacerlo
Puedo imaginarnos cambiando de carril en el Coupe, contigo en el teléfono gritando mi nombre, Chris

[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame

[Puente]
Chica, en serio, te he estado mirando, esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice
Esto es lo que tu cuerpo dice

[Verso 4: Lil Wayne]
Cariño, ¿qué tal?, intento saludarte
No estoy decepcionado, pero te cegaré si te sonrío
Estás con el joven Chris y el mejor rapero
Deja tu teléfono, trae a tus amigas, deja que lo demás pase
Un poco de Patron, Hennessy, estoy bebiendo Cavalli Vodka
Llevo tejanos y calzoncillos Cavalli, mejor que un recién nacido
Puedo trabajarte como un sofá
Puedes quedarte desnuda
Me dejo las botas y mis joyas
Nunca sé lo que quieras, voy a dejarmelo puesto
Nunca sabes quién está en casa, lo aprendí de esa canción de Biggie
A una nueva, algo como una blanca
Creo que le gusto, me tiene de tono de llamada
Y le dije, ""Ten lo tuyo y no pares""
Dame ese ritmo y lo que tienes
[Estribillo]
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame
Puedes ser 3 años mayor pero estás bien, dame eso
Hablas como si te gustara lo que tengo, dame eso
Sé que te gusta como voy en mi Cadillac
Podrías estar en la parte de atrás diciendo, dame, dame, dame"

My life is brilliant
[Verse 1]
My life is brilliant, my love is pure
I saw an angel, of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, she caught my eye, as I walked on by
She could see from my face that I was, fucking high
And I don't think that I'll see her again
But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
I saw your face, in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I'll never be with you
[Interlude]
Na na na na
Na na na na
Na na na na, na

[Outro Chorus]
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
You're beautiful, it's true
There must be an angel, with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But it's time to face the truth
I will never be with you"
622,2006,Kelly Clarkson,Walk Away,"[Verse 1]
You've got your mother and your brother
Every other undercover telling you what to say (What to say)
You think I'm stupid, but the truth is that it's cupid, baby
Lovin' you has made me this way
So before you point your finger
Get your hands off of my trigger
Oh, yeah
You need to know this situation's getting old
And now the more you talk, the less I can take, oh

[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

[Verse 2]
I waited here for you like a kid waiting after school
So tell me how come you never showed? (Never showed)
I gave you everything and never asked for anything
And look at me, I'm all alone (Alone)
So, before you start defending
Baby, stop all your pretending
I know you know I know
So what's the point in being slow?
Let's get the show on the road today
Hey!
[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Just walk away
Just walk away
Just walk away

[Bridge]
I wanna love, I wanna fire
To feel the burn, my desires
I want a man by my side
Not a boy who runs and hides
Are you gonna fight for me?
Die for me?
Live and breathe for me?
Do you care for me?
'Cause if you don't, then boy, just leave

[Chorus]
I'm looking for attention, not another question
Should you stay or should you go?
Well, if you don't have the answer
Why you still standin' here?
Hey, hey, hey, hey (Walk away)
Just walk away
[Outro]
If you don't have the answer (Walk away)
Just walk (Walk) away
(Just walk away)
Then just leave
Yeah, yeah
Walk away

But for right now, what we gotta do for y'all (what we gonna do)
We gotta give y'all a hit (huh)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
Niggas in my face, damn near er' day
Ask a million questions like, Joc where ya' stay?
Tell 'em Collegepark, where they chop cars
Get twenty grand, spend a grand at the bar
Jest bought a zone, J's on my feet
I'm on that Patron, so get like me
'69 Cutlass with the bucket seats
Beat in my trunk, bought it just for the freaks
Catch me in the hood, posted at the store
Pistol in my lap, on the phone counting dough
If a girl choose, let her do her thing
Just like her mama, nice ass, nice brain
Er'body love me, I'm so fly
Niggas throw the deuces er'time I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what you do (OK)

Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 2: Yung Joc]
Verse number two, do the damn thing
Cubes on my neck, pockets full of Ben Frank's
When I'm in the mall, hoes just pause
I pop a few tags, give me that on the wall
Time to flip the work, make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Dope boy magic, seven days a week
Number one record, long as Nitti on the beat
Oh I think they like me, better yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggas know my crew, we certified stars
Valet in the front 'bout thirty-five cars
Bitches in the back, black Beamer coupe's
Girls liking girls, time to recruit
If ya' got a problem, say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place
[Hook: Yung Joc]
Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down
Meet me in the club, it's goin' down
Anywhere ya meet me, guaranteed to go down

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Time to set it off, let these nigga know
Have ya ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow, no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya' see the buckets on my feet
Fans on my trail, but they don't think I know
I keep my hands clean casue I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em, look 'em in they eyes
Ask me how I know, its me, surprise
Put it in the air, rep where ya' stay
Take a step back, blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit, let 'em see the karats
I'mma make it rain nigga, I ain't scared to share it

Meet me in the trap, it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall, it's goin' down

Knowing that it makes you madder (uh, oh)

I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house
That don’t bother me
I can take a few tears now and then and just let them out
I’m not afraid to cry every once in a while
Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me
There are days every now and again I pretend I’m okay
But that’s not what gets me

[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Was being so close
And havin' so much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing
What could've been
And not seein' that love in you
Is what I was tryin’ to do

[Verse 2]
It’s hard to deal with the pain of losing you everywhere I go
But I’m doin’ It
It’s hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I’m alone
Still harder
Gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin’ with this regret
But I know if I could do it over
I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart
That I left unspoken
[Chorus]
What hurts the most
Is being so close
And havin' so much to say much to say
And watchin' you walk away
And never knowing

Now, I just wonder if he know he close to being replaced
Swear I treat you like a queen you put me in his place
So you can give back his ring and the key to his place
Tell the nigga one thing, that you need your space
Selling niggas one thing, you don't need to chase
I wanna kiss you everywhere between your knees and waist
Hear the sounds that you making, get your knees to shake
Holla at me in the A, you feel you need to escape
I got a mansion and a gate, you with me and you safe
A Benz, a Phantom and a truck with 23's the case
600 G's in the safe, how much cheese it take?
This a chance you need to take, ain't no need to wait
Say the word, we can leave today, this song's special
And it feel like fate, hate to make a mistake
How the same thing making you sad making you stay?
[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye

[Verse 2]
Can he touch it like that, and make it feel like this?
How I left and came back and it's still like this?
Do he hit it from the back and make you feel it in your chest?
Take advantage of what you're concealing in your dress?
What, he think he too fresh to show that you the best?
Compliment you on your intellect and treat you with respect?
Give you sex 'til you sweat, tongue kissing on your neck?
It's been awhile since she got it like this, I bet
I can tell you ain't just another bitch I met
Ain't nobody got me open like this, not yet
You confused, ain't decided which way you should go yet
So how you keep saying no with your panties so wet?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
[Interlude]
Ay, this nigga playing mind games, man
I think the time came that your mind changed, you understand?
Life is like a chess move
You need to make your next move your best move
Keep it pimpin', you understand? Hey
I mean, you know what I'm saying
I done showed you how I feel, you know what I'm saying
I put myself all the way out there, you know
The ball in your court, man
But I just got a question for you: Is you happy?

[Chorus]
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that… aye-aye
Go and tell a nigga no with a ass so fat
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that-that-that?
In a relationship, been faithful to a nigga so wack
Hey, why you wanna go and do that, love, huh?
Hey-hey why you wanna go and do that, do that?

633,2006,Bon Jovi,Who Says You Can't Go Home,"[Verse 1]
I spent 20 years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back on the seeds I've sown
Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 2]
I went as far as I could, I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy, but not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home
[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright

[Verse 3]
I been there, done that and I ain't looking back
It's been a long long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter where you go
If it's a million miles aways or just a mile up the road
Take it in, take it with you when you go
Who says you can't go home

[Chorus]
Who says you can't go home
There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy, born a rolling stone, who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go back, been all around the world and as a matter of fact
There's only one place left I want to go, who says you can't go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, its alright
Who says you can't go home
Who says you can't go home"
634,2006,Gnarls Barkley,Crazy,"[Verse 1]
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

[Chorus 1]
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

[Verse 2]
And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

[Chorus 2]
Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me
[Verse 3]
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

[Chorus 3]
But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"

Summertime is finally here
That old ballpark, man, is back in gear
Out on 49
Man I can see the lights

School's out and the nights roll in
Man, just like a long lost friend
You ain't seen in a while
And can't help but smile

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Perfect song on the radio
Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime
Sweet summertime

Temperature says 93
Down at the Deposit and Guarantee
But that swimming hole
It's nice and cold
Bikini bottoms underneath
But the boys' hearts still skip a beat
When them girls shimmy off
Them old cutoffs

And it's two bare feet on the dashboard
Young love and an old Ford
Cheap shades and a tattoo
And a Yoo-Hoo bottle on the floorboard

Sing along cause it's one we know
It's a smile, it's a kiss
It's a sip of wine, it's summertime

The more they stay the same

Forgive, sounds good
Forget, I'm not sure I could
They say time heals everything
But I'm still waiting

[Verse 2]
I'm through with doubt
There's nothin' left for me to figure out
I've paid a price
And I'll keep payin'

[Chorus]
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should

[Verse 3]
I know you've said
""Can't you just get over it?""
It turned my whole world around
And I kinda like it
[Bridge]
I made my bed and I sleep like a baby
With no regrets and I don't mind sayin'
It's a sad, sad story when a mother will teach her
Daughter that she ought to hate a perfect stranger
And how in the world can the words that I said
Send somebody so over the edge
That they'd write me a letter, sayin' that I better
Shut up and sing or my life will be over

I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
I'm not ready to make nice
I'm not ready to back down
I'm still mad as hell and I don't have time
To go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's too late to make it right
I probably wouldn't if I could
'Cause I'm mad as hell, can't bring myself
To do what it is you think I should
What it is you think I should

And cannon ball into the water

I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have
For you I will

Down the road ahead

The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind

But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead

You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes

I'm not asking you to turn back around

A part of me wants to leave you alone
A part of me wants for you to come home
A part of me says I'm living a lie
(And I'm better off without you)
A part of me says to think it through
A part of me says I'm over you
A part of me wants to say goodbye
A part of me is asking why...

A part of me wants to leave
But a part of me wants to be here with you
And every time I think that we're over and done you do something to get me back loving you
And you got me just torn

Torn in between the two (Oh yeah)

But something's telling me I should leave you alone

There were no issues when we started out
It was cool
It was everything that love's about
But something happened
Plus I'm feeling so burnt out
(cause I can't understand you now)
Now oh

A part of me says it's all my fault
A part of me says ""he ain't what you want""
A part of me says to get my bags
A part of me says I can't do that

648,2006,Paul Wall,Girl,"[Hook: sped-up sample of ""Oh Girl"" by the Chi-Lites]
Ohhh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Ohhhhhhhh girl, I'd be in trouble if you left me now
Cause I don't know where to look for love, I just don't know how
Ohhhh.. {*cut off and echoes*}

[Paul Wall]
It started off, we were two peas in the pod
Motivated by love with the blessings of God
We were head over heels in this love thang
Funny ain't it thinkin back, our friends thought it was just a fling
I used to call you on the phone, late night tip
Mackin to you in your ear, conversation well equipped
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
But all the while your roommates were in denial
We felt a lot of jealousy from the very start
Your so-called friends kept tryin to tear us apart
They used to tell you all kinda lies
Just like a wolf in sheep's clothing, the devil came in disguise
They transformed all your smiles into tears
To sabotage your happiness and blamed it on my busy career
I gave you e'rythang, aimin to please
But I guess it wasn't enough, cause now you ready to leave
But don't go baby
[Hook]

[Paul Wall - over Hook]
What it do baby, don't leave me hangin baby
I know you feelin this, I'm just sayin though
I know you hearin me, so don't do it baby
You know I keep it real, just let me tell you somethin

[Paul Wall]
Lil' momma been down with me for a while
When you tryin to smile I'm the one you like to dial
But lately I've been on a mission for commission
So while you at home wishin you was with me I've been missin
But listen I'm tryin to lace you up with diamonds that glisten
I got a vision so baby you need to kill all the fiction
Don't listen to what your friends sayin, they just jealous
Cause they on the sidelines watchin while you in the game playin
I'm just sayin you should be stayin, but I ain't trippin
I'm in love with my money baby that's how I'm livin
You know I got you on my mind like an edge-up
And all of your naggin me and whinin it got me fed up
I'm on the grind hustlin, stackin my cash
But you just thank I'm in the streets chasin after some ass
Tryin to break that bread, I'm tryin to get that cake
But you complainin talkin 'bout you fin' to skate, baby what it do
[Hook]

[Paul Wall]
I'm tryin to tell you 'bout your friends hatin
While they be over there complainin I'm just on my grind paper chasin
You got them insecure thoughts in your mind
But instead of chasin hoes I be overtime on my grind
You steady listenin to the gossip in the beauty shop
But all them jealous single females want what you got
They would do anythang to take yo' place
Cause everytime I come around they be givin me that sex face
You ridin shotgun in the James Bond Benz
With the frog-eyed lens on them 20 inch do rims
So why you worried about your jealous so-called friends
I'm just on my grind tryin to stack me up some ends baby
I used to make you laugh, I used to make you smile
And all the while your jealous friends been in denial
I ain't askin much, lil' momma just keep it real
Either you're down with me or not, baby what's the deal

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, Winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing, their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table

So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

May, he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But, my God, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table

So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

""There's a light at each end of this tunnel"" you shout
""'Cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you've made, you'll just make them again""
If you only try turning around

2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Got me thinkin' about how fragile life is
As I drove away
You know Amy was his only love
In a moment she was gone, long gone:
It could have been me or you

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you
Like it's the last day of my life

I drive off when the sun comes up:
I get back when it's gone down
There's so much I wanna do with you
But I can't be around
Whoa, time has been just like a thief
It's stolen too much from us
So once it's gone we can't make it up
So tonight, let's get back in touch
I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights
An' I'm gonna wrap my arms around you
An' rock you all through the night
An' I'm gonna love you

Life is a rainbow, it's a spring snow
It's the mornin' dew
An' I don't wanna waste another minute
Without you

So I'm gonna bring home a dozen roses
An' pour us a glass of wine
An' I'm gonna put on a little music
An' turn down the lights

An' rock you all through the night

18 years have come and gone
For mama they flew by
But for me they drug on and on
We were loading up that Chevy
Both trying not to cry
Mama kept on talking
Putting off good-bye
And she took my hand and said
""Baby, don't forget""

Before you hit the highway
You better stop for gas
There's a 50 in the ashtray
In case you run short on cash
Here's a map, and here's a Bible
If you ever lose your way

Just one more thing before you leave:
Don't forget to remember me

[Verse 3]
This downtown apartment sure makes me miss home
And those bills there on the counter
Keep telling me I'm on my own
And just like every Sunday, I called mama up last night
And even when it's not, I tell her everything's alright
Before we hung up, I said
""Hey mama, don't forget
[Chorus 2]
To tell my baby sister, I'll see her in the fall
And tell Meemaw that I miss her
Yeah, I should give her a call
And make sure you tell Daddy
That I'm still his little girl
Yeah, I still feel like I'm where I'm supposed to be
But don't forget to remember me""

I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry

Before I'll say ""I love you""?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?

I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?

Where all the children left without a trace
Only to come back, as pure as gold
To recite this all

If you're dreaming, are you dreaming of me?
I can't believe you actually picked me)

[Intro: Justin's Mother]
(”Hi Justin, this is your mother, and it's 2:33 on Monday afternoon
I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1: Justin Furstenfeld]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space
[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you

[Verse 2: Justin Furstenfeld]
I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicide and hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
[Bridge: Justin Furstenfeld]
And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make her smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Chorus: Justin Furstenfeld]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

With just a look, they shook, and heavens bowed before him
Simply a look can break your heart
The stars that pierce the sky, he left them all behind
We’re left to wonder why he left us all behind

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh

Dreams of his crash won’t pass, oh, how they all adored him
Beauty will last when spiraled down
The stars that mystify, he left them all behind
And how his children cried, ""He left us all behind!""

Hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I, hey (Hey!) Miss Murder, can I
Make (Hey!) beauty stay if I take my life? Ho-oh-oh...

What's the hook, the twist within this verbose mystery?
I would gladly bet my life upon it
That the ghost you love, your ray of light will fizzle out
Without hope
We're the empty set just floating through empty skin
Ever searching for what we were promised
Reaching for that golden ring, we'd never let go
But who would ever let us put our filthy hands upon it?

Who's to say what's impossible?
Well they forgot, this world keeps spinning
And with each new day
I can feel a change in everything
And as the surface breaks, reflections fade
But in some ways, they remain the same
And as my mind begins to spread its wings
There's no stopping curiosity

[Chorus]
I wanna turn the whole thing upside down
I'll find the things they say just can't be found
I'll share this love I find with everyone
We'll sing and dance to Mother Nature's songs
I don't want this feeling to go away

Who's to say I can't do everything?
Well I can try
And as I roll along I begin to find
Things aren't always just what they seem

I'll share this love I find with everyone

Are said too much
They're not enough

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life
[Verse 3]
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

[Bridge]
All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

672,2006,Keith Anderson,Every Time I Hear Your Name,"[Verse 1]
Finally got over that song of ours
Stopped chasin' little red sports cars
To check the license plates
And back wood drivin' by your place
Back makin' the rounds at our old haunts
Honky Tonks, restaurants
And seein' some of our old friends
It feels good to dance again
And I can finally smell your perfume
And not look around the room for you
And I can walk right by your picture in a frame
And not feel a thing, but when I hear your name

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
And nothing's change and we're still the same
And I get lost in the innocence of a first kiss
And I'm hanging onto every word running off of your lips
And that's all it takes and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Verse 2]
Got someone special in my life
Everyone thinks she'd make a great wife
Dad says he thinks she's the one
Reminds him of Mom when she was young
But it's way too soon to be talking 'bout rings
Don't wanna rush into anything
She's getting over someone too
Dinda like me and you
And she talks about him every once in a while
And I just nod my head an' smile
'Cause I know exactly what she's goin' through
Yeah, I've been there too
And when the conversation turns to you
[Chorus]
I get caught in a ""you were the only one for me""
Kinda thought, and your face is all that I see
I know I can't go back when I still go back
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And that's all it takes, and I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Bridge]
So I'm thinkin' 'bout the words I left unsaid
(Every time I hear your name)
Stop tryin' to change the things I can't change
(Every time I hear your name)
In my heart, I know you're gone, but in my head

[Chorus]
I feel rain falling right out of the blue sky
And it's the fifth of May and I'm right there staring in your eyes
That's all it takes and I'm in that place
And there we are, a point down by the riverside
And I'm in your arms about to make love for the first time
And I can't explain, but I'm in that place
Every time I hear your name

[Outro]
Every time I hear your name
(Every time I hear your name)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Every time I hear your name)
Ah ah, every time I hear your name"

Turn me inside out
Everything shines
But leaves me empty still
And I, I'll burn this lonely house down
If you run with me

The walls will fall before we do
So take my hand now
We'll run forever

I twist my fate
Just to feel you
But you, turn me toward the light
And you're one with me
Will you run with me?

The walls will fall before we do
So take my hand now

Hold, hold up, hold up
Slow, slow down
Listen, give me 10 minutes
Well, give me 5 minutes...a'ight
B-before you leave I just need these last 4 minutes

[Verse 1]
Pardon me if I'm talking fast and stumbling all over my words
I heard you were leavin' town
I thought I'd be the one to know first
If you have a minute let me talk to you and see what's going on
Don't say it's nothing
When it's gotta be something that's gone wrong
Now let me explain but I don't know what to say
'Cause I don't know what the hell happened
I come in the house to try to work it out
And all you're doing is packing
Close your suitcase let me think straight
Damn, what could be the reason
Baby talk to me I'm almost out of time

[Chorus]
I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do
To prove to you that I'm gon' do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay
And show you that I done changed
'Cause in 4 minutes
I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes
I'm a lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clock's ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go
[Verse 2]
Who are these people I don't know in my house?
And they scratching my floors
Takin' furniture outside and the U-Haul pull up to my door
What's the reason that I get this feelin'
That you can't keep it real with me?
Is it cause of the prior relationships I had off in the streets?
Never mind that this is your conscience speaking
And you need to get your girl back
You gotta find a way to try to get to her heart
I'm takin' suggestions I've learned my lesson
Think conscience you're my last lifeline
I'm down to my last second

I only got 4 minutes to do what I gotta do
To prove to you that I'm gon' do anything
Only got 4 minutes say what I gotta say to make you stay
And show you that I done changed

I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes
I'm a lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
I'm desperate cause the clock's ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

I've done things in my past
I thought this love would last
But I can't let you go baby
You're my everything lady
The reason I smile and the reason I talk baby
The reason I breathe
The only one for me, yeah
You can't go through with this
If you left me my life wouldn't exist
Cause I'm still in love with you
And that's my word I don't give a damn what you heard
Oh, baby I'll be true

[Chorus (variant)]
I only got 4 minutes
And I'm running out of time
I only got 4 minutes
I only got 4 minutes
4 minutes I'll never have my girl again
In 4 minutes I'm a lose her to some other man
4 no less no more
Cause the clocks ticking
Only got 4 minutes to go

Only got 4 minutes to tell you everything I love about you
4 minutes to say I need you, I can't live without you

You've got this new head filled up with smoke
And I've got my veins all tangled close

The safest place to hide
A long night spent with your most obvious weakness, you start shaking at the thought
You are everything I want
'Cause you are everything I'm not

Just not too close, too close

And it says ""You, oh, you are so cool""
Scissor-shaped across the bed
You are red, violent red
You hollow out my hungry eyes

It's a little too bad
You were too good to be true
I'm big time over you, baby

I'm big time over you, baby
It's a little too late

There was a time this heart of mine
Would take you back every time
Don't you know?
It's been two packs of cigarettes
A sleepless night, a nervous wreck, a day ago
Now you ain't got no business coming around
I'm closing up shop
Shutting us down

It's a little too late
I'm a little too gone
I'm a little too tired of just hanging on
So I'm letting go while I'm still strong enough to

Ya'll know what this is...So...So...Def!

[Verse 1: LL Cool J]
The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry (Woo!)
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me (Uh-huh!)
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her (Yeah!)
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit
I'm L, nice to meet ya (Uh-oh!)
I could feel my body yearning
The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle
I'm sweatin' just a little
On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled
She said
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself (Aww!)
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 2: LL Cool J with Jennifer Lopez]
Temptation is a mother
How we lust for one another (Yeah)
We barely know each other
Yet we're wilding like we're lovers
The air is full of passion
The strobe lights are flashin'
The hustlers throw cashin'
The bartender keeps splashin'
Her moves were so erotic
Her gaze was so hypnotic
I begged this girl to stop it
But she continued to pop it
You know I know you like it
Let me hit you on your Sidekick
Because the after party is at my body
Meet me you're invited
She said
[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man

What it takes to make this boy be bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
It's hard for me to control myself (Me too)
And to hold myself back from jumpin' on ya
Like I wanna, like I wanna, wanna

[Verse 3: LL Cool J]
She licked, off, her lip, gloss
Her hips, tossed, back, and forth
Side, to side, and up, and down
She touched, the ground, it turned, me out
I'm battling desire
Lord help me douse this fire
This internal inferno
Hotter than a shot of Cuervo
Her top was short and purple
Belly dancing in a circle
When I feel like this I can't resist
Stop it don't make me hurt you

She said

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & LL Cool J]
You got, you got, you got

What it takes to make this boy be bad

Oh, it's stuck? Then I'll take the whole finger than, man
And let me get those bags from Paris
And the puppies is staying, yo

He probably did, you swallow his kids?
In and out of jail, he a snail, he wasn't wilding on bids
In the summertime, I broke his jaw
Had to do it to him quick, old fashioned, in the back of the mall
Me and him had 'mos forever
Like I'm 'posed to put him on when he came home and told on Trevor
Had to bang on homie, ear blocks, out in spots
Throwing them shots, like, ""Nigga, you know me""
Stop fronting for them niggas outside like you really ride
And you a silly chick, thought you was really live
But I guess I was wrong, I'ma holla at dog
And rip his head off, word, yo, it's on

All them kisses and love yous, when jake came, you hid my packs
It was time a nigga went to war
Vest banged up, standin' in the kitchen, yo, holding a four
Sweatin' and breathing, bounced out of town for a weekend
Heard you had homie in the passenger seatin'
Honey, look, I'm a monster don
I do monster things, that's why I put your ass under my arm
Fuckin' with him can bring bodily harm
And where you gon' hide in the streets when the body is gone?
If it's one thing I learned that
Never trust a female on no scale, you just confirmed that
Bounce to your mama house, pack your shit
I don't care if you crying, you's a ruthless chick
Gots to watch you, these eyeballs in my face'll spot you
My girl cousins, they gon' rock you
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Uh-huh)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Told you)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (I'm a good dude, you see?)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Yeah)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Wanna play games, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no

[Bridge: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Shorty, what is you thinkin' 'bout? ('Bout)
Didn't I put you down?
Flyest whips
Rollin' round like, ""Yeah, that's the boss' chick""
On the side I might of had (Had), one or two (Two)
But them silly broads wasn't nothing on you
Rolling with him, tryna get revenge
That shit, you just don't do (Uh)

[Chorus: Ne-Yo & Ghostface Killah]
Come through the block in his brand new Benz
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Yeah, you see? Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (This for the knucklehead)
But you don't get a nigga back like that (Females out there that wanna be)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Actin' like they gettin' they little revenge off)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (Okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack (Takin' it further than what it really is, you know what I mean?)
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (Playin' yourself)
Come through the block in his brand new Benz (Know what I mean?)
Knowing that me and that nigga ain't friends (Okay, girl, this is don status, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that (You gon' have to hold that now)
Bouncin' around when I'm up in these streets (Word up, and when I see money)
Knowing that me and that nigga got beef (I'ma hang him upside-down, it's on, okay, girl)
Yeah, what I did was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that, no (And not because of you, neither, you know? Believe that)

In the tub or on the sink, I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love (Ha Ha)
[Verse 2: Olivia]
You said that I could call you whenever I needed someone to listen to me
That's why I'm here standin' by your side cause you always come through for me

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate, come on
[Verse 4: Olivia]
I'm not afraid to explore my body - oooh, gimme that feelin
Now we can watch some TV or play a CD; baby that sexual healin'

683,2006,Gary Allan,Life Ain't Always Beautiful,"Life ain't always beautiful
Sometimes it's just plain hard
Life can knock you down, it can break your heart

Life ain't always beautiful
You think you're on your way
And it's just a dead end road at the end of the day

But the struggle makes you stronger
And the changes make you wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time

No, life ain't always beautiful
Tears will fall sometimes
Life ain't always beautiful, but it's a beautiful ride

Life ain't always beautiful
Some days I miss your smile
I get tired of walkin' all these lonely miles

And I wish for just one minute
I could see your pretty face
Guess I can dream, but life don't work that way

But the struggles makes me stronger
And the changes make me wise
And happiness has its own way of takin' its sweet time
No, life ain't always beautiful
But I know I'll be fine
Hey, life ain't always beautiful, but its a beautiful ride
What a beautiful ride"

Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

[Verse 1]
Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Droppin' names)
What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of two or three
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees

[Pre-Chorus]
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Push up my bra like that, I don't wanna be a stupid girl

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore!
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see (Come on)

Ooh. Jesus Christ had dreads, so shake em
I ain't got none, but I'm planning on growing some
Imagine all the Hebrews going dumb
Dancing on top of chariots and turning tight ones
Ooh, tell me when to go (dumb)
Talking on my Ghettro on the way to the store
My second or third trip
Some Henny, some Swishers and some Listerine strips
Dr. Greenthumb lips, just to ease my thoughts
Not just the cops, but the homies you got to watch
The moon is full, look at the dark clouds
Sitting in my scraper, watching Oakland Gone Wild, ta-dow
I don't bump mainstream, I knock underground
All that other shit, sugarcoated and watered down
I'm from the Bay where we hyphy and go dumb
From the soil where them rappers be getting their lingo from

From the Bay to the A
Put me in a Backwood, Swisher sweet blunt, orange lace
(Let's go, it's dope) It's just some shit I wrote
My city couldn't be saved by John the Pope (John the Pope)
I slid past on the gas with the bitches at me
It's good, it's good like the granddaddy
Cross game, you get flipped like a burger patty
Or zig-zagged, pass me a big old fatty
I drink white, with a snow bunny
Talking big shit in the scraper, going hella dummy

687,2006,George Strait,The Seashores Of Old Mexico,"[Verse 1]
I left, out of Tucson, with no destination in mind
I was running from trouble and the jail-term the Judge had in mind
And the border meant freedom, a new life, romance
And that's why I thought I should go
And start my life over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 2]
My first night in Juarez, lost all the money I had
One bad senorita made use of one innocent lad
But I must keep on running; it's too late to turn back
I'm wanted in Tucson, I'm told
Yeah, and things'll blow over on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 3]
Two Mexican farmers en route to a town I can't say
Let me ride on the back of a flatbed half-loaded with hay
Down through Durango, Colima, Almiera
Then in the Manzanillos
Where I slept on the seashores of old Mexico

[Verse 4]
After one long siesta, I came wide awake in the night
I was startled by someone who shadowed the pale moonlight
My new-found companion, one young senorita
Who offered a broken hello
To the gringo she found on the seashores of old Mexico
[Verse 5]
She spoke of Sonora and swore that she'd never return
For her Mexican husband, she really had no great concern
Cause she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

[Outro]
Yeah, she loved the gringo, my red hair and lingo
That's all I needed to know, ha, ha
Yeah, I found what I needed on the seashores of old Mexico

Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say, ""sit down, it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And I pray to God He hears you, and
[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night

Hopscotch, when I'm on the E-way
You see me hit it then I'm gone, shinin' red paint and I touch that whistle
Silicone I stay deep (stay deep) hopin' at all cause I don't mind
Cause I'm wood grippin', flip switchin'
Flipping alpine, it's pimpin' nigga

692,2006,Jack Ingram,Wherever You Are,"This desert wind is burnin' my face again
God I'm missin' you
Been runnin' blind under a broken sky
With regrets I was sorting through
But lesson learned baby
I've made the turn

Wherever you are
No matter how far
Girl I'm gonna find my way to you
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are

So many miles to where we said goodbye
To the street of shattered dreams
I'm prayin' hard you didn't start a life
With someone who's not me
And if you're just gone
Girl I'll be movin' on

(Chorus)
Let the sunrise find me searchin'
Let the west wind carry my plea
Give this changed man one more last chance
Open your arms to me
Wherever you are
Through rivers of rain
Over mountains of pain
Do whatever on earth I've gotta do
I'll follow the dream I'll follow my heart
Girl I've gotta be
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are"

We made a vow to love through it all
We are one
And no one has the right to tear my love down

That a love like ours won't last?

Ain't gonna never ever leave you alone

The sun lights the world when it shines
The midnight sky has a blanket of stars and a moon
And baby I got you

I can't imagine one day without you in it
Life alone just wouldn't be worth livin'
Love would be a wish that never came true
Lord knows I've got more than I deserve
But I don't question the prayer that I've had ansered
I did something right cause
Baby I got you

Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk, forget what we did

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'ma buy you a drank
And then I'ma take you home with me

One fifty a shot, three for you and three for me
I'm checking your body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now were both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in your ear, your legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'ma let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

I'ma buy you a drank, woah, oh-ooh, woah

704,2007,Daughtry,Home,"[Verse 1]
I'm staring out into the night
Trying to hide the pain
I'm going to the place where love
And feeling good don't ever cost a thing
And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain

[Chorus]
Well, I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
So, I'm going home
Well, I'm going home

[Verse 2]
The miles are getting longer, it seems
The closer I get to you
I've not always been the best man or friend for you
But your love remains true
And I don't know why
You always seem to give me another try
[Chorus]
So, I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you've got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old

[Bridge]
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all
And then some you don't want
Be careful what you wish for
'Cause you just might get it all
You just might get it all, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm going home
To the place where I belong
And where your love has always been enough for me
I'm not running from
No, I think you got me all wrong
I don't regret this life I chose for me
But these places and these faces are getting old
I said, these places and these faces are getting old
So, I'm going home
Well, I'm going home"

I hope the ring you gave to her turns her finger green
I hope when you're in bed with her, you think of me
I would never wish bad things, but I don't wish you well
Could you tell, by the flames that burned your words?

[Pre-Chorus]
I never read your letter
'Cause I knew what you'd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all ok

[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
She may believe you, but I never will
Never again

[Verse 2]
If she really knows the truth, she deserves you
A trophy wife, oh, how cute
Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes, and he's through with you
And he'll be through with you
You'll die together, but alone
[Pre-Chorus]
You wrote me in a letter
You couldn't say it right to my face
Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

[Chorus]
Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
Never again

[Bridge]
Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never
Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt to know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks, see my face everywhere
It was you, who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew exactly what you would do
And don't say, you simply lost your way
They may believe you, but I never will
I never will, I never will, never again"

And I ain't tryin put you out thurr, as if you a freak

If you a balla, pull a stack out, and slap her on da ayyy!
Pop lockin cock blockas, get up out da way
Let lil' mami get low, give a space, let her sweat
The club turnin to hoolas cause they shirts is so wet
From da window to da wall, lil' mama showin her thong
The broad, freakin herself, it's tellin me that it's on
You ready then we can roll I'm tellin you we can go
I'm thinkin if I can handle it the way you make it roll
You groovin and speedin up, you right in between us
If you a strip-teaser, then baby don't tease us
At first I thought I was trippin but my vision gettin clearer
You movin that thang around as if you practice in the mirror
""She doin a new, dance,"" what the next man said
I'm like, ""Naw, she just pop lockin on a headstand""

Love my ass and my abs in the video called ""Promiscuous""
My style is ri-dic-dic-diculous—'ulous—'ulous

Wanna see you work your body

When Timbo' is in the party, everybody put up they hands
I get a half a mil' for my beats, you get a couple gra-a-and
Never gon' see the day that I ain't got the upper hand
I'm respected from Californ-I-A way down to Japan
I'm a real producer, and you just a piano man
Your songs don't top the charts—I heard 'em, I'm not a fa-a-an
Niggas talkin' greasy, I'm the one that gave them they chance
Somebody need to tell 'em that they can't do it like I can

If you see us on the floor, you'll be watchin' all night

Wanna see you work your body

Could you speak up and stop mu-mumbling?
I don't think you came in clear
When you're sittin' on the top
It's hard to hear you from way up here
Now I saw you tryna act cute on TV
""Just let me clear the air...""
We missed you on the charts last week—
Damn, that's right, you wasn't there
Now if se-sexy never left, then why is everybody on my shi-i-it?
Don't hate on me just because you didn't come up with it
So if you see us in the club, go on and walk the other way
'Cause our run will never be over—not, at least, until we say (Ugh)

Right now, he's probably slow dancing
With a bleached-blond tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now, he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot a whiskey
Right now, he's probably up behind her with a pool-stick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know

[Chorus]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Verse 2]
Right now, she's probably up singing some
White-trash version of Shania karaoke
Right now, she's probably saying, ""I'm drunk""
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now, he's probably dabbing on
Three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
Oh, and he don't know
[Chorus]
Oh, that I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats

[Bridge]
I might've saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh, you know it won't be on me
No, not on me

'Cause I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires

Oh, maybe next time, he'll think before he cheats
Oh, before he cheats

Bone Thugs, Akon, yeah
You know, don't nothin' come easy
You gotta try real real hard
I've tried hard
But I guess I gotta try harder

[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 1: Krayzie Bone]
First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the dark side
So I'm havin' a hard time stayin' on track, man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin' yet
Been in and out of relationships
So I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complications at
But I'm layin' back, prayin' that
You give that peace of mind to me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin' my dreams
And then it seem when the fame and cash came
They just got me goin' crazy-y-y, lately
I've been so faded tryin' to erase it
But I just can't ‘cause the drama just grows greater
And I've been in so many collisions by puttin' shit off 'til later
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
It's like I'm takin' five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin' to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin' away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?
And uh, I just don't know but I be out here fightin' demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord, would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflictin' on my family?
Hustlin' and gamblin', trickin' and scramblin'
And losin' sight of what I'm supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage ‘cause everyday's a challenge
And man, I'm slippin', can't lose my balance, I'm tryin' not to panic
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I
Try to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard
Hopin' one day you'll come and rescue me
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here: rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up
Right here with my heat, gettin' dough

[Verse 3: Wish Bone]
I see that things won't change
I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out it keeps pullin' me back, mane
Got me doin' dirty dirt
So used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no 9-to-5 work
Studied on the streets, hustlas know what I mean
Hustlas ballin' before us
I'm tryin' to make it to that major league
So we will never leave until the sun came up
Gotta get it—no, nope, not leavin' no budge
Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then it's all on you
Gotta watch what you sign to
Try so hard but I won't pull through
[Hook: Akon]
I tried so hard
Can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard
Will always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault ‘cause I

There was a time
I packed my dreams away
Living in a shell
Hiding from myself
There was a time
When I was so afraid
I thought I'd reached the end
Baby, that was then
I am made of more than my yesterdays

[Chorus]
This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

[Verse 2]
I had to decide
Was I gonna play it safe?
Well, but somewhere deep inside
I tried to turn the tide
And find the strength o take that step of faith

This is my now
And I am breathing in the moment
As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then
This is my now

And I have a courage
Like never before, yeah
I settled for less
But I'm ready for more
Ready for more

As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt
That was then

As I look around
I can't believe the love I see
My fears behind me
Gone are the shadows and doubt

Wear them gold and diamond rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines, shopping for expensive things
I be on the movie screens, magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine
I still go to Taco Bell, drive-thru, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell
After the show or after the Grammy's
I like to go cool out with the family
Sipping, reminiscing on days when I had a Mustang
And now I'm...

Telling me these crazy things that I don't wanna know (Fuck y'all)

All the fans I'd like to thank, thank you, really though
'Cause I remember yesterday, when I dreamt about them days
When I'd rock on MTV, that'd be really dope

Better put your fingers back to the keys...

There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret

While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night (Yeah), I couldn't even get an answer (Didn't get an answer, baby)
(Oh) I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Oh, couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby, oh)

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
I need you and you need me (I need you)
This is so plain to see
And I would never let you go
And I will always love you so, I will
If you could only see, your heart belongs to me (Belongs to me)
I love you so much (So, so), I'm yearning for your touch
Come and set me free, forever yours, I'll be
Baby, won't you come and take my pain away?

[Chorus: Diddy & (Keyshia Cole)]
Last night, I couldn't even get an answer (I couldn't get you, baby, yeah, oh)
I tried to call (Call me, baby), but my pride wouldn't let me dial
(Why couldn't you just dial me, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby?)
And I'm sitting here with this blank expression (Don't sit there, no)
And the way I feel (Alright, yeah), I wanna curl up like a child
(I'm so alone, I'm so lonely, baby)
[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
And call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you
Why don't you pick up the phone and dial up my number?
Just call me up, baby, I'm waiting on you

[Outro: Diddy]
{Phone dialing and ringing}
""Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That shit ain't funny not picking up the motherfucking phone
Better stop fucking playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you, right?
But for them couple of seconds though
When I couldn't get in touch with you
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better fucking not be there when I get over that house
{Laughing}
That's really how it goes down, right?"""
725,2007,Mims,This Is Why I'm Hot,"[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 1]
This is why I'm hot: I don't gotta rap
I could sell a mill sayin' nothin' on the track
I represent New York, I got it on my back
Niggas say that we lost it so I'ma bring it back
I love the Dirty Dirty 'cause niggas show me love
The ladies start to bounce as soon as I hit the club
But in the Midwest, they love to take it slow
So when I hit the H, I watch 'em get it on the flo'
And if you need it hyphy, I take it to the Bay
'Frisco to Sac-Town, they do it erryday
Compton to Hollywood, soon as I hit L.A
I'm in the low-low, I do it the Cali way (woo!)
And when I hit the Chi, people say that I'm fly
They love the way I dress, they like my attire
They love how I move crowds from side-to-side
They ask me how I do it and simply I reply
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 2]
This is why I'm hot, catch me on the block
Every other day, another bitch, another drop
Sixteen bars, twenty-four a pop
Forty-four a song, nigga, gimme what you got
I'm into drivin' cars, fresh up off the lot
I'm into shuttin' stores down just so I could shop
If you need a bird, I could get it chopped
Tell me whachu need, you know I get 'em by the flock
I call my homie Black, meet me on the Ave
I hit Wash Heights wit' the money in the bag
We into big spendin', see, my pimpin' never drag
Find me with different women that you niggas never had
For those who say they know me, know I'm focused on my cream
Player, you come between, you better focus on the beam
I keep it so mean, the way you seen me lean
And when I say I'm hot, my nigga, this is what I mean
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

[Verse 3]
This is why I'm hot, shorty see the drop
Asked me what I paid and I say ""Yeah, I paid a guap""
And then I hit the switch that take away the top
So chicks around the way, they call me Cream of the Crop
They hop in the car, I tell 'em ""All aboard""
We hit the studio, they say they like how I record
I gave 'em Black Train and I Did You Wrong
So every time I see them, man, they tell me that's they song
They say I'm the bomb, they love the way the charm
Hangin' from the neck and compliments the arm
Which compliments the ear, then comes the gear (Woo!)
So when I hit the room, the shorties stop and stare (Ha!)
Niggas start to hate, rearrange they face
But, little do they know, I keep them things by waist side
I reply ""Nobody got to die""
Similar to Lil Weez 'cause I got the fire
[Chorus]
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hot!) (Yeah!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Huh!)
This is why I'm hot (Hot!), this is why I'm hot (Hoo!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)"

Hey there, Delilah, what's it like in New York City?
I'm a thousand miles away, but girl, tonight, you look so pretty, yes you do
Times Square can't shine as bright as you
I swear it's true
Hey there, Delilah, don't you worry about the distance
I'm right there if you get lonely, give this song another listen, close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
What you do to me

[Verse 2]
Hey there, Delilah, I know times are getting hard
But just believe me, girl, someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar, we'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there, Delilah, I've got so much left to say
If every simple song I wrote to you would take your breath away, I'd write it all
Even more in love with me, you'd fall
We'd have it all
[Chorus]
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

[Bridge]
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes, and trains, and cars
I'd walk to you if I had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because
We know that none of them have felt this way
Delilah, I can promise you
That by the time we get through
The world will never, ever be the same
And you're to blame

[Verse 3]
Hey there, Delilah, you be good and don't you miss me
Two more years and you'll be done with school and I'll be making history like I do
You'll know it's all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you
This one's for you

Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me
Oh, it's what you do to me

Mbabarara, mbabarara
Mbabarara, mbabarara, mbabarara

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
It's been a while since we talked last
And I'm tryin' hard not to talk fast
But Dad, I'm finally thinkin' I may have found the one
Type of girl that'll make you way proud of your son
And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love it when she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

[Bridge: Travie McCoy]
She's got a smile that'll make the most senile
Annoying old man bite his tongue (I'm not done)
She's got eyes comparable to sunrise
And it doesn't stop there (Man, I swear)
She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component
Call it dumb, call it luck, call it love
Or whatever you call it, but
Everywhere I go I keep her picture in my wallet like
[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)
Take a look at my girlfriend
She's the only one I got (Mbabarara)
Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)"

Oooooh, Damn!
I mean I just keep thinkin about you (awww baby)
I mean I wanna move on but I can't move on (oh, oh, oh, ooooh)
It's like you got some kind of hold on me
And I don't know
But I'm a go ahead and talk about it
Listen

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I'm sitting looking out the window like damn
Trying to fix this situation that's at hand
You still running through my mind - when I'm knowing that you shouldn't be
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowing that it couldn't be
Cause you ain't called, and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lot of pain, I ain't dealt with it all
I been running 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they loving it
I'm liking it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
That's not the end of it - I'm trying to let you go
I can't get a grip of it, is what I'm trying to let you know
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
I'm working at it and it ain't getting no better
Just trying to be like ""yeah, forget it, whatever""
Instead of staring out this glass - looking at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...
[Hook: T-Pain]
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick, out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
I'm too attached my heart want let me fall back
I got it bad that's what you can call that (ah)
And when I see you in the streets that's the worse for me
Use to love the little things you did, that's what works for me
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doing?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas telling me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm trying man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leaving with the hot shots
Knowing they just want me cause I'm the top spot
That's not popping, and my brain ain't stopping
Thinking who she with? Or where she going? Is she club hopping?
I never had this kinda problem in my life
This is my first time dealing with this kind of fight
It's every night, and every flight, and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right....cause
When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system

[Hook: Bow Wow]
Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day - can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way
You been running through my mind all day  can you feel me
I been trying to get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me

When I'm with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When I'm all alone - that's all I wanna do
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick out of town visits
All the time we spent together, makes it hard to get you outta my system
You know what you do to me (do to me)  you don't even understand
Damn  you know what you do to me (do to me)
It's so hard to get you outta my system
[Hook: Bow Wow]
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
But I guess I gotta move on right?
Still hard, and I still love until this day... Peace"

What could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You've taken away everything
And I can't deal with that

Well, I'll try to do it right this time around

Can't let it bring us down

Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

I never felt nothing in the world like this before
Now I'm missing you, and I'm wishing you would come back through my door
Oh, why did you have to go? You could have let me know
So now, I'm all alone
Girl, you could have stayed, but you wouldn't give me a chance
With you not around, it's a little bit more than I can stand
Oh, and all my tears, they keep runnin' down my face
Why did you turn away?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you keep inside
This is not how you want it to be

[Chorus]
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Been a long time since you called me
(How could you forget about me?)
You gotta be feeling crazy
How can you walk away? Everything stays the same
I just can't do it, baby
What will it take to make you come back?
Girl, I told you what it is, and it just ain't like that
Why can't you look at me? You're still in love with me
Don't leave me crying

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, why can't we just, just start over again
Get it back to the way it was?
If you give me a chance, I can love you right
But you're telling me it won't be enough

[Chorus]
So, baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
[Pre-Chorus 1]
So why does your pride make you run and hide?
Are you that afraid of me?
But I know it's a lie, what you're keeping inside
This is not how you want it to be

[Bridge]
Baby, I will wait for you
Baby, I will wait for you, if it's the last thing I do

[Chorus]
Baby, I will wait for you
'Cause I don't know what else I can do
Don't tell me I ran out of time
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby, I will wait for you
If you think I'm fine, it just ain't true
I really need you in my life
No matter what I have to do, I'll wait for you
I'll be waiting"

Konvict Music (We The Best!)
Ay, ay, Grand Hustle
Yeah (We takin' over)
Ay, ay, ay
Oww! (Listen!)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Started in Atlanta then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, three-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock four-fifth, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said, ""I'll get it""
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Boss, it's what I does
I get money e'ryday, e'ryday I does
That (Benz) is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes and ride
You better (Move) AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my neck
I'm big like Diddy; damn it, I'm with it
Khaled, we did it, Biggie of my city
Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous
Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Yeah, they see it but no one reports it
I run this, Rick Ross, boss shit
[Chorus: Akon & DJ Khaled]
'Cause we takin' over (One city at a time)
Said we takin' over (One city at a time)

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
Like the MAC got a EZ pass, nigga what?
Shit, I don't give a fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I walk that beef
I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga OD
Cash rule everything around me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on Ds
Feelin' like Pac, all eyes on me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees (Trees, trees)
Nigga please
I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say ""Khaled,"" some say ""Khaleed""
Twelve years down and I'm finally free

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Birdman daddy, I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some
Spent that corner, he didn't run
Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist-wear Chopard but the Müller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big kahuna, y'dig?

Confusing stars for satellites

If everyone shared and swallowed their pride

Amen, I, Amen, I, Amen, I

I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

While lookin’ through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were lookin’ for
If there’s one memory I don’t wanna lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room

I told myself I won’t miss you
But I remembered
What it feels like beside you

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

The bed I’m lyin’ is getting colder
Wish I never would’ve said it’s over
And I can’t pretend
I won’t think about you when I’m older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can’t be the end

[Chorus]
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me

Hey girl, you know you drive me crazy
One look puts the rhythm in my hand
Still, I'll never understand why you hang around
I see what's going down
Cover up with makeup in the mirror
Tell yourself, ""It's never gonna happen again""
You cry alone, and then
He swears he loves you

[Chorus]
Do you feel like a man when you push her around?
Do you feel better now, as she falls to the ground?
Well, I'll tell you my friend, one day this world's going to end
As your lies crumble down, a new life she has found

A pebble in the water makes a ripple effect
Every action in this world'll bear a consequence
If you wade around forever, you will surely drown
I see what's going down

I see the way you go and say you're right again
Say you're right again, heed my lecture

Every time you take a sip
In this smoky atmosphere
You press that bottle to your lips
And I wish I was your beer

[Verse 2]
And in the small there of your back
Your jeans are playing peekaboo
I'd like to see the other half
Of your butterfly tattoo

[Bridge]
Hey that gives me an idea
Let's get out of this bar
Drive out into the country
And find a place to park

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks
[Verse 3]
I know the perfect little path
Out in these woods I used to hunt
Don't worry babe I've got your back
And I've also got your front

[Verse 4]
Now, I'd hate to waste a night like this
I'll keep you safe you wait and see
The only thing allowed to crawl all over you
When we get there is me

[Bridge]
You know every guy in here tonight
Would like to take you home
But I've got way more class than them
Babe that ain't what I want

[Chorus]
Cause I'd like to see you
Out in the moonlight
I'd like to kiss you
Way back in the sticks
I'd like to walk you
Through a field of wildflowers
And I'd like to check you for ticks

Now, ooo
You never know where one might be
But, ooo
There's lots of place that are hard to reach

When your will is broken
When it slips from your hand
When there's no time for jokin'
There's a hole in the plan

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

Know that I am alive
And all of what I feel (Feel)
I could show (Show you) you tonight, you tonight

Oh, you could mean everything to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

From my hands I could give you
Something that I made
From my mouth, I could sing you another brick that I laid
From my body (From my body), I could show you (I could show you)

You should know the space is holy (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Do you really wanna go?

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...
[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

I fake a smile so he won't see"
746,2007,Billy Currington,Good Directions,"[Verse 1]
I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me
[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

[Outro]
Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens"

We are the real

And just because
We are the real

I want to love you when you're sad

Get out, I'll take your place then
Can't stand the blazing sun?
Then close your eyes you'll see

A million watts of sound can't compare
Come along you'll see the world
The pulse ripples, the crowd unfurls
The current starts to flow and then you're on
Oh it's white hot soul they want
To sing for

We are the real
If real ever was
And just because
We are the ruin
Of every living soul
We are surreal
'Cause someone gave us up

Don't break the oath
I want to love you when you're happy
Don't break this oath
I want to be there when you're sad

We are the real
As real as any ghost
So easy now
We are the real

Can't stand the blazing sun?
Can't stand the morning rain?
Oh get out I'll take your place again

And from them dudes who be jealous of a chick wit' dough
Pop another bottle for them, keep my life movin'

755,2007,Emerson Drive,Moments,"[Verse 1:]
I was coming to the end of a long, long walk
When a man crawled out of a cardboard box
Under the E Street Bridge
Followed me on to it
I went out halfway across
With that homeless shadow tagging along
So I dug for some change
Wouldn't need it anyway
He took it lookin' just a bit ashamed
He said, You know, I haven't always been this way

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Verse 2:]
I stood there tryin' to find my nerve
Wondering if a single soul on Earth
Would care at all
Miss me when I'm gone
That old man just kept hanging around
Lookin' at me, lookin' down
I think he recognized
That look in my eyes
Standing with him there I felt ashamed
I said, You know, I haven't always been this way
[Chorus]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that plane ride coming home from the war
That summer my son was born
And memories like a coat so warm
A cold wind can't get through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
But I've had my moments

[Bridge:]
I know somewhere 'round a trashcan fire tonight
That old man tells his story one more time
He says

[Chorus:]
I've had my moments, days in the sun
Moments I was second to none
Moments when I knew I did what I thought I couldn't do
Like that cool night on the E. Street Bridge
When a young man almost ended it
I was right there, wasn't scared a bit
And I helped to pull him through
Lookin' at me now you might not know it
Oh, lookin' at me now you might not know it

756,2007,Dashboard Confessional,Stolen,"[Verse 1]
We watch the season pull up its own stakes
And catch the last weekend of the last week
Before the gold and the glimmer have been replaced
Another sun soaked season fades away

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 2]
Invitation-only grand farewells
Crash the best one of the best ones
Clear liquor and cloudy eyed
Too early to say goodnight

[Chorus]
You have stolen my heart
You have stolen my heart

[Verse 3]
And from the ballroom floor, we are in celebration
One good stretch before our hibernation
Our dreams assured, and we all will sleep well
Sleep well, sleep well, sleep well, sleep well
[Chorus 2]
You have stolen, you have stolen
You have stolen my heart

[Bridge]
I watch you spin around in your highest heels
You are the best one of the best ones
And we all look like we feel

[Chorus 2]
You have stolen my, you have stolen my
You have stolen my heart"
757,2007,Carrie Underwood,Wasted,"[Verse 1]
Standin' at the back door
She tried to make it fast
One tear hit the hardwood
It fell like broken glass
She said sometimes love slips away
And you just can’t get it back
Let’s face it
For one split second
She almost turned around
But that would be like pouring raindrops
Back into a cloud
So she took another step
And said, ""I see the way out and I'm gonna take it""

[Chorus]
I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted

[Verse 2]
Another glass of whiskey, but it still don't kill the pain
So he stumbles to the sink and pours it down the drain
He said, ""It's time to be a man and stop living for yesterday
Gotta face it""
[Chorus]
'Cause I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted

[Bridge]
She kept driving along
Till the moon and the sun were floatin' side-by-side
He looked in the mirror and his eyes were clear
For the first time in a while
Hey, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time
Wasted
Oh, I don't wanna spend my life jaded
Waitin' to wake up one day and find
That I let all these years go by
Wasted
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I don't wanna keep on wishin', missin'
The still of the morning, the color of the night
I ain't spendin' no more time

758,2007,Fantasia,When I See U,"[Verse 1]
I put your picture on my mirror
Start to blush when somebody says your name
In my stomach there's a pain
See you walk in my direction
I go the other way
I start to stutter when I speak
Try to stand but my knees go weak
What's happening to me?
Anybody can you tell me what it means?
I lay my head on my pillow
Staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
Is this the reason why

[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

[Verse 2]
I scribble X's and O's in my notebook
Checking how my hair and nails look
I feel myself in the zone
I get nervous when you call
So I say I'm not home
I see your face
When I hear my favorite song
Should I send a email at home
You're the number one topic on the phone
I wonder if you know or do you have a clue?
I lay my head on my pillow
You got me staring out the window
Wish on a star for a sign
What's the reason why?
Yeah
[Chorus]
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you

Something now is taking over me
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm not gonna run
I'm, just gonna stand here and see
Ooooo, yeah

You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you
You're always on my mind
When you come around, I get shy
When I see you, when I see you
Never know when you might walk by
So I gotta be right on time
When I see you, when I see you"
759,2007,Papa Roach,Forever,"[Verse 1]
In the brightest hour of my darkest day
I realized what is wrong with me
Can't get over you, can't get through to you
It's been a helter-skelter romance from the start
Take these memories that are haunting me
Of a paper man cut into shreds
By his own pair of scissors
He'll never forgive her, he'll never forgive her

[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Verse 2]
Sitting by a fire on a lonely night
Hanging over from another good time
With another girl, little dirty girl
You should listen to this story of a life
You're my heroin
In this moment, I'm lonely, fulfilling my darkest dreams
All these drugs, all these women
I'm never forgiven, this broken heart of mine
[Chorus]
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

[Bridge]
One last kiss
Before I go
Dry your tears
It is time to let you go
One last kiss (one last kiss)
Before I go (before I go)
Dry your tears (dry your tears)
It is time to let you go

Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever
Because days come and go
But my feelings for you are forever

I don't know what they're talking about
I'm making my own decisions
This thing that I found ain't gonna bring me down
I'm like a junkie without an addiction
Mama, don't cry, I just wanna stay high
I like playing with danger and fear
Everybody's walking, but nobody's talking
It looks a lot better from here

[Hook]
All my life I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop
All fired up I'm gonna go 'till I drop
You're either in or in the way, don't make me, I don't wanna stop

[Verse 2]
Why don't they ever listen to me?
It's just a one-way conversation
Nothing they say is gonna set me free
Don't need no mental masturbation
Too many religions, but only one God
I don't need another savior
Don't try to change my mind
You know I'm one of a kind
Ain't gonna change my bad behavior

All my life, I've been over the top
I don't know what I'm doing, all I know is I don't wanna stop

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere
Or get yourself in a bind, lose the shirt off your back
Need a floor, need a couch, need a bus fare

This is where the rubber meets the road
This is where the cream is gonna rise
This is what you really didn't know
This is where the truth don't lie

[Chorus]
You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""
They just show on up
With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

Everybody wants to slap your back, wants to shake your hand
When you're up on top of that mountain
But let one of those rocks give way, then you slide back down
Look up and see who's around then

This ain't where the road comes to an end
This ain't where the bandwagon stops
This is just one of those times when
A lot of folks jump off

Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""
Or ""It's way too far""

With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are

When the water's high
When the weather's not so fair
When the well runs dry
Who's gonna be there?

You find out who your friends are
Somebody's gonna drop everything
Run out and crank up their car
Hit the gas, get there fast
Never stop to think ""What's in it for me?""

With their big old heart
You find out who your friends are, yeah
You find out who your friends are

Run your car off the side of the road
Get stuck in a ditch way out in the middle of nowhere

She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had

Then come loving up on her
Give a little, then take it back
She'd tell him about her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry
""You're crazy for believing
You'll ever leave the ground""
He said, ""Only angels know how to fly""

She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man, you ought to see her fly

She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowin' in the breeze

It's goodbye
But we got one more night
Lets get drunk and ride around
And make peace with an empty town
We can make it right

Throw it away
Forget yesterday
We'll make the great escape
And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway
Watch it burn
Let it die
'Cause we are finally free tonight

Tonight will change our lives
It's so good to be by your side, but we'll cry
We won't give up the fight
We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs
And they'll think it's just 'cause we're young
And we'll feel so alive

And we won't hear a word they say
They don't know us anyway

When I'm out in N.Y., boy, it's blunts and Phillies
When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers
Now Blood walk to this, now Crip walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

[Verse 1]
I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this
(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

[Verse 2]
I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

I'm laughing straight to the bank with this

Now work it out now, shorty work it out
I wanna see you, break it down

Let your clarity define you;

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, then you stand

[Verse 2]
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out
The edge of a canyon with only one way down
Take what you're given before it's gone
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand
[Bridge]
Every time you get up
And get back in the race
One more small piece of you
Starts to fall into place, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause when push comes to shove
You taste what you're made of
You might bend 'til you break
'Cause it's all you can take
On your knees you look up
Decide you've had enough
You get mad, you get strong
Wipe your hands, shake it off
Yeah, then you stand
Yeah, baby
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Woo hoo, woo hoo
Then you stand, yeah yeah"
771,2007,Montgomery Gentry,Lucky Man,"[Verse 1]
I have days where I hate my job
This little town and the whole world too
And last Sunday when my Bengals lost
Lord, it put me in a bad mood
I have moments when I curse the rain
But then complain when the sun's too hot
I look around at what everyone has
And I forget about all I've got

[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kid's dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Verse 2]
Got some friends who would be here fast
I could call 'em any time of day
Got a brother who's got my back
Got a mama who I swear's a saint
Got a brand new rod and reel
Got a full week off this year
Dad had a close call last spring
It's a miracle he's still here
[Chorus]
But I know I'm a lucky man
God's given me a pretty fair hand
Got a house and piece of land
A few dollars in a coffee can
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And one more day to be my little kids dad
Lord knows I'm a lucky man

[Outro]
My old truck's still runnin' good
My ticker's tickin' like they say it should
I've got supper in the oven, a good woman's lovin'
And even my bad days ain't that bad
Yeah, I'm a lucky man

[Outro]
I'm a lucky, lucky man"
772,2007,The White Stripes,Icky Thump,"[Verse 1]
Ah, icky thump, who'da thunk?
Sitting drunk on a wagon to Mexico
Ahh well, what a chump
Well, my head got a bump when I hit it on the radio
Redhead señorita looking dead
Came and said, ""Need a bed?"" in Español
I said, ""Gimme a drink of water
I'm gonna sing around the collar, and I don't need a microphone""
[Verse 2]
Icky thump with a lump in my throat
Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there
On the stand near her hand was a candy cane
Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

[Verse 3]
White Americans, what? Nothing better to do
Why don't you kick yourself out? You're an immigrant too
Who's using who? What should we do?
Well, you can't be a pimp and a prostitute too
Icky thump, handcuffed to a bunk
Robbed blind, looked around, and there was nobody else
Left alone, I hit myself with a stone
Went home and learned how to clean up after myself"

774,2007,Toby Keith,High Maintenance Woman,"[Verse 1]
I see her laying by the poolside every day
She ain't got a lot on
She ain't got a lot to say

[Verse 2]
She wouldn't look my way
But buddy, what do you expect
I'm just the fix-it-up boy at the apartment complex

[Pre-Chorus]
And she'll go out dancing' 'bout 7:15
Climb into the back of a long limousine
I know where she's going
She's going downtown
I'm going downtown, too, and take a look around

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
[Verse 3]
I'm just sitting 'round waiting on a telephone call
After water pipe exploded in the living room wall
If your washer and dryer in need of repair
You know the handyman's waiting
And he'll be right there

[Pre-Chorus]
Twenty-four hours
Seven days a week
If it's getting clogged up or maybe starting to leak
Just ring up my number, baby, give me a try
You know I got all the tools
And I can satisfy
[Chorus 2]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't asked her out yet
'Cause I don't know if I can
You see a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man, man

[Chorus]
See my baby doll
She's my beauty queen
She's my movie star
Best I ever seen
I ain't hooked it up yet
But I'm trying hard as I can
It's just a high maintenance woman
Don't want no maintenance man
Ain't no high maintenance woman
Gonna fall for a maintenance man, no"

Waking up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright
But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in, it's all over me
I'm know you're here, in the dark
I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot

You've got to give me everything (Give me everything)
Nothing less 'cause you know I give you all of me (Give you all of me)
I give you everything that I am
I'm handin' over everything that I've got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Don't ever wanna have to go and give you up
Stay up till four in the morning, and the tears are pouring
And I wanna make it worth the fight
What have we been doing for all this time?
Baby, if we're gonna do it, come on, do it right

[Verse 2]
All I wanted was to know I'm safe
Don't wanna lose the love I've found

Uh, You know what it is what it is when we do what we do

[Verse 1]
If good girls get down on the floor
Tell me how low will a bad girl go
She probably pick it up drop it down real slow
Either that or she's upside down on the pole
That's when I grab the knot throw it up in the sky
Let it come down slow watch it all fly
Front to the back then side to the side
Then we head back to my crib for the night
That's how it goes down, all night long
She whisper in my ear says she loves my song
This Is Why I'm Hot, she got it on her phone
Top ten download number one ring tone
I'm in my zone tell me what's good, what it be
Can't say I'm what you want but I got what you need
All night, it's alright

We're right where I know we should be

[Chorus]
Well, oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
[Verse ]
Sometimes it's like we're deep in nothing but love
And the slightest thing can grow so foolishly
Remind me, please

[Chorus]
Oh, can't you see that for worse or for better
We're better together
Please, just come back home
And don't say that you're sorry
And I won't say I told you so
But I told you so
Should have known better
Than to leave me, baby
Should have known better
Than to leave me, darling"
784,2007,Bon Jovi,(You Want To) Make A Memory,"[Verse 1]
Hello again, it’s you and me
Kinda always like it used to be
Sipping wine, killing time
Tryna' to solve life’s mysteries
How’s your life? It’s been a while
God it’s good to see you smile
I see you reaching for your keys
Looking for a reason not to leave

[Chorus 1]
If you don’t know if you should stay
If you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-
You wanna make a memory

[Verse 2]
I dug up this old photograph
Look at all that hair we had
It’s bittersweet to hear you laugh
Your phone is ringing, I don’t wanna ask

[Pre-Chorus]
If you go now, I’ll understand
If you stay, hey, I got a plan
[Chorus 2]
You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You could sing a melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory

[Chorus]
If you don’t know if you should stay
And you don’t say what’s on your mind
Baby just, breathe there’s no where else tonight we should be-

You wanna make a memory?
You wanna steal a piece of time?
You can sing the melody to me
And I could write a couple lines
You wanna make a memory

'Cause tomorrow I might have to go and fly away
Hey!

I'm down to my last dollar I've walk right though my shoes
Just a small reminder of the hell that I've gone through
But look at me still smiling as I'm wondering what I'll do
Since I ain’t got nothing I've got nothing to lose
Everybody say ""hahaha, hahaha""
My friends are always giving me watches, hats, and wine
That's how I know this is serious that's how I know it's time
I don't have to worry about things that I don't have
'Cause if I ain't got nothing I've got nothing to hold me back

There's nothing that's worth keeping me
From places I should go
From happy Ville to loving land

I'm leaving everything behind
There's not much that I need

I'm footloose and fancy free

789,2007,Bucky Covington,A Different World,"We were born to mothers who smoked and drank
Our cribs were covered in lead based paint
No child proof lids, no seat belts in cars
Rode bikes with no helmets and still here we are, still here we are
We got daddy's belt when we misbehaved
Had three TV channels you got up to change
No video games and no satellite
All we had were friends and they were outside, playin' outside

Chorus
It was a different life
When we were boys and girls
Not just a different time
It was a different world

School always started the same every day
The pledge of allegiance then someone would pray
Not every kid made the team when they tried
We got disappointed and that was all right, we turned out all right

No bottled water, we drank from a garden hose
And every Sunday, all the stores were closed

Waiting to come to life
Waking me up to dreaming

801,2008,Leona Lewis,Bleeding Love,"[Verse 1]
Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain
Time starts to pass, before you know it you're frozen
But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Verse 2]
Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe
[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I

[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

[Bridge]
And it's draining all of me
Though they find it hard to believe
I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
[Chorus]
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
(Ooh, you cut me open and I)
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding (Oohhh)
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding (I keep...)
Keep, keep bleeding love

Ooh, you cut me open and I
Keep bleeding

I've been waitin' for my dreams
To turn into something I could believe in
And lookin' for that magic rainbow
On the horizon, I couldn't see it

[Pre-Chorus]
Until I let go, gave into love
And watched all the bitterness burn
Now I'm comin' alive, body and soul
Feelin' my world start to turn

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
Time of my life

[Verse 2]
Holdin' onto things that vanished into the air
Left me in pieces
But now I'm risin' from the ashes
Finding my wings
And all that I needed
[Pre-Chorus]
Was there all along within' my reach
As close as the beat of my heart

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
The time of my life

[Bridge]
And I'm out on the edge of forever
Ready to run
Keeping my feet on the ground
Arms open wide, face to the sun

[Chorus]
And I'll taste every moment and live it out loud
I know this is the time, this is the time to be
More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life

More than a name or a face in the crowd
I know this is the time, this is the time of my life
This is the time of my life

809,2008,Coldplay,Viva La Vida,"[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world
[Verse 3: Chris Martin]
It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever want to be king?

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-woah, oh-oh, oh

Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max

[Verse 1: Fern]
Call me OG with the young flow
Allen Iverson, no practice
That’s KD on the winning team
Got my wrist game on all axis’s
That’s big dream since the Dream Team
Now I’m on one like March Madness
Flow hot, make the climate change
Melt them polar caps causing raging weathers
I’m young enough to like slip and slide in my backyard but I never slip
Wordsmith since day one
Write a verse like a screen play
Michael Bates spitting A-1 for the sonic youth like I’m Green Day
In the field like Green Bay
Catching plays, it’s a field day
My grind game, my mind state
Well seasoned that's Garry Vee
Rap game got it locked down but I never asked it to marry me
And I’m cooking verses so legendary
This garlic parmesan, lemon pepper
This Wing Stop call it chicken dinner
This that well done and you can tell the difference
Ok, I know
[Chorus: Chris Batson]
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now

Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max

[Verse 2: Marty]
It’s Marty baby
I don’t care who your boss is
I run through the office, run through the offense
I don’t got a off switch on my awesomeness
Every beat like a Contra cartridge
Awkward with a little bit of Ye'
Pull up to a hater like aye
(Seriously, this is like the fourth song I’ve interrupted
If you don’t like our music you’re dead inside)
Saw a fight like celebrity death match
Battle any rapper who have negative feedback
Batman, Year One with a ski mask
I'm good in the hood, that’s a G pass
I don’t look back, I don’t recap
You say you the best, I don’t see that
I lost some friends that I need back
I pray so hard I need knee pads
I’m Larry David to the haters
On the way to be your favorite
On the way to see the Lakers
Never got robbed by the majors
Used to get robbed by the neighbors
I really want to make this clear
Yeah, every year is our year
Swear it’s not even fair
[Chorus: Chris Batson]
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now
You need that heat, gimmie three minutes
They doubted me, but look, we did it
Now watch me take this to the max
Ooh, to the max
Look at God look at that
Now watch me take this to the max
Cook it up when I write it down
Oh, I was late, but I'm 'bout it now

Yeah, those guys wanna come treat you right

Girl, I can tell you want something to love
That's why you hold on to everything that pass you by
Can't resist, girl, I can't lie
Now tell if you are here for me
Or everybody watchin' you shake from left to right
The way you move got me hypnotized

Can’t keep my eyes away from you, girl
When you get on the floor and do what you do
And everybody wanna come back to that body
The kind that remind me something like you
‘Cause you’re that type that drive a man crazy
And snatch him away from his lady
No matter how hard the man hold back
He'll end up callin' you, baby
And they never really know what to do
Once you expose that thing you do
You had him crawlin' on hands and knees
And you find a way to get him out that cheese
And why you thinking you're the only dude?
She off in the mall livin' off of you
Lettin' everybody know she got you
But now you feel like a fool

Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me lovin' all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It’s getting harder to breathe
It won’t be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?

[Chorus]
'Cause it’s not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it’s not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
Ooh, but I won’t go

I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all of this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in

It's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, but it's not showing

This could be the end of me

Last night, I got served a little bit too much of that poison, baby
Last night, I did things I'm not proud of
And I got a little crazy
Last night, I met a guy on the dance floor
And I let him call me baby

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
My mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no, what have I done?""
And I don't even know his last name
Woo!

[Verse 2]
We left the club, right around three o'clock in the morning
His Pinto, sitting there, in the parking lot
When it should've been a warning
I had no clue what I was getting into
So, I'll blame it on the Cuervo
Oh, where did my manners go?

[Chorus 1]
And I don't even know his last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""

And I don't even know his last name
Here we go!
[Bridge]
Today, I woke up thinking about Elvis somewhere in Vegas
I'm not sure how I got here
Or how this ring on my left hand just appeared outta nowhere
I gotta go
I take the chips and the Pinto and hit the road
They say what happens here, stays here, all of this will disappear
There's just one little problem

[Chorus 2]
I don't even know my last name
Oh, my mama would be so ashamed
It started off, ""Hey, cutie, where you from?""
And then it turned into, ""Oh, no! What have I done?""

What have I done?
What have I done?

Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold onto

Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me

I'm not gonna write you a love song

I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

Not how they should behave

Hard to obey

Professional, drinkin' X and O
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes

Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?

This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
It's time to make our move, I'm shaking off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands just take the wheel
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving, but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh

And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can you see what I see?

They're trying to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could
Steady feet, don't fail me now
I'm gonna run 'til you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down

This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers

As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face-to-face

I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by

Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon

And you never got to see me back at number one

I wish that we could spend the holidays together

With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you whatchu wanting if you keep it up

On the couch in V.I.P
Shawty, we could get it on

Girl, we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doing a dance move
Call me, so I can make it juicy for ya
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover, girl

Always wear a plastic, baby cause shit happens
She leaked the back seat, just to freak in the Magnum
Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs
She in love with the G, so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Ten black Maybachs back to back in a lane
I'mma make it rain, and I'mma make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie, that's a fact
Workin' with the police, actin' like you know me
Fresh out of jail, already in yo' hoe cheeks

So many people gonna say that they want you
To try to get you thinking they really care
But there's nothing like the warmth of the one
Who has put in the time and you know is gonna be there
Back your border when she knows someone crossed it
Don't let nobody put you down, who you're with
Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the highwire

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a girl who knows me better
Fell for the woman just when I met her
Took my sweet time when I was bitter
Someone understands
And she knows how to treat a fella right
Give me that feeling every night
Wants to make love when I wanna fight
Now someone understand me
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)
I'm in love with a girl (I'm in love with)

Out the many broken backdoors and windows
Through the valley of the love of the lost
Is a hole that is cut through the soul falling down
From the thrones without any innuendos
But you found it a piece for the moment
The moment was over in time
Then it's gone, the hit and run
The drifters one has a short life

When you see a deer you see Bambi
And I see antlers up on the wall
When you see a lake you think picnics
And I see a largemouth up under that log
You're probably thinking that you're going to change me
In some ways well maybe you might
Scrub me down, dress me up, oh, but no matter what
Remember, I'm still a guy

[Verse 2]
When you see a priceless French painting
I see a drunk, naked girl
You think that riding a wild bull sounds crazy
And I'd like to give it a whirl
Well, love makes a man do some things he ain't proud of
And in a weak moment I might walk your sissy dog, hold your purse at the mall
But remember, I'm still a guy

[Chorus]
I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground
'Cause he copped a feel as you walked by
[Verse 3]
I can hear you now talking to your friends
Saying, ""Yeah girls he's come a long way""
From dragging his knuckles and carrying a club
And building a fire in a cave
But when you say a backrub means only a backrub
Then you swat my hand when I try
Well, now, what can I say at the end of the day
Honey, I'm still a guy

And I'll pour out my heart
Hold your hand in the car
Write a love song that makes you cry
Then turn right around, knock some jerk to the ground

These days there's dudes getting facials
Manicured, waxed and botoxed
With deep spray-on tans and creamy lotiony hands
You can't grip a tacklebox

But I don't highlight my hair

Oh, thank God I'm still a guy"

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me

They don't feel me but they fear me

She was staring out the window, of that SUV
Complaining, saying, I can't wait to turn 18
She said, I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules
Mama put the car in park out there in front of the school
And she kissed her head and said, I was just like you

[Chorus]
You're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

[Verse 2]
Before she knows it she's a brand new bride
In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by
He tells her, it's a nice place
She says, it'll do for now
Starts talking about babies, and buying a house
Daddy shakes his head, and says, baby, just slow down

[Chorus]
Cause you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast
These are some good times
So take a good look around
You may not know it now
But you're gonna miss this

Five years later, there's a plumber working on the water heater
Dog's barking, phone's ringing
One kid's crying, one kid's screaming
She keeps apologizing
He says, they don't bother me
I've got two babies of my own
One's 36, one's 23
Heh... It's hard to believe, but

But you're gonna miss this
You're gonna want this back
You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast

846,2008,David Cook,Billie Jean,"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Gonna dance on the floor in the round

People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Not my son

Billie Jean is not my lover

In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah

I move on like a sinners prayer
Letting go like a levee breaks
Walk away as if I don't care
Learn to shoulder my mistakes
I'm built to fade like your favorite song
Getting reckless when there's no need
Laugh as your stories ramble on
Break my heart, but it won't bleed
My only friends are pirates
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man

[Verse 2]
Never sure when the truth won't do
I'm pretty good on a lonely night
I move on the way a storm blows through
I never stay, but then again, I might
I struggle sometimes to find the words
Always sure until I doubt
Walk a line until it blurs
Build walls too high to climb out
But I'm honest to a fault
That's just who I am
I'm better as a memory than as your man
[Bridge]
I see you leaning, you're bound to fall
I don't want to be that mistake
I'm just a dreamer and nothing more
You should know it before it gets too late

[Verse 3]
Cause goodbyes are like a roulette wheel
You never know where they're gonna land
First you're spinning, then you're standing still
Left holding a losing hand
But one day you're gonna find someone
And right away you'll know it's true
That all of your seeking's done
It was just a part of the passing through
Right there in that moment you'll finally understand
That I was better as a memory than as your man
Better as a memory than as your man"

A strangled smile fell from your face
It kills me that I hurt you this way
The worst part is that I didn't even know
Now there's a million reasons for you to go
But if you can find a reason to stay

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance, believe that I can change
I'll keep us together whatever it takes

She said ""If we're going to make this work
You gotta let me inside even though it hurts
Don't hide the broken parts that I need to see""
She said, ""Like it or not it's the way it's gotta be
You gotta love yourself if you can ever love me""

[Chorus]
I'll do whatever it takes to turn this around
I know what's at stake, I know that I've let you down
And if you give me a chance and give me a break
I'll keep us together, I know you deserve much better

But remember the time I told you the way that I felt
That I'd be lost without you and never find myself
Let's hold onto each other above everything else
Start over, start over

I woke up kind of early today and something told me from that moment it wouldn't be the same
Felt like you were hiding something, but I didn't push it

Well, this heart of mine has been hardened like a stone
It might take some time to get back what is gone
But I'm moving on and you don't haunt my dreams
Like you did before
Oh, when I would curse your name
Hey!
Well I heard the news that you were back in town
Just passing through to claim your lost and found
But I'm over you and there ain't nothing there
That you could say or do to take what you did back

Well you got nerve to waltz right in
And think what's mine is yours again

'Cause I've been doing fine without you
Forgetting all the love we once knew
And girl, I ain't the one who slammed that door
But now you say you've changed your thinking
But I ain't got a heart for breaking
So go and pick your bags up off my floor
Oh, 'cause love don't live here anymore
Oh no

Well baby, you can try to tell me how it is
And try to justify everything you did
But honey, I'm no fool
Oh, and I've been down this road
Too many times with you

Well, I got one thing left to say
Is you can lay in the bed you've made

I can take apart the remote control
And I can almost put it back together
I can tie a knot in a cherry stem
I can tell you about Leif Ericson
I know all the words to ""De Colores""

Me and my friend made a comic book
And guess how long it took?
I can do anything that I want 'cause look—

No metronome, no metronome
And I can see your face on the telephone
On the telephone, on the telephone

Alive, in such a small world
I'm all curled up with a book to read
I can make money, open up a thrift store
I can make a living off a magazine
I can design an engine sixty-four miles to a gallon of gasoline
I can make new antibiotics
I can make computers survive aquatic conditions
I know how to run a business
And I can make you wanna buy a product
Movers, shakers, and producers
Me and my friends understand the future
I see the strings that control the systems
I can do anything with no resistance 'cause—

With a microphone, with a microphone
And I can split the atom of a molecule
Of a molecule, of a molecule

Or let 'em all die in exasperation
Have 'em all healed from their lacerations
Or have 'em all killed by assassination
I can make anybody go to prison
Just because I don't like 'em
And I can do anything with no permission
I have it all under my command because—

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

[Refrain]
If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

[Refrain]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Uncle Joe and Uncle Jake
Haven't spoken since '98
Just said, 'Hello'
It's a good day to let it go

Chorus

So let the angels gather
Let the music play
Let the preacher get to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love is a beautiful thing
2nd Verse

Daddy's waitin' with the bride
Yeah, she helps him with his tie
She sees a tear
He says, 'Man, it's hot in here' hmm
He hugs his little girl and asks
'How did you grow up so fast?
God, I wish your Momma could be here for this'

Pre Chorus

And everybody stands and smiles
As she goes walkin' down the aisle
In her Momma's gown
And Daddy breaks on down
Gran and Gramps in the second row
Stood right there fifty years ago
And said their vows
Yeah, I guess it's workin' out

(Repeat Chorus)
Bridge

A little table full'a gifts
Catering's covered dish
And the wedding band
Well, that's on her hand
And Tommy's teasin' Lorelei
He pushed her down and made her cry
And neither one knows
A day will come
Tag Chorus

When the angels gather
And the music plays
And the preacher gets to preachin' all the ""do you take""'s
Love is a beautiful thing
Throw the rice in the air
Let the church bells ring
Tie the cans to the back of that limosine
Love
Two people in love is a beautiful thing"
868,2008,George Strait,I Saw God Today,"[Verse 1]
Just walked down the street to the coffee shop
Had to take a break
I've been by her side for eighteen hours straight
Saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk
Pushing up through the concrete
Like it was planted right there for me to see

The flashing lights
The honking horns
All seem to fade away
But in the shadow of the hospital
At 5:08
I saw God today

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down and stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I Saw God Today
[Verse 2]
Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But I noticed that she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

[Chorus]
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's there
But I don't look
Near as often as I should

[Verse 3]
Got my face pushed up against the nursery glass
She's sleeping like a rock
My name on her wrist
Wearing tiny pink socks
She's got my nose
She's got her Mama's eyes
My brand new baby girl
She's a miracle
I Saw God Today"

870,2008,Taylor Swift,Picture To Burn,"[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn"
871,2008,Blake Shelton,Home,"[Chorus 1]
Another summer day has come and gone away in Paris and Rome
But I want to go home
May be surrounded by a million people I, still feel all alone
I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know

[Verse 1]
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you
Each one a line or two, I'm fine baby, how are you
I would send them but I know that it's just not enough
My words were cold and flat and you deserve more than that

[Chorus 2]
Another airplane, another sunny place, I'm lucky I know
But I want to go home, I've got to home
Let me go home
I'm just too far from where you are, I want to come home

[Verse 2]
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life
It's like I just stepped outside when everything was goin' right
And I know just why you could not come along with me
This was not your dream, but you always believed in me

[Chorus 3]
Another winter day has come and gone away in even Paris and Rome
And I want to go home, let me go home
And I'm surrounded by a million people I, still feel alone
And I want to go home, oh, I miss you, you know
[Outro]
Let me go home
I've had my run, baby I'm done, I'm comin' back home
Let me go home
It'll all be alright, I'll be home tonight, I'm coming back home"

I got fade-away money, bitch, I'm ballin' out the gym
Got my old school pumpin', hip wheel on recline
If you think a nigga broke, you out'cha monkey-ass mind (ayy)
Diamonds on my pinky (ayy), hand on the pine
Bitch touch and now your momma do the second line
Screens fallin' from the sky, syrup fallin' in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin' down, nigga, what?
Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got Gs on my ass, bitch, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can gon' pass the mic, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck
Still screamin' out mayne (mayne), pistol in my hand
Southside so throwed (throwed in the game)
Big face on my chain, 84s on the frame
Big bodies comin' down, hoggin' up both lanes

The name you know of
A little bit of change, now your boy done blown up
In them foreign thangs with the guts exposed
Stunting ain't a thing to me, and it's obvious, it's plain to see
That you gon' make us both
Get into some thangs that is for grown folks
And they might even say you should leave me alone
Don't be scared, you need to get like me
Stunting is a habit, just gotta have it
Shorty keep throwing that thang at me, I'm gonna bag it
When she see the karats, a real Jessica Rabbit
Can't another boy do the things you like
He ain't your type to change your life, but if you did ya homework
Girl, I'm pretty sure you know what I got, drop-tops
And you know Jones and Banner gonna roll, let me stop
Stunting is a habit

Let them bougie boys ride Maybach
I'm in the candy, laid back like I slang crack
My money stacked to the ceilin'
Gettin' in my Chevy's like climbin' up a buildin', them 28's on deck
37 on my wrist, a hundred five on my neck
This rap money's okay but you should see these movie checks
And this cartoon cash, the SS so sweet
My Bentley's hatin' on that ass, my old school's gettin' pissed
She opened up her arm but then she slit both wrists
There go them suicide doors (doors), wood on the dash
Ferris wheels on the toes and got duals on the ass
And some chrome on the nose, the white boys go, ""Sweet""
But black folks go, ""Oh,"" I got a 'llac full of ammo
I'm brick with the nine throwin' bombs out the Lambo' (uh)
The butterflies goin' up
I got Chad in my heart and DJ Screw in my cup

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

[Chorus: Adam Levine, Rihanna, Both]
'Cause you keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

[Verse 2: Rihanna & Adam Levine]
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine & Rihanna]
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind

Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
(Talk to me, yeah, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more

[Verse 1: Kid Shokora]

I'm doing me like Siamese incest
We're about to raise up the roof like bench press
All the pretty girls in the place start dancin'
And all the nerds in the place start spazzin'
No gown, no gavel, no judgment
And baby girl swallows like it's Robitussin
Ugh
Now that's distasteful
And niggas talking trash and that's just wasteful
I don't need to say how I'm a great MC
I'll just sit back and let my words speak for me
Do re mi fa so la ti do
That's fake orange juice I call that Tarentino
And that's Pulp Fiction
You found a new addiction
Comeback Music's what you've been missin
McCloud
David is the 1st name
Similar to Bruce Wayne
I'm on fire where's the Propane

(Chorus)x2
New kids on the block we're fresh to undeath
Cooking up beats call us the Iron Chef
Dancing on the floor can you keep up girl
All they can say is let me catch my breath
All they can say is let me catch my breath (x2)

Give me a second let me catch my breath

[Verse 2: Kid Raven]

Oh no it's the kids are back off the shelf
Making new sounds that you have never felt
Vibrating on rhythm yes its a new culture
The nerd is back guess I'm the one who told ya
So come on girl move those hips around
Whenever the kids are coming back in town
Taking shots, who called in the firing squad
I make music just to hear the crowd applaud
(Yaaaaaaay)
Why am I lying I make music cuz I love it
So much to the point that no one I know is above it
Enjoying the party when the music turns on
Keep it going on night like a bedroom marathon
(Bang Bang)
I beat the drums real hard
Let me stop now before I take it too far
To the next level is where this song's taking me
Regenerating my power like I took a hit of V
Cuz yes I'm a monster, we've established this
Vampire teeth showing, would you like a kiss
From the sin-inspiring creature that I am
Girls only know me cuz I make them go Ka-Blam
At the end of the night, they're melting like Melt-Man
Brusing up the skin, changing them like a sun tan
Girls say I'm smooth so they call me lotion
Hey what can I say, Sinsation is the man
(Chorus)x2

[Verse 3: Kid Frosty]

When I walk in you bitches know I'm here to smack face
Do it on the 1st try, never hit a backspace
Wanna blow me, now you should've done it in the 1st place
Praising the Lord but you're living on my grace
I can screw girls who wouldn't let you get to 1st base
Word around the campfire, rapper's saying I'm fake
Acting like It's my fault I'm whiter than a milkshake
But I get all the love cuz I get them so baked

And if I'm right, we're headed straight for hell

I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
If he wants a fight, well, now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet

Don't that sound like a real man?
I'm gonna show him what little girls are made of
Gunpowder and lead

Well, it's half past ten, another six-pack in
And I can feel the rumble like a cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, the gravel flies
He don't know what's waitin' here this time

Hey, I'm going home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette

I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)

881,2008,Montgomery Gentry,Back When I Knew It All,"[Verse 1]
At the ripe old age of nineteen
I bought a short bed pick up chicks machine
Life ran on beer and gasoline
A half a lap ahead of the law
I had a fake I d that got me into ""Tuffies""
Love was a word I used to get lucky
Was a big time spender with that plastic money
Back when I knew it all

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Verse 2]
I found out credit cards don't mean you're rich
And beer and gasoline don't mix
Yeah step side trucks can't jump a ditch
And those ""big house"" rooms sure are small
I've learned that love is a woman that will settle you down
A sunday sermon can turn life around
Man I can't believe all the answers I've found
Since, back when I knew it all
[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all

[Bridge]
I've done some growing up
And I'm still growing up
So I know I'll never be
As smart as I once was
That was back

[Chorus]
Back when the world was flat and
Mama and daddy didn't have a clue
That was back
Back when a pitcher of beer and a
Couple shots made me bulletproof
Back when god was a name I used in vain
To get a point across when I got ticked off
Lord I'm learning so much more than
Back when I knew it all"
882,2008,New Kids On The Block,Summertime,"[Intro]
Jones Beach, 1988
Come on

[Verse 1]
Do you remember or should I rewind?
To that summer when you caught my eye?
I played it cool, the weather was hot
You had the beauty & the beach on lock
With your flip flops, half shirt, short shorts, mini skirt
Walkin' on the beach, so pretty
You wasn't lookin' for a man
When you saw me in the sand
But you fell for the boy from the city

[Pre-Chorus]
I was like ""Hey, girl, can I get your number?""
I remember what you told me too
""Don't call after 10:00""
But you know that I did
Cause I couldn't stop thinkin' 'about you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
[Verse 2]
Do you remember? I'll never forget
Touchin' your body all soakin' wet
The water was cool, the feelin' was hot
Kissin' on you while the ocean rocked
In your strapless sundress
Kickin' back, no stress
As long as we was together
Cause we were feelin' young love
And we couldn't get enough
Baby, I could reminisce forever

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And now I'm like
Hey, girl, don't you know I miss it?
And I wonder if you miss it too?
Never thought it would end 'til it did
Now, I'm here and I can't stop thinkin' 'about you

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime
[Bridge]
(Break it down)
Summer ended, winter started
It got colder when we parted ways
(I like this part)
As the seasons change
(Now bring it, bring it back)
Winter melted, spring, I felt it
Summertime will never be the same
Without you, my summertime
My summertime

[Chorus]
I think about you in the summertime
And all the good times we had, baby
Been a few years and I can't deny
The thought of you still makes me crazy
I think about you in the summertime
I'm sittin' here in the sun with you on my mind
My summertime"
883,2008,Taylor Swift,Should've Said No,"[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me"

885,2008,Dierks Bentley,Trying To Stop Your Leaving,"[Verse]
Got a guitar
Got a guitar on my back
And I'm standing on this lonesome railroad track
Train's a coming
It'll be here before too long
But I don't think I can stop it with a song
Girl that's the kind of way I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
Got a pebble
Got a pebble in my hand
And I toss it out into the middle of the Rio Grande
But the river keeps running
Don't even know that I'm around
I could throw a million more and not slow it down
Girl that's kind of what I'm feeling
Trying to stop your leaving
There's nothing that I wouldn't try
If I thought it would change your mind
But you don't love me
No you don't love me anymore
And I know as soon as you walk out that door

[Outro]
Train's a coming, river's running
Train's a coming, river's running
Pain's a coming, tears are running
Yeah that's kind of the way I'm feeling
Knowing I couldn't stop your leaving"

Pick up my baby and turn it around

887,2008,Julianne Hough,That Song In My Head,"You were hangin' your feet off
The tailgate of Billy Don's Ford
I grew up in this little bitty town
Never seen you before
You were swayin' in the moonlight
While the radio played
And I've
I've had that song in my head all day, yeah

It was a sweet Southern soulful thing
That got me down deep
You caught me starin' at you
But you smiled back at me
Started slingin' that air guitar
Man, you sure can play
And I've had that song in my head all day

I don't know who sings it
I keep searchin' the radio
I just wanna hear it
So I can watch that video
I got in my head of a blue-eyed boy
Dancin' in the bed of a two-tone Ford
Oh Lord, is it love?
I just can't say
(But I've)
(I've had that song in my head all day)
(Playin' in my head all day)
I said, 'How 'bout an autograph for 'ya
Your biggest fan?'
You wrote your name and your number
In the palm of my hand
My heart and that big bass speaker
Were thumpin' away, and I
I've had that song in my head all day"

I'd like to than Mr. Bryan-Michael Cox for helping me illustrate my feelings

But for real, this is gotta be the last time
It's gon' be the best though, promise
Just one last time

'Cause if she catch me with you, she gon' kill us
These hotel rooms is looking too familiar
Your love is so, so serious

She just don't deserve this
Ain't nobody perfect but I just can't take no more 'cause

I'm living two different lives
One girl in the day, you at night
And even though this ain't right
I just can't get enough of the way you put it down
You really got me tripping
Hold up, baby girl, don't talk, just listen
Girl for the last time

See the problem is I'm too deep involved
To be playing with your emotions, you really got me open

Not my baby, no

But girl, you just so fine, give it to me one last time
Baby, let your hair down, take it to the bed now
Spread them lovely legs now, one last round

Let's keep this thing on the low for the last time

But there's only one condition, baby, please don't fuss
Don't be tripping, keep it pimping
Baby girl, let's just make love
I'm living two different lives

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again (Ow!)
-Min' home again

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
[Chorus: Chris Martin]
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town

I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as lovers can, you know
Yeah, we're feeling so good
Picking up things we shouldn't read
It looks like the end of history as we know
It’s just the end of the world
Back to the street where we began
Feeling as good as love, you could, you can

[Pre-Chorus]
Into a place where thoughts can bloom
Into a room where it's nine in the afternoon
And we know that it could be
And we know that it should
And you know that you feel it too

[Chorus]
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
And your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good
[Verse 2]
Back to the street, down to our feet
Losing the feeling of feeling unique
Do you know what I mean?
Back to the place where we used to say
""Man, it feels good to feel this way""
Now I know what I mean
Back to the street, back to the place
Back to the room where it all began, hey
Back to the room where it all began

[Chorus]
'Cause it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon
Your eyes are the size of the moon
You could 'cause you can, so you do
We're feeling so good just the way that we do
When it's nine in the afternoon"
897,2008,Chris Cagle,What Kinda Gone,"I heard the door slam
And I couldn't tell was it just the wind
Or was she mad again - ah hell
She's gettin in her car
I hollered baby is there something wrong
Thought I heard her say something sounded like I'm gone
But these days gone can mean so many things

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here

Well its gettin dark out, she ain't back yet
Ain't called home, turned off the phone
Ah man hah this might not be good
I would have stopped her, when she went to leave
But I didn't 'cause I didn't really think what I'm thinkin now
I'm still not sure what gone is all about

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers
I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout here
Is it the kind of gone where she's at her mom's cooling down
She'll come around or the kind that says you had your chance
And she ain't comin back

Well theres gone for good and theres good and gone
And theres gone with the long before it
I wish she'd been just a little more clear
Well theres gone for the day and gone for the night
And gone for the rest of your dogone life
Is it whiskey night or just a couple beers

I mean what kind of gone are we talkin bout
What kinda gone are we talkin bout

Take the light
And darken everything around me
Call the clouds
And listen closely, I'm lost without you

[Chorus]
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

[Verse 2]
Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

[Chorus]
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

I'll mend myself before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
And I'll rise above this, rise above this
Forty eight ways to say
That I'm feeling helpless
I've fallen down, fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Rise above this, rise above this doubt"

I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

[Verse 2]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
[Chorus]
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

[Bridge]
In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
Across this new divide

910,2009,Kris Allen,No Boundaries,"[Verse 1]
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever, when you feel you’ve lost your way
And what if my chances are already gone?
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
To fight and never walk away

[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

[Chorus]
With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

[Verse 2]
I fought to the limit to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe, but I always knew why
I always knew why
[Pre-Chorus]
So here I am still holdin' on

[Chorus]
With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You’ll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you’ve almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can

[Bridge]
You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries
Above and beneath you
Break every rule 'cause there’s nothing between you and your dreams

With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
Yeah
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
With every step, you climb another mountain

Haha, not again
Oh, this ain't supposed to happen to me

[Break: Kanye West]
Keep rocking, and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin it up or Reebokin'
You see the hate that they're serving on a platter
So what we gonna have, dessert or disaster?

[Verse 1: Keri Hilson]
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you, my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like I'm in a race, but I already won first place
I never thought I'd fall for you as hard as I did (As hard as I did, yeah)
You got me thinking 'bout our life, our house, our kids, yeah
Every morning, I look at you and smile
'Cause boy, you came around
And you knocked me down, knocked me down

[Chorus: Keri Hilson]
Sometimes, love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Sometimes, love comes around
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
I never thought I'd hear myself say (Say, mmm)
""Y'all go 'head"" (Oh)
""I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today""
(Kick it with my girl today)
I used to be commander-in-chief
On my pimp ship, flying high (Flying high)
'Til I met this pretty little missile (Oh)
That shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky, uhh)
Hit, so now, I'm crashing (Don't know how it happened)
But I know it feels so good
Said if I could go back and (Make it happen faster)
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could? (Oh)
Miss Independent (To the fullest)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you, the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes, love...

Sometimes, love comes around (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Keri Hilson, (Keri Hilson)]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dreams
That seemed to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby; we just happened
So, please, don't mess up the trick
""Hey Young World,"" I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick, but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average for advice?
OMG, you listen to that bitch?
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying; now, I'm crashing (Oh)
This is bad, real bad—Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad—Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'ma ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa, mm) I'll admit it, I was scared to answer love's call
(Whoa, whoa) And if it hits better make it worth the fall
When it comes around, hey
[Chorus: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around
(Love comes around, love comes around)
Comes around, whoa
And it knocks you down
Just get back up when it knocks you down, knocks you down
Get back up when it knocks you down
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around)
When love comes around
And it knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Just get back up when it knocks you down
Knocks you down (Eh-eh, oh-oh)
Knocks you down

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh-huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down
Oh, no, when it knocks you down
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down

And she’s an actress (Actress), but she ain’t got no need
She’s got money from her parents in a trust fund back East
T—t—t—tongues always pressed to your cheeks
While my tongue is on the inside of some other girl’s teeth

918,2009,Adam Lambert,Mad World,"[Verse 1]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places
Worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going no where
Going no where
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression
No expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow
No tomorrow

[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very, mad world, mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Made to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen
Sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me
No one knew me
Hello teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me
Look right through me
[Chorus]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very, mad world, mad world

[Outro]
Mad world
Mad world"
919,2009,Keith Urban,Kiss A Girl,"[Intro]
To kiss and tell, it's just not my style
But the night is young, and it's been awhile and she broke my heart, broke it right in two
And it took some time but I'm feeling like I'm finally ready to find, find somebody new

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

[Verse 1]
It's that moment when you start closing in
First you're holding back, then surrendering
It can start a fire, light up the sky, such a simple thing
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl
[Verse 2]
'Cause maybe tonight it could turn into the rest of our lives, oh yeah
Are you ready? Are you ready..to cross that line, put your lips on mine??
(Put your lips on mine baby)
Do you wanna try?
Are you ready to say good-bye to all these blues?

[Verse 3]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic baby
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But no one should be lonely, I shouldn't be lonely

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss a girl
I wanna hold her tight
Maybe make a little magic in the moonlight
Don't wanna go too far just to take it slow
But I shouldn't be lonely in this big old world
I wanna kiss a girl

Oh I wanna kiss her now"

Hey, walk out of the house with my swagger
Hop in, there we go, I got places to go
People to see, time is precious
I look at my Cartier, outta control
Just like my mind where I'm goin'
No women, no shorties, no nothin' but clothes
No stoppin' now, my Pirellis on roll
I like my jewelry that's always on gold
I know the storm is comin'
My pockets keep tellin' me it's gonna shower
Call up my homies
It’s on and poppin tonight cause it’s meant to be ours
We keep a fadeaway shot
Cause we be ballin', it's platinum Patron that be ours

Don't open my mouth, let her talk to my bands
My Benjamin Frank-a-lins
A couple of grands, I got rubberbands
My paper planes making her dance
Get dirty all night, that's part of my plan
We building castles that's made out of sand
She's amazing, her fire blazing, hotter than cajun
Girl won't you move a lil' closer?
Time to get paid, it's maximum wage
That body belongs on a poster
I'm in a daze, that bottom is waving at me, like dammit I know ya
Doing a show like a gun out of holster
Tell me whatever then I'll be your chauffeur ('Cause)

I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me

And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass

I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

Ayy, let me kick it to you right quick, man
Not on some gangsta shit, man, on some real shit
Anybody done been through the same thing
I'm sure you feel the same way
Big Phil, this for you, pimpin'

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ever had one of them days wish you woulda stayed home
Run into a group of niggas who gettin' they hate on?
You walk by, they get wrong
You reply, then shit get blown
Way outta proportion, way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one, then rush him
Figure you get jumped, hell, that's nothin'
They don't wanna stop there, now they bustin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin' you
To the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus you hit four times, bullet hit yo' spine
Paralyzed waist-down, now you're wheelchair-bound
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive
Just think, it all started, you fussin' with three guys
Now your pride in the way, but your pride is the way
You could fuck around, get shot, die any day
Niggas die everyday, all over bullshit
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood shit
Could this be ‘cause of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually niggas don't know what to do when
Their back against the wall, so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blow, I guess
From Bankhead up to yo projects
[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & T.I.]
Ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
And ohh, I've been travelin' on this road too long (Too long)
Just tryin' to find my way back home (Back home)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone, hey

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragic situation
Coulda been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that shit didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin' and rappin'
Niggas start shit, next thing you know, we cappin'
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad
Now think about, damn, what a life I had!
Most of that shit, look back, just laugh
Some shit, still look back, get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the nigga in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my nigga walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more
Cost a nigga his jaw, cost me more
I'da took that ass-whoopin' now for sure
Now, think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripes
A nigga put his hands on me, alright
Otherwise, stand there, talk shit all night
'Cause I hit you, and you sue me
I shoot you, get locked up, who? Me?
[Pre-Chorus: T.I.]
No more stress, now I'm straight
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think before I make
Mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets, I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side

Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride

But the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone
But the new me will be alright 'cause

929,2009,Kelly Clarkson,My Life Would Suck Without You,"[Verse 1]
Guess this means you're sorry
You're standin' at my door
Guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again

[Chorus]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was stupid for tellin' you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for tryna pick a fight
I know that I've got issues
But you're pretty messed up too
Either way I found out
I'm nothing without you

[Chorus]
'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me
And honestly
My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you

Being with you is so dysfunctional
I really shouldn't miss you
But I can't let you go

My life (My life) would suck (Would suck) without you, yeah

930,2009,The Fray,You Found Me,"[Verse 1]
I found God
On the corner of First and Amistad
Where the west
Was all but won
All alone
Smoking his last cigarette
I said, ""Where you been?""
He said, ""Ask anything""
Where were you
When everything was falling apart?
All my days
Were spent by a telephone
That never rang
And all I needed was a call
That never came
To the corner of First and Amistad

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me
[Verse 2]
In the end
Everyone ends up alone
Losing her
The only one who's ever known
Who I am
Who I'm not, and who I wanna be
No way to know
How long she will be next to me

[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Bridge]
For early morning
The city breaks
And I've been calling
For years and years and years and years
And you never left me no messages
You never send me no letters
You got some kind of nerve
Taking all I want
[Chorus]
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Where were you? Where were you?
Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lying on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

[Outro]
Why'd you have to wait
To find me? To find me?"
931,2009,Kelly Clarkson,I Do Not Hook Up,"[Verse 1]
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
You got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you found it
Slow motion sparks, you caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys'll be boys, oh, yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're lookin' for thrills, then get cold feet

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

[Verse 2]
I can't cook, no, but I can clean
Up the mess she left
Lay your head down and feel the beats
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last, but this is now
So love the one you're with
You want a chase, but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well
[Chorus]
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep
'Cause the more that you try, the harder I'll fight
To say—

'Cause I feel the distance between us
Could be over
With a snap of your finger, oh, no

Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I go slow
So if you want me, I don't come cheap
Keep your hand in my hand and your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no, I do not hook up, up, I fall deep

Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act
And you don't know where your life is going?
Am I supposed to be torn apart
Broken-hearted in a corner crying?
Pardon me if I don't show it

Get yourself together

Cut my hair 'cause it reminded me of you

Thinking of changing up how I ride
No more on the passenger's side
Too bad you missed out on the way that I drive it

933,2009,Taylor Swift,Love Story,"[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Oh, oh, oh

Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gonna to stay
Ain't No Sunshine when she's gone

And this house just ain't no home

937,2009,Zac Brown Band,Whatever It Is,"[Verse 1]
She's got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And her pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in a room I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile knock a grown man to his knees

[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

[Verse 2]
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
People ask me what it is
I tell them I don't know
There's just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
She's gonna be my wife
[Chorus]
She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you""
You got whatever it is

When she loves me
Girl that's how I feel
When she loves me I'm on top of the world
Because when she loves me I can live forever
When she loves me I am untouchable

She's got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I want to say to a woman
But I couldn't find the words to say
She's got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out ""I love you"" (I do)
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is"

I remember trying not to stare
The night that I first met you
You had me mesmerized
And three weeks later
In the front porch light
Taking 45 minutes to kiss goodnight
I hadn't told you yet
I thought I loved you then

[Chorus]
Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I remember taking you back
To right where I first met you
You were so surprised
There were people around
But I didn't care
I got down on one knee right there
And once again
I thought I loved you then

Now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl
Like a river meets the sea
Stronger than it’s ever been
We've come so far since that day
And I thought I loved you then

I can just see you
With a baby on the way
I can just see you
When your hair is turning grey
What I can't see
Is how I'm ever going to love you more
But I've said that before

[Chorus 2]
And now you're my whole life
Now you're my whole world
I just can't believe
The way I feel about you girl

At this moment that we're in

939,2009,Nickelback,If Today Was Your Last Day,"[Verse 1]
My best friend gave me the best advice
He said each day's a gift and not a given right
Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind
And try to take the path less traveled by
That first step you take is the longest stride
(What if, what if?)

[Chorus 1]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have?
(What if, what if?)
If today was your last day
(What if, what if?)
(If today was your last day)

[Verse 2]
Against the grain should be a way of life
What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
So live like you'll never live it twice
Don't take the free ride in your own life
(What if, what if?)
[Chorus 2]
If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)
Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
Swear up and down to God above
That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
If today was your last day

[Bridge]
If today was your last day
Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
Regardless of who you are
So do whatever it takes (Takes)
'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
'Cause the hands of time are never on your side

If today was your last day
And tomorrow was too late
Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
Would you live each moment like your last?
Leave old pictures in the past?
Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)
And would you call old friends you never see?
Reminisce old memories?
Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)

And by the light of the moon she rubs her eyes
Says it's funny how the night can make you blind
I can just imagine (imagine)
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
But if she feels bad then I do too
So I let her be

To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
Way down (way down)

Well she sits down and stares into the distance
And it takes all night (all night)

Oh, but it don't feel right

Sits down on the bed and starts to cry
And there's something less about her

Her diamonds falling
Oh I can't take no more
Her tears like diamonds on the floor
And her diamonds bring me down
Cause I can't help her now
She down with it
She tried her best and now she can't win, It's hard
To see them on the ground
Her diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down
I can't take no more
Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling down yeah

Diamonds on the floor (no more, no more, no more)
Diamonds falling over her diamonds falling down

942,2009,Sugarland,It Happens,"[Verse 1]
Missed my alarm clock ringing
Woke up, telephone screaming
Boss man singing his same old song
Rolled in late about an hour
No cup of coffee, no shower
Walk of shame with two different shoes on
Now it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all

[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing
Life don't go quite like you planned it
We try so hard to understand it
The irrefutable, indisputable fact is
Pshh it happens

[Verse 2]
My trusty-rusty had a flat
I borrowed my neighbors cadillac
""I'll be right back,"" going down to wally world
That yellowed light turned red too quickly
Knew that truck the moment it hit me
Out stepped my ex and his new girl
""Sorry 'bout your neck baby""
But it's poor me, why me, oh me, boring
The same old worn out blah blah story
There's no good explanation for it at all
[Chorus]
Ain't no rhyme or reason
No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it
Let go laughing

No complicated meaning
Ain't no need to over think it

Yeah, the irrefutable, indisputable, absoluteable, totally beautiful fact is...Pshh, it happens"
943,2009,Charice,Note To God,"[Verse 1:]
If I wrote a note to God
I would speak what's in my soul
I'd ask for all the hate
To be swept away
For love to overflow

If I wrote a note to God
I'd pour my heart out on each page
I'd ask for war to end
And for peace to mend this world
I'd say, I'd say

I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on

[Verse 2:]
If I wrote a note to God
I'd say please help us find a way
End all the bitterness
Put some tenderness in our hearts
I'd say, I'd say
[Chorus:]
I'd say give us the strength
To make it through
Help us find love
'Cause love is overdue
And it looks like
We haven't got a clue
Need some help from you

Grant us the faith to carry on
Give us hope
When it seems all hope is gone
'Cause it seems like
So much is going wrong
On this road we're on

No, no
We can't do it on our own
So, so

No, no
We can't do it on our own

Hey girl, what's your name?
It's so loud in here I can't hear a thing
But I sure do like your style
And I can see you came to rock
In your blue jeans and white tank top;
Man that look drives me wild

[Chorus]
And it's hey now here we go
D-j don't you play nothing slow
Keep those girls out on the floor

Gonna get a little bit sideways...
Sideways

Ain't no need to fight

You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find

All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

How could you be so heartless?
Oh, how could you be so heartless?

Cold as the winter wind when it breeze, yo?
Just remember that you talkin' to me though
You need to watch the way you talkin' to me, yo
I mean, after all the things that we been through
I mean, after all the things we got into
Ayo, I know of some things that you ain't told me
Ayo, I did some things but that's the old me

So you walk around like you don't know me
You got a new friend, well, I got homies
But in the end, it's still so lonely

Why we up 3 AM on the phone?
Why do she be so mad at me fo'?
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
I won't stop, won't mess my groove up
‘Cause I already know how this thing go
You run and tell your friends that you're leavin' me
They say that they don't see what you see in me
You wait a couple of months, then you gon' see
You'll never find nobody better than me

Talk and talk and talk and talk
Baby, let's just knock it off
They don't know what we been through
They don't know 'bout me and you
So I got somethin' new to see
And you just gon' keep hatin' me
And we just gon' be enemies
I know you can't believe
I could just leave it wrong
And you can't make it right
I'm gon' take off tonight into the night

You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down home, country girl

[Verse 1]
She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all

Country (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
She's country
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
Country
Brother, she's country

[Verse 2]
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
Brother, she's all

Country, (shoot)
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots

Verse 1:
They overdosing on my swag
Put the whole god damn hood in rehab
Too many rumples in my duffle
Can't close this bag its so much cash
I need 10 hands now to count my cash
LL Cool Gucci Mane I'm back
Never need a mask best check my stash
You must be hall-u-cin-a-tin
1st day out girl ain't you glad?
6 supermodels crashing at my pad
I should be a model drinking outta gold bottles
With some tru religion jeans sagging off my ass
Please don't crash am I goin' to fast
Touchdown anywhere I don't need no pass
Might need some gum cause I'm finna talk trash
Cuz keep em on task like a kid at class
Hater can't hit what a hater can't see
Untouchable these haters sure can't see me
He wouldn't know a hit if you hit him in the head
With a 4 by 4 standing 6 foot 3
Ready for a bitch, crocodile dun sheet
Never met a girl I ain't fuck first week
You never seem a g throw a 10,000 white mink
On the floor live on B.E.T (Gucci)
[Hook]
I only got life I can live
There's only so much game I can give
So you could watch the show chillin' at your crib
And weeks turn to months, and months turn to years
But I be smoking dro, Ima fuck some hoes
Ima ball today, wake up, then go ball some more
Can't tell a grown man what to do with his
It's your prerogative Ima mind my biz
But Ima live the life, forever rocking ice
Throwing money popping bottles cause that's just what I like
(x2)

Verse 2:
Screaming I'mma be like the Black Eyed Peas
I wanna be free and you wanna be me
Best eased if you really want beef
Ima fight you by the trees looking like swiss cheese
Just came home ain't thinking bout sleep
Bitch ya favorite rapper ain't slept in weeks
Thinkin' bout me like I'm down the street
Know it's over soon as my feet touch concrete
Pull up in South Beach blowing on trees
Whipping down the street like I'm riding on D's
A new ferrari flying down Peachtree
Girl I might roll ya window down Gucci Mane please
Make sure 2010 I'm free,fall off in the booth like 1017
Before I'm through fire jumping out the roof but we dont need water please bring more weed
Niggas can't win now they wanna switch teams, can't entertain that by no means
You wanna get on nigga chase your dreams,stop chasing me down like a dope fiend
Starting off my day with an M-16, shit ain't been the same since I turned 16
My whole life changed, now it's so icy
1st album on the charts came out same week (Gucci)

Verse 3:
My auntie had a stroke and she still can't speak, wrote me every week real talk thats deep
Ex-cell mate gotta 35 piece, won't be released till 2033

Can't look back and watch the moves I make
But the moves that I made fuck around and move me

See things now, I didn't before now wishin' I had more time with you
How do you stay awake knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about then never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way, I'll come and getcha girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

Cause I couldn't get you off my mind, if I tried

Twenty-four/seven, three six five
And my nights so cold, days so long
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone

Well it's gone and I'm trippin', how much I miss it
And you steady walkin' round, like I never existed
And it's hard to understand, you got another plan
Tryin' to play hard, that you got another man

But you'll never find another like moi
That'll ridin' you round in a drop-top car
Baby you're a star and it's time that you know it
So much love and it's time that we sow it

The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand?
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
""Shady, man, no, don't massacre the fans!""
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him, just ‘cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it, then squish it, then pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes, he can-can; don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbian offend
But Lindsay, please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl, in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

[Verse 2: Eminem]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and charley-horse her
Sorry, Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler and two Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner, then
Nail her, baby, say hello to my little friend!
Brit, forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give 'em an inch
They take a mile; they got style, but it isn't Slim
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)

[Bridge: Eminem]
And that's why, my love
You'll never live without
I know you want me, girl
'Cause I can see you checking me out
And baby, you know
You know you want me too
Don't try to deny it, baby
I'm the only one for you (*fart*)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Damn, girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad, you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man, Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal, but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (Blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
""Lord, help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!""
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter of fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl
[Chorus: Charmagne Tripp & Eminem]
When you walked through the door (Woo!)
It was clear to me (Clear to me)
You’re the one they adore
Who they came to see (Who they came to see)
You’re a rock star (Baby)
Everybody wants you (Everybody wants you)
Player, who can really blame you? (Who can really blame you?)
We’re the ones who made you

I was born by the river, in a little tent
Oh, and just like the river
I've been running ever since

It's been a long
A long time coming

956,2009,Montgomery Gentry,One In Every Crowd,"Golden Tee, shuffleboard, pinball, he's got the score
That everybody around here's tryin to beat
He's a six pack up when he walks in
Tells the band crank it up to 10
Then he's up dancin on his seat
Well he's a big mouth, yellin' hey play some free bird
Says give me three steps and nobody gets hurt
Then he takes off his shirt

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
Brings the party in us out
Good time Charley with a Harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

Got a fliptop box of Marlboros
He'll bum a light and steal your girl
Then laugh at you for gettin' all upset, well everybody here knows his name
Makes everybody else look sane
When he's out, as far as you can get
In his mind he's a rock star, crankin' out that air guitar
Til the bartender says fool, get off my bar

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd
He's a hard drinkin man's man
And women love him when they can
He's a bartender's best friend
It ain't a party till he walks in

[Chorus:]
There's one in every crowd
That brings the party in us out
Good time charley with a harley, whiskey bent and hellbound
He's got the next round, but he always drinks for free
There's one in every crowd, and it's usually me
Hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd

It's usually me, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, hey ya'll, there's one in every crowd, that's right"

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 1]
Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days

Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about

She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?

I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you

From the day we met 'til you were making me cry

958,2009,Daughtry,No Surprise,"[Verse 1]
I've practiced this for hours, gon' 'round and 'round
And now I think that I've got it all down
And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds
'Cause I'm not taking the easy way out
Not wrappin' this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

[Verse 2]
It came out like a river, once I let it out
When I thought that I wouldn't know how
Held onto it forever, just pushing it down
It felt so good to let go of it now
Not wrapping this in ribbons
Shouldn't have to give a reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow
There's nothing here in this soul left to save
Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow
God knows we tried to find an easier way
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise
[Bridge]
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The lovin' look that's left your eyes
That's why this comes as no, as no surprise

[Verse 3]
If I could see the future and how this plays out
I bet it's better than where we are now
But after going through this
It's easier to see the reason why

[Chorus]
It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow
I can't believe that I stayed 'til today
Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise

[Outro]
The kiss goodnight, it comes with me
Both wrong and right, our memories (our memories)
The whispering before we sleep
Just one more thing that you can't keep (you can't keep)
Our favorite place we used to go
The warm embrace that no one knows
The loving look that's left your eyes
But I know in time, we'll find this was no surprise"

Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on

I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

I might just disappear

We went out last night
Like we swore we wouldn't do
Drank too much beer last night
A lot more than we wanted to
There were girls from Argentina and Arkansas
Maine, Alabama and Panama
All mixed together and having a ball

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were two karaoke girls drunk on a dare
Singing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny and Cher
Yeah, life was good everywhere
We went out last night

[Verse 2]
Well you know I'm a music man
I grew up in east Tennessee
Last night I was everything
When I got a few drinks in me
I was a doctor, a lawyer, a senator's son
Brad Pitt's brother and a man on the run
Anything I thought would get the job done
[Chorus 2]
Yeah, we went went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Hitting on everybody and their mother
There were people doing body shots up on the bar
Jimmy in a fist fight out by the car
Everybody was some kind of star
When we went out last night

[Bridge]
Well the fact that I'm still breathing
Means that I must have survived
And that I lived to go out with my friends again tonight

[Chorus 3]
Oh, We went out last night
One thing started leading to another
Out last night
Everybody started loving on each other
They were dancing on the tables
And howling at the moon
Pairing off together and pretty soon
There was not a sole in sight

I'm doing well

Right there on his grave

People around got to find something to say now
Holding back, every day the same
Don't want to be a loner, listen to me, oh no
I never say anything at all
So with nothing to consider, they forget my name

[Chorus 1]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
They call me 'quiet' girl
But I'm a riot
Mary-Jo-Lisa
Always the same
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
[Verse 2: Katie]
I miss the catch if they throw me the ball
I'm the last drip standing up against the wall
Keep up, falling, these heels they keep me boring
Getting clamped up and sitting on the fence now
So alone all the time at night
Lock myself away, listen to me, I'm not
Though I'm dressed up out and all
With everything considered, they forget my name

[Chorus: Katie]
They call me Hell
They call me Stacey
They call me her
They call me Jane
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name
That's not my name

That's not my name

This song was in my head
Now it's in my mind
Call it, reach it, get some words and get some timing
And though I realize
I cannot emphasize
I'll stick around but just don't promise, nothing binding
And baby, can't you see
That you're so desperately
A standing joker like a vocal one-liner
Instead of sing-a-long
This song is monotone
I've gotta get some soul, I gotta get some feeling

Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?
Are you calling me Darling?
Are you calling me Bird?

969,2009,Alan Jackson,Sissy's Song,"[Verse 1]
Why did she have to go
So young I just don't know why
Things happen half the time
Without reason, without rhyme
Lovely, sweet young woman
Daughter, wife and mother
Makes no sense to me
I just have to believe

[Chorus]
She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

[Verse 2]
Loved ones she left behind
Just tryin' to survive
And understand the why
Feelin' so lost inside
Anger shot straight at God
Then askin' for His love
Empty with disbelief
Just hopin' that maybe
[Chorus]
She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

[Bridge]
It's hard to say goodbye
Her picture in my mind
Will always be of times I'll cherish
And I won't cry 'cause

She flew up to heaven on the wings of angels
By the clouds and stars and passed where no one sees
And she walks with Jesus and her loved ones waitin'
And I know she's smilin' sayin', don't worry 'bout me

Don't worry 'bout me

Across the water, across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby, I'm trying

971,2009,Adam Lambert,No Boundaries,"[Intro]
Ohhh hmmm

[Verse 1]
Seconds, hours, so many days
You know what you want, but how long can you wait?
Every moment lasts forever
When you feel you've lost your way
And what if my chances were already gone
I started believing that I could be wrong
But you gave me one good reason
To fight and never walk away
So here I am still holding on

[Chorus]
With every step you climb another mountain
With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
[Verse 2]
I fought to the limit, to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
Jumped every bridge, run every line
I risk being safe
I always knew why
I always knew why
So here I am still holding on

[Chorus]
With every step you climb another mountain
With every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
When you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can

[Bridge]
You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries above and beneath you
Break every rule because there's nothing between you
And your dreams
[Chorus 2]
With every step you climb another mountain
Every breath it's harder to believe
You make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up everything
They take you by the hand
And show you that you can
There are no boundaries

There are no boundaries, yeah
There are no boundaries

There are no boundaries, yeah

972,2009,Jason Michael Carroll,Where I'm From,"On a three-hour flight from Memphis to LA
I was silently celebrating my first-class upgrade
Laughing at my jeans and my boots beside those high-dollar shoes and Armani suits
When the gentleman next to me said the drinks up here are free
So if you'd like the first one can be on me
He said I'm heading back from business, in New York and Rome
Tell me son, where do you call home?

I said I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames and
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from

So we drank that round and then another
There wasn't a topic in this world we did not cover
He said I headed out west when I was barely 19
Just a kid chasing my dreams
And I said I'm flying out here to pick up my big brother
He's been fighting the cancer they discovered
But he called last night and said I think this is the end
So come take me home to my family and my friends

Where the quarterback dates the homecoming queen
The trucks a Ford and the tractor's green
And ""Amazing Grace"" is what we sing
Where there's a county fair every fall
And your friends are there no matter when you call
It may not sound like much but it's where I'm from
And as we stood to claim the bags we checked
He said I'll pray for your brother and did I mention that
Italian suits haven't always been my style
See I was the quarterback of my high school team
We took state back in '63 and my wife well she is still my homecoming queen

Cause I'm from the front pew of a wooden white church
A courthouse clock that still don't work
Where a man's word means everything
Where moms and dads were high school flames
Gave their children Grandmother's maiden name
Yes, it may not sound like much
I said it may not sound like much
But it's where I'm from
Amazing Grace
It's where I'm from
How sweet the sound
It's where I'm from
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, amazing grace"
973,2009,Seether,Careless Whisper,"[Verse 1]
I feel so unsure
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor
As the music dies, something in your eyes
Calls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you

[Verse 2]
Time can never mend
The careless whispers of a good friend
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
[Bridge]
Tonight the music seems so loud
I wish that we could lose this crowd
Maybe it's better this way
We hurt each other with the things we wanna say
We could have been so good together
We could have lived this dance forever
Now who's gonna dance with me
Please stay

[Chorus]
I'm never gonna dance again
These guilty feet have got no rhythm
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool
I should have known better than to cheat a friend
And waste a chance that I've been given
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you"

And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way
One day I thought I'd see her with her daddy by her side
And violins would play here comes the bride

You can't stop me, motherfucker, 'cause I'm on a boat
Take a picture, trick (trick); I'm on a boat, bitch (bitch)
We drinking Santana champ, cause it's so crisp (crisp)
I got my swim trunks, and my flippie-floppies
I'm flipping burgers, you at Kinko's straight flippin' copies
I'm riding on a dolphin, doing flips and shit (yeah)
The dolphin's splashing, getting everybody all wet (oh)
But this ain't Seaworld, this as real as it gets (yeah, yeah)
I'm on a boat, motherfucker, don't you ever forget
I'm on a boat, and it's going fast, and
I got a nautical themed pashmina afghan
I'm the king of the world, on a boat like Leo
If you're on the shore, then you're sho' not me-oh

Get the fuck up, this boat is real!

Gonna fly this boat to the moon somehow (moon somehow)
Like Kevin Garnett, anything is possible

[Bridge: T-Pain & Andy]
Yeah, never thought I'd be on a boat (let's go)
It's a big, blue, watery road (yeah)
Poseidon, look at me, oh (all hands on deck)
Never thought I'd see the day
When a big boat coming my way
Believe me when I say
I fucked a mermaid, whoah

980,2009,Eli Young Band,Always The Love Songs,"[Verse 1]
We used to pull off Highway 249
Had a cool little place where we'd go and hide on Friday night
And get away from the city lights
We'd find a little wood and build a fire
Somebody'd always bring a couple guitars
And we'd take turns singin' songs and watching it burn
We'd do ""Ramblin' Man"", ""Proud Mary"", and ""American Band""
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Verse 2]
There was always a line that stuck in your head
That was said in a way you wished you could've said
But you both knew they were singin' it right to you
It felt so good those times you had
That feelin' of wanting somebody so bad
Made you weak in the heart, you couldn't take being apart
Honky Tonk drinkin' songs, we could do 'em all night long
But the ones we remember most
[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs

[Bridge]
We'd be singin' at the top of our lungs

[Chorus]
It was always the love songs every time
Made everybody feel something inside
With the fire down low, held your girl real close
Made you wanna love the one you were with
Gave you the courage for that first kiss
It was the love songs, always the love songs
Always the love songs, always the love songs"
981,2009,Adam Lambert,One,"[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus 1]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus 2]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?
[Chorus 3]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Chorus 4]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, and my brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

982,2009,Rodney Atkins,It's America,"[Verse 1]
Driving down the street today I saw a sign for lemonade
They were the cutest kids I'd ever seen in this front yard
As they handed me my glass, smiling thinking to myself
Man, what a picture-perfect postcard this would make of America

[Chorus]
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America

[Verse 2]
Later on when I got home, I flipped the TV on
I saw a little town that some big twister tore apart
And people came from miles around just to help their neighbours out
And I was thinking to myself I'm so glad that I live in America

[Chorus]
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song, it's a ride in a Chevrolet
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids selling lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America

[Bridge]
Now we might not always get it all right
There's no place else I'd rather build my life
But yeah, 'cause it's a kid with a chance, it's a rock 'n roll band
It's a farmer cuttin' hay
It's a big flag flyin' in a summer wind
Over a fallen hero's grave
[Outro]
It's a high school prom, it's a Springsteen song
It's a welcome home parade, yeah
It's a man on the moon and fireflies in June and kids sellin' lemonade
It's cities and farms, it's open arms, one nation under God
It's America! It's America! Oh, oh yeah, woo!"

You say you gotta go and find yourself
You say that you're becoming someone else
Don't recognize the face in the mirror looking back at you
You say you're leaving as you look away
I know there's really nothing left to say
Just know I'm here whenever you need me
I'll wait for you

[Chorus]
So I'll let you go, I'll set you free
And when you've seen what you need to see
When you find you, come back to me

Take your time, I won't go anywhere
Picture you with the wind in your hair
I'll keep your things right where you left them

984,2009,Eminem,Insane,"[Produced by Dr. Dre]

[Verse 1]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah, fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snuck in and said
""We're going out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed""
Can't we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
""After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest,"" the next day my mother said
""I don't know what the fuck's up with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!""
""Debbie, don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin' cigarette to his neck
I'll bet you he's fakin' it, I'll bet you, I bet
He probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object?""
""Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head!""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
[Verse 2]
""Did you get him?"" Nah, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin' chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades, stuck a baseball in a slingshot
Then he aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping pong
Then he played ping pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants, he took every fuckin' thing off
Everything except his tank top and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that's Shady, dawg
Man that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he dawg?
Shady, dawg, what be goin' through that fuckin' brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along!

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane!
[Verse 3]
Don't you know what felch means? (""Yeah"") Well then, tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you're belching (Urrp!)
Burp, belch, and go back for a second helping
Can you dig what I'm saying, man? Can you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me (Oh...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelping
""Shady, what the fuck you saying?"" — I don't know, help me!
What the fuck's happening? I think I'm fuckin' melting!
""Marshall, I just love you, boy, I care about your well-being""
No, Dad, I said no! — I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me a movie like Nightmare on Elm Street
But it was X and they called it ""Pubic Hair on Chelsea""
""Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene!""

[Chorus]
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it
Is he nuts? No, he's insane
If you could count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I've completely lost it

Was awfully crazy, I wish we taped it
I danced my ass off

Drink my beer and smoke my weed

Go out to eat, then do it again
Man, I love college

I am champion, at beer pong

Like don't pass out with your shoes on
And don't leave the house, 'till the booze gone
And don't have sex, if she's too gone
When it comes to condoms, put two on
Then tomorrow night, find a new jawn
Hold the beer bong, nothing wrong with some fun
Even if we did get a little bit too drunk
Time isn't wasted, when you're getting wasted
Woke up today, and all I could say is

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yessir!
Check me out, look

[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
26 inches, bitch I'm sittin' crooked
Old school Chevy, faster than a silver bullet
Strawberry paint; seats, vanilla puddin'
Two bitches, go'n'n' and eat each other's pussy
Top chopped sent the car to the barbershop
My driveway looks somethin' like a parkin' lot
I'm so unorthodox
I got your bitch ridin' my dick wit no shocks
(Bounce bitch, bounce, bounce)
I'm the hottest shit jumpin' out the coffee pot
Man, I'm just tryin' to get my spot like a polka dot
Lil' kush make my eyes and my shoulders drop
Lil' syrup and I can make a soda pop
Keep talkin' 'n' I can make my soldiers pop
Real niggas wit me ridin' till the motor stop
I got these hoes straight livin' out the soap op
I got it covered like a coke top
Okay?
[Hook]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

Always strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back
Bitches be lovin' me, they know I love 'em back

[Verse 2: Mack Maine:]
I'm Mack Maine, hey
Hey, to a man with a ho with some pop trunk
I fuck over you like I'm sexin' on the top bunk
I make alot of noise, boy, like a cop car
The whip got the dicks out like a pop bra
And you ain't gotta ask your girl... you knew she knew me
From ring tones she sing my songs at the karaoke
She call me baby all day like I'm Bryan Williams
The new hip-hop landlord I'm 'bout to buy the buildin'
And I'm evictin' all you cats that only spit an ounce
And like a stripper ass you better bounce diggity, bounce, bounce

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Yeah shawty, the last MOB
Flyin' the Bugatti with the tool on the seat
Put the K in the car while we ridin' blaze
Put the chopper on the pussy in the driveway
Bet the house on the young 'un when we got paid
Triple colors on the bikes and the new Merced'
Bustin' keys on they ass while we got paid
From I-10's ridin' hot to an open bay
Uptown made man out the hallway
Crab in the bucket 50 shots bitch make a way
I thought they knew shawty, Like Father Like Son
Ball till you fall, stuntin' wit them paper plates
Throwin' hundreds on them hoes while we eat steaks
We in the club poppin' bottles like everyday
We grind for the shine, nigga, gettin' big money
Got a fleet tossin' chicken, nigga, get cake
I'm on his island with this power like Scarface
I'm in the Impala droptop, chunky
Ice man birdman rockin' red monkeys
Already, nigga, neighborhood superstar
And  we gon' ball til we fall

Always Strapped when I hit the club
Niggas give me dap, bitches give me hugs, and since I'm paid
Niggas be muggin' me, you know I'm muggin' back

992,2009,Maxwell,Pretty Wings,"[Verse 1]
Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, no residual feelings within ya
One day you won't remember me
Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same
Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found the remedy, I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave, I have to live
I had to lead, I had to live

[Chorus]
(If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your pretty wings
Your pretty wings, pretty wings around
[Verse 2]
I came wrong, you were right
Transformed your love into light
Baby, believe me, I'm sorry I told you lies
I turned day into night
Sleep 'til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you
Better nights, better times, better days
And I miss you more and more

[Chorus]
If I can't have you, let love set you
Free to fly your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings your

993,2009,Kris Allen,Falling Slowly,"I don't know you, but I want you all the more for that
Words fall through me and always fool me and I can't react
And games that never amount to more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice, you have a choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly eyes that know me and I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me and I'm painted black
You have suffered enough and warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice you had the choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing along"

Shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man but I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

Why the bottom, why da basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for da need to replace me?
Ya on a runway track from the good
I want to paint in the pictures any way we could, react
Like the heart in a trash where you should
You done gave it away, ya' had it 'til you took it back
But I keep walkin' on, keep rockin' dawns
Keep walking forward, now the court is yours
Keep browsin' halls, 'cause I don't wanna live in a broken home

Sitting here alone tonight thinking 'bout a lot of things

Hell I know deep down inside my broken heart

Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer
Dug down just a little bit deeper
Let the world revolve around you
And give you the stars above
Loved you just enough to make you stay
And I'd lost you anyway

I hate it when it's like this, baby it's like that now
Nothing I can say to you, you even care to talk about
How you going to dress it up, wrap it in a pretty bow
When it's gone, it's gone for good, baby at least I know

Could've tried just a little bit harder
Kissed you just a little bit sweeter
Held on just a little bit longer

Ain't meant to be
That's why I tell myself

[Chorus: Ciara]
If that boy don't love you by now
(If that boy don't love you by now)
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
Oh oh
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
(He will never ever love you)
He will never ever, never ever love you

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Alright, alright, alright, okay...
I see ya point, I must admit
I grind, I grind, I grind all day
This paper's what I'm tryna get
Now normally when I'm paper chasing
I be having tunnel vision
And if it's really like that lady
Just turn on ya television
And there go Young
I said there go Young
You tryna get it did
Just know I gets it done
She love the way I cheat
She love the way I move, I sh, I show it to her
Shows about 100, goon
Its blacks this, black that
Black car, black flags
I really hope that's money that ya'll got off in them black bags
808's & heartbreak, states who puts interstates
Giving me a bad vibe, guess I'm just a bad guy
[Breakdown: Ciara with Polow Da Don]
Throw yo' hands up in the air
If ya know he love ya
Tell the DJ play this song right here
If ya know he love ya
Let, let, let, let me see you two-step
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya

[Outro: Ciara]
If ya know he love ya
Let me see you two-step
If ya know he love ya
It don't matter if you by yourself
If ya know he love ya
If that boy don't love you by now
He will never ever, never ever love you
He will never ever, never ever love you
If that boy don't love you by now"
